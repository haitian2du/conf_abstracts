Learning End-to-End Scene Flow by Distilling Single Tasks Knowledge,"Scene flow is a challenging task aimed at jointly estimating the 3D structure and motion of the sensed environment. Although deep learning solutions achieve outstanding performance in terms of accuracy, these approaches divide the whole problem into standalone tasks (stereo and optical flow) addressing them with independent networks. Such a strategy dramatically increases the complexity of the training procedure and requires power-hungry GPUs to infer scene flow barely at 1 FPS. Conversely, we propose DWARF, a novel and lightweight architecture able to infer full scene flow jointly reasoning about depth and optical flow easily and elegantly trainable end-to-end from scratch. Moreover, since ground truth images for full scene flow are scarce, we propose to leverage on the knowledge learned by networks specialized in stereo or flow, for which much more data are available, to distill proxy annotations. Exhaustive experiments show that i) DWARF runs at about 10 FPS on a single high-end GPU and about 1 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 embedded at KITTI resolution, with moderate drop in accuracy compared to 10× deeper models, ii) learning from many distilled samples is more effective than from the few, annotated ones available."
A Variational Autoencoder with Deep Embedding Model for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,"Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a challenging task that aims to recognize not only unseen classes unavailable during training, but also seen classes used at training stage. It is achieved by transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes via a shared semantic space (e.g. attribute space). Most existing GZSL methods usually learn a cross-modal mapping between the visual feature space and the semantic space. However, the mapping model learned only from the seen classes will produce an inherent bias when used in the unseen classes. In order to tackle such a problem, this paper integrates a deep embedding network (DE) and a modified variational autoencoder (VAE) into a novel model (DE-VAE) to learn a latent space shared by both image features and class embeddings. Specifically, the proposed model firstly employs DE to learn the mapping from the semantic space to the visual feature space, and then utilizes VAE to transform both original visual features and the features obtained by the mapping into latent features. Finally, the latent features are used to train a softmax classifier. Extensive experiments on four GZSL benchmark datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state of the arts."
Ultrafast Photorealistic Style Transfer via Neural Architecture Search,"The key challenge in photorealistic style transfer is that an algorithm should faithfully transfer the style of a reference photo to a content photo while the generated image should look like one captured by a camera. Although several photorealistic style transfer algorithms have been proposed, they need to rely on post- and/or pre-processing to make the generated images look photorealistic. If we disable the additional processing, these algorithms would fail to produce plausible photorealistic stylization in terms of detail preservation and photorealism. In this work, we propose an effective solution to these issues. Our method consists of a construction step (C-step) to build a photorealistic stylization network and a pruning step (P-step) for acceleration. In the C-step, we propose a dense auto-encoder named PhotoNet based on a carefully designed pre-analysis. PhotoNet integrates a feature aggregation module (BFA) and instance normalized skip links (INSL). To generate faithful stylization, we introduce multiple style transfer modules in the decoder and INSLs. PhotoNet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. In the P-step, we adopt a neural architecture search method to accelerate PhotoNet. We propose an automatic network pruning framework in the manner of teacher-student learning for photorealistic stylization. The network architecture named PhotoNAS resulted from the search achieves significant acceleration over PhotoNet while keeping the stylization effects almost intact. We conduct extensive experiments on both image and video transfer. The results show that our method can produce favorable results while achieving 20-30 times acceleration in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art approaches. It is worth noting that the proposed algorithm accomplishes better performance without any pre- or post-processing."
PsyNet: Self-Supervised Approach to Object Localization Using Point Symmetric Transformation,"Existing co-localization techniques significantly lose performance over weakly or fully supervised methods in accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we overcome common drawbacks of co-localization techniques by utilizing self-supervised learning approach. The major technical contributions of the proposed method are two-fold. 1) We devise a new geometric transformation, namely point symmetric transformation and utilize its parameters as an artificial label for self-supervised learning. This new transformation can also play the role of region-drop based regularization. 2) We suggest a heat map extraction method for computing the heat map from the network trained by self-supervision, namely class-agnostic activation mapping. It is done by computing the spatial attention map. Based on extensive evaluations, we observe that the proposed method records new state-of-the-art performance in three fine-grained datasets for unsupervised object localization. Moreover, we show that the idea of the proposed method can be adopted in a modified manner to solve the weakly supervised object localization task. As a result, we outperform the current state-of-the-art technique in weakly supervised object localization by a significant gap."
Detecting Human-Object Interactions via Functional Generalization,"We present an approach for detecting human-object interactions (HOIs) in images, based on the idea that humans interact with functionally similar objects in a similar manner. The proposed model is simple and efficiently uses the data, visual features of the human, relative spatial orientation of the human and the object, and the knowledge that functionally similar objects take part in similar interactions with humans. We provide extensive experimental validation for our approach and demonstrate state-of-the-art results for HOI detection. On the HICO-Det dataset our method achieves a gain of over 2.5% absolute points in mean average precision (mAP) over state-of-the-art. We also show that our approach leads to significant performance gains for zero-shot HOI detection in the seen object setting. We further demonstrate that using a generic object detector, our model can generalize to interactions involving previously unseen objects."
Incremental Multi-Domain Learning with Network Latent Tensor Factorization,"The prominence of deep learning, large amount of annotated data and increasingly powerful hardware made it possible to reach remarkable performance for supervised classification tasks, in many cases saturating the training sets. However the resulting models are specialized to a single very specific task and domain. Adapting the learned classification to new domains is a hard problem due to at least three reasons: (1) the new domains and the tasks might be drastically different; (2) there might be very limited amount of annotated data on the new domain and (3) full training of a new model for each new task is prohibitive in terms of computation and memory, due to the sheer number of parameters of deep CNNs. In this paper, we present a method to learn new-domains and tasks incrementally, building on prior knowledge from already learned tasks and without catastrophic forgetting. We do so by jointly parametrizing weights across layers using low-rank Tucker structure. The core is task agnostic while a set of task specific factors are learnt on each new domain. We show that leveraging tensor structure enables better performance than simply using matrix operations. Joint tensor modelling also naturally leverages correlations across different layers. Compared with previous methods which have focused on adapting each layer separately, our approach results in more compact representations for each new task/domain. We apply the proposed method to the 10 datasets of the Visual Decathlon Challenge and show that our method offers on average about 7.5× reduction in number of parameters and competitive performance in terms of both classification accuracy and Decathlon score."
Monocular 3D Object Detection with Decoupled Structured Polygon Estimation and Height-Guided Depth Estimation,"Monocular 3D object detection task aims to predict the 3D bounding boxes of objects based on monocular RGB images. Since the location recovery in 3D space is quite difficult on account of absence of depth information, this paper proposes a novel unified framework which decomposes the detection problem into a structured polygon prediction task and a depth recovery task. Different from the widely studied 2D bounding boxes, the proposed novel structured polygon in the 2D image consists of several projected surfaces of the target object. Compared to the widely-used 3D bounding box proposals, it is shown to be a better representation for 3D detection. In order to inversely project the predicted 2D structured polygon to a cuboid in the 3D physical world, the following depth recovery task uses the object height prior to complete the inverse projection transformation with the given camera projection matrix. Moreover, a fine-grained 3D box refinement scheme is proposed to further rectify the 3D detection results. Experiments are conducted on the challenging KITTI benchmark, in which our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy."
Auto-GAN: Self-Supervised Collaborative Learning for Medical Image Synthesis,"In various clinical scenarios, medical image is crucial in disease diagnosis and treatment. Different modalities of medical images provide complementary information and jointly helps doctors to make accurate clinical decision. However, due to clinical and practical restrictions, certain imaging modalities may be unavailable nor complete. To impute missing data with adequate clinical accuracy, here we propose a framework called self-supervised collaborative learning to synthesize missing modality for medical images. The proposed method comprehensively utilize all available information correlated to the target modality from multi-source-modality images to generate any missing modality in a single model. Different from the existing methods, we introduce an auto-encoder network as a novel, self-supervised constraint, which provides target-modality-specific information to guide generator training. In addition, we design a modality mask vector as the target modality label. With experiments on multiple medical image databases, we demonstrate a great generalization ability as well as specialty of our method compared with other state-of-the-arts."
Feature Deformation Meta-Networks in Image Captioning of Novel Objects,"This paper studies the task of image captioning with novel objects, which only exist in testing images. Intrinsically, this task can reflect the generalization ability of models in understanding and captioning the semantic meanings of visual concepts and objects unseen in training set, sharing the similarity to one/zero-shot learning. The critical difficulty thus comes from that no paired images and sentences of the novel objects can be used to help train the captioning model. Inspired by recent work (Chen et al. 2019b) that boosts one-shot learning by learning to generate various image deformations, we propose learning meta-networks for deforming features for novel object captioning. To this end, we introduce the feature deformation meta-networks (FDM-net), which is trained on source data, and learn to adapt to the novel object features detected by the auxiliary detection model. FDM-net includes two sub-nets: feature deformation, and scene graph sentence reconstruction, which produce the augmented image features and corresponding sentences, respectively. Thus, rather than directly deforming images, FDM-net can efficiently and dynamically enlarge the paired images and texts by learning to deform image features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used novel object captioning dataset, and the results show the effectiveness of our FDM-net. Ablation study and qualitative visualization further give insights of our model."
General Partial Label Learning via Dual Bipartite Graph Autoencoder,"We formulate a practical yet challenging problem: General Partial Label Learning (GPLL). Compared to the traditional Partial Label Learning (PLL) problem, GPLL relaxes the supervision assumption from instance-level — a label set partially labels an instance — to group-level: 1) a label set partially labels a group of instances, where the within-group instance-label link annotations are missing, and 2) cross-group links are allowed — instances in a group may be partially linked to the label set from another group. Such ambiguous group-level supervision is more practical in real-world scenarios as additional annotation on the instance-level is no longer required, e.g., face-naming in videos where the group consists of faces in a frame, labeled by a name set in the corresponding caption. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) called Dual Bipartite Graph Autoencoder (DB-GAE) to tackle the label ambiguity challenge of GPLL. First, we exploit the cross-group correlations to represent the instance groups as dual bipartite graphs: within-group and cross-group, which reciprocally complements each other to resolve the linking ambiguities. Second, we design a GCN autoencoder to encode and decode them, where the decodings are considered as the refined results. It is worth noting that DB-GAE is self-supervised and transductive, as it only uses the group-level supervision without a separate offline training stage. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DB-GAE significantly outperforms the best baseline over absolute 0.159 F1-score and 24.8% accuracy. We further offer analysis on various levels of label ambiguities."
Learning Deep Relations to Promote Saliency Detection,"Though saliency detectors has made stunning progress recently. The performances of the state-of-the-art saliency detectors are not acceptable in some confusing areas, e.g., object boundary. We argue that the feature spatial independence should be one of the root cause. This paper explores the ubiquitous relations on the deep features to promote the existing saliency detectors efficiently. We establish the relation by maximizing the mutual information of the deep features of the same category via deep neural networks to break this independence. We introduce a threshold-constrained training pair construction strategy to ensure that we can accurately estimate the relations between different image parts in a self-supervised way. The relation can be utilized to further excavate the salient areas and inhibit confusing backgrounds. The experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly boost the performance of the state-of-the-art saliency detectors on various benchmark datasets. Besides, our model is label-free and extremely efficient. The inference speed is 140 FPS on a single GTX1080 GPU."
Hierarchical Online Instance Matching for Person Search,"Person Search is a challenging task which requires to retrieve a person's image and the corresponding position from an image dataset. It consists of two sub-tasks: pedestrian detection and person re-identification (re-ID). One of the key challenges is to properly combine the two sub-tasks into a unified framework. Existing works usually adopt a straightforward strategy by concatenating a detector and a re-ID model directly, either into an integrated model or into separated models. We argue that simply concatenating detection and re-ID is a sub-optimal solution, and we propose a Hierarchical Online Instance Matching (HOIM) loss which exploits the hierarchical relationship between detection and re-ID to guide the learning of our network. Our novel HOIM loss function harmonizes the objectives of the two sub-tasks and encourages better feature learning. In addition, we improve the loss update policy by introducing Selective Memory Refreshment (SMR) for unlabeled persons, which takes advantage of the potential discrimination power of unlabeled data. From the experiments on two standard person search benchmarks, i.e. CUHK-SYSU and PRW, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, which justifies the effectiveness of our proposed HOIM loss on learning robust features."
Binarized Neural Architecture Search,"Neural architecture search (NAS) can have a significant impact in computer vision by automatically designing optimal neural network architectures for various tasks. A variant, binarized neural architecture search (BNAS), with a search space of binarized convolutions, can produce extremely compressed models. Unfortunately, this area remains largely unexplored. BNAS is more challenging than NAS due to the learning inefficiency caused by optimization requirements and the huge architecture space. To address these issues, we introduce channel sampling and operation space reduction into a differentiable NAS to significantly reduce the cost of searching. This is accomplished through a performance-based strategy used to abandon less potential operations. Two optimization methods for binarized neural networks are used to validate the effectiveness of our BNAS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BNAS achieves a performance comparable to NAS on both CIFAR and ImageNet databases. An accuracy of 96.53% vs. 97.22% is achieved on the CIFAR-10 dataset, but with a significantly compressed model, and a 40% faster search than the state-of-the-art PC-DARTS."
End-to-End Learning of Object Motion Estimation from Retinal Events for Event-Based Object Tracking,"Event cameras, which are asynchronous bio-inspired vision sensors, have shown great potential in computer vision and artificial intelligence. However, the application of event cameras to object-level motion estimation or tracking is still in its infancy. The main idea behind this work is to propose a novel deep neural network to learn and regress a parametric object-level motion/transform model for event-based object tracking. To achieve this goal, we propose a synchronous Time-Surface with Linear Time Decay (TSLTD) representation, which effectively encodes the spatio-temporal information of asynchronous retinal events into TSLTD frames with clear motion patterns. We feed the sequence of TSLTD frames to a novel Retinal Motion Regression Network (RMRNet) to perform an end-to-end 5-DoF object motion regression. Our method is compared with state-of-the-art object tracking methods, that are based on conventional cameras or event cameras. The experimental results show the superiority of our method in handling various challenging environments such as fast motion and low illumination conditions."
Zero-Shot Ingredient Recognition by Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Network,"Recognizing ingredients for a given dish image is at the core of automatic dietary assessment, attracting increasing attention from both industry and academia. Nevertheless, the task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting and labeling sufficient training data. On one hand, there are hundred thousands of food ingredients in the world, ranging from the common to rare. Collecting training samples for all of the ingredient categories is difficult. On the other hand, as the ingredient appearances exhibit huge visual variance during the food preparation, it requires to collect the training samples under different cooking and cutting methods for robust recognition. Since obtaining sufficient fully annotated training data is not easy, a more practical way of scaling up the recognition is to develop models that are capable of recognizing unseen ingredients. Therefore, in this paper, we target the problem of ingredient recognition with zero training samples. More specifically, we introduce multi-relational GCN (graph convolutional network) that integrates ingredient hierarchy, attribute as well as co-occurrence for zero-shot ingredient recognition. Extensive experiments on both Chinese and Japanese food datasets are performed to demonstrate the superior performance of multi-relational GCN and shed light on zero-shot ingredients recognition."
Rethinking the Bottom-Up Framework for Query-Based Video Localization,"In this paper, we focus on the task query-based video localization, i.e., localizing a query in a long and untrimmed video. The prevailing solutions for this problem can be grouped into two categories: i) Top-down approach: It pre-cuts the video into a set of moment candidates, then it does classification and regression for each candidate; ii) Bottom-up approach: It injects the whole query content into each video frame, then it predicts the probabilities of each frame as a ground truth segment boundary (i.e., start or end). Both two frameworks have respective shortcomings: the top-down models suffer from heavy computations and they are sensitive to the heuristic rules, while the performance of bottom-up models is behind the performance of top-down counterpart thus far. However, we argue that the performance of bottom-up framework is severely underestimated by current unreasonable designs, including both the backbone and head network. To this end, we design a novel bottom-up model: Graph-FPN with Dense Predictions (GDP). For the backbone, GDP firstly generates a frame feature pyramid to capture multi-level semantics, then it utilizes graph convolution to encode the plentiful scene relationships, which incidentally mitigates the semantic gaps in the multi-scale feature pyramid. For the head network, GDP regards all frames falling in the ground truth segment as the foreground, and each foreground frame regresses the unique distances from its location to bi-directional boundaries. Extensive experiments on two challenging query-based video localization tasks (natural language video localization and video relocalization), involving four challenging benchmarks (TACoS, Charades-STA, ActivityNet Captions, and Activity-VRL), have shown that GDP surpasses the state-of-the-art top-down models."
Diversity Transfer Network for Few-Shot Learning,"Few-shot learning is a challenging task that aims at training a classifier for unseen classes with only a few training examples. The main difficulty of few-shot learning lies in the lack of intra-class diversity within insufficient training samples. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel generative framework, Diversity Transfer Network (DTN), that learns to transfer latent diversities from known categories and composite them with support features to generate diverse samples for novel categories in feature space. The learning problem of the sample generation (i.e., diversity transfer) is solved via minimizing an effective meta-classification loss in a single-stage network, instead of the generative loss in previous works. Besides, an organized auxiliary task co-training over known categories is proposed to stabilize the meta-training process of DTN. We perform extensive experiments and ablation studies on three datasets, i.e., miniImageNet, CIFAR100 and CUB. The results show that DTN, with single-stage training and faster convergence speed, obtains the state-of-the-art results among the feature generation based few-shot learning methods. Code and supplementary material are available at: https://github.com/Yuxin-CV/DTN."
Structure-Aware Feature Fusion for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Unsupervised domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to learn and transfer generalized features from a labelled source domain to a target domain without any annotations. Existing methods only aligning high-level representation but without exploiting the complex multi-class structure and local spatial structure. This is problematic as 1) the model is prone to negative transfer when the features from different classes are misaligned; 2) missing the local spatial structure poses a major obstacle in performing the fine-grained feature alignment. In this paper, we integrate the valuable information conveyed in classifier prediction and local feature maps into global feature representation and then perform a single mini-max game to make it domain invariant. In this way, the domain-invariant feature not only describes the holistic representation of the original image but also preserves mode-structure and fine-grained spatial structural information. The feature integration is achieved by estimating and maximizing the mutual information (MI) among the global feature, local feature and classifier prediction simultaneously. As the MI is hard to measure directly in high-dimension spaces, we adopt a new objective function that implicitly maximizes the MI via an effective sampling strategy and a discriminator design. Our STructure-Aware Feature Fusion (STAFF) network achieves the state-of-the-art performances in various UDA datasets."
Knowledge Graph Transfer Network for Few-Shot Recognition,"Few-shot learning aims to learn novel categories from very few samples given some base categories with sufficient training samples. The main challenge of this task is the novel categories are prone to dominated by color, texture, shape of the object or background context (namely specificity), which are distinct for the given few training samples but not common for the corresponding categories (see Figure 1). Fortunately, we find that transferring information of the correlated based categories can help learn the novel concepts and thus avoid the novel concept being dominated by the specificity. Besides, incorporating semantic correlations among different categories can effectively regularize this information transfer. In this work, we represent the semantic correlations in the form of structured knowledge graph and integrate this graph into deep neural networks to promote few-shot learning by a novel Knowledge Graph Transfer Network (KGTN). Specifically, by initializing each node with the classifier weight of the corresponding category, a propagation mechanism is learned to adaptively propagate node message through the graph to explore node interaction and transfer classifier information of the base categories to those of the novel ones. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset show significant performance improvement compared with current leading competitors. Furthermore, we construct an ImageNet-6K dataset that covers larger scale categories, i.e, 6,000 categories, and experiments on this dataset further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."
Expressing Objects Just Like Words: Recurrent Visual Embedding for Image-Text Matching,"Existing image-text matching approaches typically infer the similarity of an image-text pair by capturing and aggregating the affinities between the text and each independent object of the image. However, they ignore the connections between the objects that are semantically related. These objects may collectively determine whether the image corresponds to a text or not. To address this problem, we propose a Dual Path Recurrent Neural Network (DP-RNN) which processes images and sentences symmetrically by recurrent neural networks (RNN). In particular, given an input image-text pair, our model reorders the image objects based on the positions of their most related words in the text. In the same way as extracting the hidden features from word embeddings, the model leverages RNN to extract high-level object features from the reordered object inputs. We validate that the high-level object features contain useful joint information of semantically related objects, which benefit the retrieval task. To compute the image-text similarity, we incorporate a Multi-attention Cross Matching Model into DP-RNN. It aggregates the affinity between objects and words with cross-modality guided attention and self-attention. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30K dataset and competitive performance on MS-COCO dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."
Frame-Guided Region-Aligned Representation for Video Person Re-Identification,"Pedestrians in videos are usually in a moving state, resulting in serious spatial misalignment like scale variations and pose changes, which makes the video-based person re-identification problem more challenging. To address the above issue, in this paper, we propose a Frame-Guided Region-Aligned model (FGRA) for discriminative representation learning in two steps in an end-to-end manner. Firstly, based on a frame-guided feature learning strategy and a non-parametric alignment module, a novel alignment mechanism is proposed to extract well-aligned region features. Secondly, in order to form a sequence representation, an effective feature aggregation strategy that utilizes temporal alignment score and spatial attention is adopted to fuse region features in the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to solve the misalignment problem and the superiority of the proposed method to the existing video-based person re-identification methods."
Global Context-Aware Progressive Aggregation Network for Salient Object Detection,"Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved competitive performance in salient object detection, in which how to learn effective and comprehensive features plays a critical role. Most of the previous works mainly adopted multiple-level feature integration yet ignored the gap between different features. Besides, there also exists a dilution process of high-level features as they passed on the top-down pathway. To remedy these issues, we propose a novel network named GCPANet to effectively integrate low-level appearance features, high-level semantic features, and global context features through some progressive context-aware Feature Interweaved Aggregation (FIA) modules and generate the saliency map in a supervised way. Moreover, a Head Attention (HA) module is used to reduce information redundancy and enhance the top layers features by leveraging the spatial and channel-wise attention, and the Self Refinement (SR) module is utilized to further refine and heighten the input features. Furthermore, we design the Global Context Flow (GCF) module to generate the global context information at different stages, which aims to learn the relationship among different salient regions and alleviate the dilution effect of high-level features. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively."
Video Frame Interpolation via Deformable Separable Convolution,"Learning to synthesize non-existing frames from the original consecutive video frames is a challenging task. Recent kernel-based interpolation methods predict pixels with a single convolution process to replace the dependency of optical flow. However, when scene motion is larger than the pre-defined kernel size, these methods yield poor results even though they take thousands of neighboring pixels into account. To solve this problem in this paper, we propose to use deformable separable convolution (DSepConv) to adaptively estimate kernels, offsets and masks to allow the network to obtain information with much fewer but more relevant pixels. In addition, we show that the kernel-based methods and conventional flow-based methods are specific instances of the proposed DSepConv. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the other kernel-based interpolation methods and shows strong performance on par or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithms both qualitatively and quantitatively."
CSPN++: Learning Context and Resource Aware Convolutional Spatial Propagation Networks for Depth Completion,"Depth Completion deals with the problem of converting a sparse depth map to a dense one, given the corresponding color image. Convolutional spatial propagation network (CSPN) is one of the state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods of depth completion, which recovers structural details of the scene. In this paper, we propose CSPN++, which further improves its effectiveness and efficiency by learning adaptive convolutional kernel sizes and the number of iterations for the propagation, thus the context and computational resource needed at each pixel could be dynamically assigned upon requests. Specifically, we formulate the learning of the two hyper-parameters as an architecture selection problem where various configurations of kernel sizes and numbers of iterations are first defined, and then a set of soft weighting parameters are trained to either properly assemble or select from the pre-defined configurations at each pixel. In our experiments, we find weighted assembling can lead to significant accuracy improvements, which we referred to as ""context-aware CSPN"", while weighted selection, ""resource-aware CSPN"" can reduce the computational resource significantly with similar or better accuracy. Besides, the resource needed for CSPN++ can be adjusted w.r.t. the computational budget automatically. Finally, to avoid the side effects of noise or inaccurate sparse depths, we embed a gated network inside CSPN++, which further improves the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSPN++ on the KITTI depth completion benchmark, where it significantly improves over CSPN and other SoTA methods 1."
A Coarse-to-Fine Adaptive Network for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation,"Human gaze is essential for various appealing applications. Aiming at more accurate gaze estimation, a series of recent works propose to utilize face and eye images simultaneously. Nevertheless, face and eye images only serve as independent or parallel feature sources in those works, the intrinsic correlation between their features is overlooked. In this paper we make the following contributions: 1) We propose a coarse-to-fine strategy which estimates a basic gaze direction from face image and refines it with corresponding residual predicted from eye images. 2) Guided by the proposed strategy, we design a framework which introduces a bi-gram model to bridge gaze residual and basic gaze direction, and an attention component to adaptively acquire suitable fine-grained feature. 3) Integrating the above innovations, we construct a coarse-to-fine adaptive network named CA-Net and achieve state-of-the-art performances on MPIIGaze and EyeDiap."
3D Human Pose Estimation Using Spatio-Temporal Networks with Explicit Occlusion Training,"Estimating 3D poses from a monocular video is still a challenging task, despite the significant progress that has been made in the recent years. Generally, the performance of existing methods drops when the target person is too small/large, or the motion is too fast/slow relative to the scale and speed of the training data. Moreover, to our knowledge, many of these methods are not designed or trained under severe occlusion explicitly, making their performance on handling occlusion compromised. Addressing these problems, we introduce a spatio-temporal network for robust 3D human pose estimation. As humans in videos may appear in different scales and have various motion speeds, we apply multi-scale spatial features for 2D joints or keypoints prediction in each individual frame, and multi-stride temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to estimate 3D joints or keypoints. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal discriminator based on body structures as well as limb motions to assess whether the predicted pose forms a valid pose and a valid movement. During training, we explicitly mask out some keypoints to simulate various occlusion cases, from minor to severe occlusion, so that our network can learn better and becomes robust to various degrees of occlusion. As there are limited 3D ground truth data, we further utilize 2D video data to inject a semi-supervised learning capability to our network. Experiments on public data sets validate the effectiveness of our method, and our ablation studies show the strengths of our network's individual submodules."
PedHunter: Occlusion Robust Pedestrian Detector in Crowded Scenes,"Pedestrian detection in crowded scenes is a challenging problem, because occlusion happens frequently among different pedestrians. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient detection network to hunt pedestrians in crowd scenes. The proposed method, namely PedHunter, introduces strong occlusion handling ability to existing region-based detection networks without bringing extra computations in the inference stage. Specifically, we design a mask-guided module to leverage the head information to enhance the feature representation learning of the backbone network. Moreover, we develop a strict classification criterion by improving the quality of positive samples during training to eliminate common false positives of pedestrian detection in crowded scenes. Besides, we present an occlusion-simulated data augmentation to enrich the pattern and quantity of occlusion samples to improve the occlusion robustness. As a consequent, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three pedestrian detection datasets including CityPersons, Caltech-USA and CrowdHuman. To facilitate further studies on the occluded pedestrian detection in surveillance scenes, we release a new pedestrian dataset, called SUR-PED, with a total of over 162k high-quality manually labeled instances in 10k images. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/ChiCheng123/PedHunter."
Relational Learning for Joint Head and Human Detection,"Head and human detection have been rapidly improved with the development of deep convolutional neural networks. However, these two tasks are often studied separately without considering their inherent correlation, leading to that 1) head detection is often trapped in more false positives, and 2) the performance of human detector frequently drops dramatically in crowd scenes. To handle these two issues, we present a novel joint head and human detection network, namely JointDet, which effectively detects head and human body simultaneously. Moreover, we design a head-body relationship discriminating module to perform relational learning between heads and human bodies, and leverage this learned relationship to regain the suppressed human detections and reduce head false positives. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we annotate head bounding boxes of the CityPersons and Caltech-USA datasets, and conduct extensive experiments on the CrowdHuman, CityPersons and Caltech-USA datasets. As a consequence, the proposed JointDet detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on these three benchmarks. To facilitate further studies on the head and human detection problem, all new annotations, source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/ChiCheng123/JointDet."
Visual Domain Adaptation by Consensus-Based Transfer to Intermediate Domain,"We describe an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for images by a transform to an abstract intermediate domain and ensemble classifiers seeking a consensus. The intermediate domain can be thought as a latent domain where both the source and target domains can be transferred easily. The proposed framework aligns both domains to the intermediate domain, which greatly improves the adaptation performance when the source and target domains are notably dissimilar. In addition, we propose an ensemble model trained by confusing multiple classifiers and letting them make a consensus alternately to enhance the adaptation performance for ambiguous samples. To estimate the hidden intermediate domain and the unknown labels of the target domain simultaneously, we develop a training algorithm using a double-structured architecture. We validate the proposed framework in hard adaptation scenarios with real-world datasets from simple synthetic domains to complex real-world domains. The proposed algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms on various environments."
Channel Attention Is All You Need for Video Frame Interpolation,"Prevailing video frame interpolation techniques rely heavily on optical flow estimation and require additional model complexity and computational cost; it is also susceptible to error propagation in challenging scenarios with large motion and heavy occlusion. To alleviate the limitation, we propose a simple but effective deep neural network for video frame interpolation, which is end-to-end trainable and is free from a motion estimation network component. Our algorithm employs a special feature reshaping operation, referred to as PixelShuffle, with a channel attention, which replaces the optical flow computation module. The main idea behind the design is to distribute the information in a feature map into multiple channels and extract motion information by attending the channels for pixel-level frame synthesis. The model given by this principle turns out to be effective in the presence of challenging motion and occlusion. We construct a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves outstanding performance compared to the existing models with a component for optical flow computation."
DASOT: A Unified Framework Integrating Data Association and Single Object Tracking for Online Multi-Object Tracking,"In this paper, we propose an online multi-object tracking (MOT) approach that integrates data association and single object tracking (SOT) with a unified convolutional network (ConvNet), named DASOTNet. The intuition behind integrating data association and SOT is that they can complement each other. Following Siamese network architecture, DASOTNet consists of the shared feature ConvNet, the data association branch and the SOT branch. Data association is treated as a special re-identification task and solved by learning discriminative features for different targets in the data association branch. To handle the problem that the computational cost of SOT grows intolerably as the number of tracked objects increases, we propose an efficient two-stage tracking method in the SOT branch, which utilizes the merits of correlation features and can simultaneously track all the existing targets within one forward propagation. With feature sharing and the interaction between them, data association branch and the SOT branch learn to better complement each other. Using a multi-task objective, the whole network can be trained end-to-end. Compared with state-of-the-art online MOT methods, our method is much faster while maintaining a comparable performance."
Towards Ghost-Free Shadow Removal via Dual Hierarchical Aggregation Network and Shadow Matting GAN,"Shadow removal is an essential task for scene understanding. Many studies consider only matching the image contents, which often causes two types of ghosts: color in-consistencies in shadow regions or artifacts on shadow boundaries (as shown in Figure. 1). In this paper, we tackle these issues in two ways. First, to carefully learn the border artifacts-free image, we propose a novel network structure named the dual hierarchically aggregation network (DHAN). It contains a series of growth dilated convolutions as the backbone without any down-samplings, and we hierarchically aggregate multi-context features for attention and prediction, respectively. Second, we argue that training on a limited dataset restricts the textural understanding of the network, which leads to the shadow region color in-consistencies. Currently, the largest dataset contains 2k+ shadow/shadow-free image pairs. However, it has only 0.1k+ unique scenes since many samples share exactly the same background with different shadow positions. Thus, we design a shadow matting generative adversarial network (SMGAN) to synthesize realistic shadow mattings from a given shadow mask and shadow-free image. With the help of novel masks or scenes, we enhance the current datasets using synthesized shadow images. Experiments show that our DHAN can erase the shadows and produce high-quality ghost-free images. After training on the synthesized and real datasets, our network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The code is available: http://github.com/vinthony/ghost-free-shadow-removal/"
The Missing Data Encoder: Cross-Channel Image Completion with Hide-and-Seek Adversarial Network,"Image completion is the problem of generating whole images from fragments only. It encompasses inpainting (generating a patch given its surrounding), reverse inpainting/extrapolation (generating the periphery given the central patch) as well as colorization (generating one or several channels given other ones). In this paper, we employ a deep network to perform image completion, with adversarial training as well as perceptual and completion losses, and call it the “missing data encoder” (MDE). We consider several configurations based on how the seed fragments are chosen. We show that training MDE for “random extrapolation and colorization” (MDE-REC), i.e. using random channel-independent fragments, allows a better capture of the image semantics and geometry. MDE training makes use of a novel “hide-and-seek” adversarial loss, where the discriminator seeks the original non-masked regions, while the generator tries to hide them. We validate our models qualitatively and quantitatively on several datasets, showing their interest for image completion, representation learning as well as face occlusion handling."
Spatio-Temporal Deformable Convolution for Compressed Video Quality Enhancement,"Recent years have witnessed remarkable success of deep learning methods in quality enhancement for compressed video. To better explore temporal information, existing methods usually estimate optical flow for temporal motion compensation. However, since compressed video could be seriously distorted by various compression artifacts, the estimated optical flow tends to be inaccurate and unreliable, thereby resulting in ineffective quality enhancement. In addition, optical flow estimation for consecutive frames is generally conducted in a pairwise manner, which is computational expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a fast yet effective method for compressed video quality enhancement by incorporating a novel Spatio-Temporal Deformable Fusion (STDF) scheme to aggregate temporal information. Specifically, the proposed STDF takes a target frame along with its neighboring reference frames as input to jointly predict an offset field to deform the spatio-temporal sampling positions of convolution. As a result, complementary information from both target and reference frames can be fused within a single Spatio-Temporal Deformable Convolution (STDC) operation. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance of compressed video quality enhancement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency."
Zero Shot Learning with the Isoperimetric Loss,"We introduce the isoperimetric loss as a regularization criterion for learning the map from a visual representation to a semantic embedding, to be used to transfer knowledge to unknown classes in a zero-shot learning setting. We use a pre-trained deep neural network model as a visual representation of image data, a Word2Vec embedding of class labels, and linear maps between the visual and semantic embedding spaces. However, the spaces themselves are not linear, and we postulate the sample embedding to be populated by noisy samples near otherwise smooth manifolds. We exploit the graph structure defined by the sample points to regularize the estimates of the manifolds by inferring the graph connectivity using a generalization of the isoperimetric inequalities from Riemannian geometry to graphs. Surprisingly, this regularization alone, paired with the simplest baseline model, outperforms the state-of-the-art among fully automated methods in zero-shot learning benchmarks such as AwA and CUB. This improvement is achieved solely by learning the structure of the underlying spaces by imposing regularity."
Every Frame Counts: Joint Learning of Video Segmentation and Optical Flow,"A major challenge for video semantic segmentation is the lack of labeled data. In most benchmark datasets, only one frame of a video clip is annotated, which makes most supervised methods fail to utilize information from the rest of the frames. To exploit the spatio-temporal information in videos, many previous works use pre-computed optical flows, which encode the temporal consistency to improve the video segmentation. However, the video segmentation and optical flow estimation are still considered as two separate tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for joint video semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation. Semantic segmentation brings semantic information to handle occlusion for more robust optical flow estimation, while the non-occluded optical flow provides accurate pixel-level temporal correspondences to guarantee the temporal consistency of the segmentation. Moreover, our framework is able to utilize both labeled and unlabeled frames in the video through joint training, while no additional calculation is required in inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model makes the video semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation benefit from each other and outperforms existing methods under the same settings in both tasks."
Cycle-CNN for Colorization towards Real Monochrome-Color Camera Systems,"Colorization in monochrome-color camera systems aims to colorize the gray image IG from the monochrome camera using the color image RC from the color camera as reference. Since monochrome cameras have better imaging quality than color cameras, the colorization can help obtain higher quality color images. Related learning based methods usually simulate the monochrome-color camera systems to generate the synthesized data for training, due to the lack of ground-truth color information of the gray image in the real data. However, the methods that are trained relying on the synthesized data may get poor results when colorizing real data, because the synthesized data may deviate from the real data. We present a new CNN model, named cycle CNN, which can directly use the real data from monochrome-color camera systems for training. In detail, we use the colorization CNN model to do the colorization twice. First, we colorize IG using RC as reference to obtain the first-time colorization result IC. Second, we colorize the de-colored map of RC, i.e. RG, using the first-time colorization result IC as reference to obtain the second-time colorization result R′C. In this way, for the second-time colorization result R′C, we use the original color map RC as ground-truth and introduce the cycle consistency loss to push R′C ≈ RC. Also, for the first-time colorization result IC, we propose a structure similarity loss to encourage the luminance maps between IG and IC to have similar structures. In addition, we introduce a spatial smoothness loss within the colorization CNN model to encourage spatial smoothness of the colorization result. Combining all these losses, we could train the colorization CNN model using the real data in the absence of the ground-truth color information of IG. Experimental results show that we can outperform related methods largely for colorizing real data."
FD-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks with Fusion-Discriminator for Single Image Dehazing,"Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great improvements in single image dehazing and attained much attention in research. Most existing learning-based dehazing methods are not fully end-to-end, which still follow the traditional dehazing procedure: first estimate the medium transmission and the atmospheric light, then recover the haze-free image based on the atmospheric scattering model. However, in practice, due to lack of priors and constraints, it is hard to precisely estimate these intermediate parameters. Inaccurate estimation further degrades the performance of dehazing, resulting in artifacts, color distortion and insufficient haze removal. To address this, we propose a fully end-to-end Generative Adversarial Networks with Fusion-discriminator (FD-GAN) for image dehazing. With the proposed Fusion-discriminator which takes frequency information as additional priors, our model can generator more natural and realistic dehazed images with less color distortion and fewer artifacts. Moreover, we synthesize a large-scale training dataset including various indoor and outdoor hazy images to boost the performance and we reveal that for learning-based dehazing methods, the performance is strictly influenced by the training data. Experiments have shown that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance on both public synthetic datasets and real-world images with more visually pleasing dehazed results."
Visual Relationship Detection with Low Rank Non-Negative Tensor Decomposition,"We address the problem of Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) which aims to describe the relationships between pairs of objects in the form of triplets of (subject, predicate, object). We observe that given a pair of bounding box proposals, objects often participate in multiple relations implying the distribution of triplets is multimodal. We leverage the strong correlations within triplets to learn the joint distribution of triplet variables conditioned on the image and the bounding box proposals, doing away with the hitherto used independent distribution of triplets. To make learning the triplet joint distribution feasible, we introduce a novel technique of learning conditional triplet distributions in the form of their normalized low rank non-negative tensor decompositions. Normalized tensor decompositions take form of mixture distributions of discrete variables and thus are able to capture multimodality. This allows us to efficiently learn higher order discrete multimodal distributions and at the same time keep the parameter size manageable. We further model the probability of selecting an object proposal pair and include a relation triplet prior in our model. We show that each part of the model improves performance and the combination outperforms state-of-the-art score on the Visual Genome (VG) and Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) datasets."
SubSpace Capsule Network,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a key asset to most of fields in AI. Despite their successful performance, CNNs suffer from a major drawback. They fail to capture the hierarchy of spatial relation among different parts of an entity. As a remedy to this problem, the idea of capsules was proposed by Hinton. In this paper, we propose the SubSpace Capsule Network (SCN) that exploits the idea of capsule networks to model possible variations in the appearance or implicitly-defined properties of an entity through a group of capsule subspaces instead of simply grouping neurons to create capsules. A capsule is created by projecting an input feature vector from a lower layer onto the capsule subspace using a learnable transformation. This transformation finds the degree of alignment of the input with the properties modeled by the capsule subspace.We show that SCN is a general capsule network that can successfully be applied to both discriminative and generative models without incurring computational overhead compared to CNN during test time. Effectiveness of SCN is evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments on supervised image classification, semi-supervised image classification and high-resolution image generation tasks using the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. SCN significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in all 3 tasks."
Person Tube Retrieval via Language Description,"This paper focuses on the problem of person tube (a sequence of bounding boxes which encloses a person in a video) retrieval using a natural language query. Different from images in person re-identification (re-ID) or person search, besides appearance, person tube contains abundant action and information. We exploit a 2D and a 3D residual networks (ResNets) to extract the appearance and action representation, respectively. To transform tubes and descriptions into a shared latent space where data from the two different modalities can be compared directly, we propose a Multi-Scale Structure Preservation (MSSP) approach. MSSP splits a person tube into several element-tubes on average, whose features are extracted by the two ResNets. Any number of consecutive element-tubes forms a sub-tube. MSSP considers the following constraints for sub-tubes and descriptions in the shared space. 1) Bidirectional ranking. Matching sub-tubes (resp. descriptions) should get ranked higher than incorrect ones for each description (resp. sub-tube). 2) External structure preservation. Sub-tubes (resp. descriptions) from different persons should stay away from each other. 3) Internal structure preservation. Sub-tubes (resp. descriptions) from the same person should be close to each other. Experimental results on person tube retrieval via language description and other two related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of MSSP."
CIAN: Cross-Image Affinity Net for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation with only image-level labels saves large human effort to annotate pixel-level labels. Cutting-edge approaches rely on various innovative constraints and heuristic rules to generate the masks for every single image. Although great progress has been achieved by these methods, they treat each image independently and do not take account of the relationships across different images. In this paper, however, we argue that the cross-image relationship is vital for weakly supervised segmentation. Because it connects related regions across images, where supplementary representations can be propagated to obtain more consistent and integral regions. To leverage this information, we propose an end-to-end cross-image affinity module, which exploits pixel-level cross-image relationships with only image-level labels. By means of this, our approach achieves 64.3% and 65.3% mIoU on Pascal VOC 2012 validation and test set respectively, which is a new state-of-the-art result by only using image-level labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, demonstrating the superiority of our approach."
Scale-Wise Convolution for Image Restoration,"While scale-invariant modeling has substantially boosted the performance of visual recognition tasks, it remains largely under-explored in deep networks based image restoration. Naively applying those scale-invariant techniques (e.g., multi-scale testing, random-scale data augmentation) to image restoration tasks usually leads to inferior performance. In this paper, we show that properly modeling scale-invariance into neural networks can bring significant benefits to image restoration performance. Inspired from spatial-wise convolution for shift-invariance, “scale-wise convolution” is proposed to convolve across multiple scales for scale-invariance. In our scale-wise convolutional network (SCN), we first map the input image to the feature space and then build a feature pyramid representation via bi-linear down-scaling progressively. The feature pyramid is then passed to a residual network with scale-wise convolutions. The proposed scale-wise convolution learns to dynamically activate and aggregate features from different input scales in each residual building block, in order to exploit contextual information on multiple scales. In experiments, we compare the restoration accuracy and parameter efficiency among our model and many different variants of multi-scale neural networks. The proposed network with scale-wise convolution achieves superior performance in multiple image restoration tasks including image super-resolution, image denoising and image compression artifacts removal. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/ychfan/scn_sr."
EHSOD: CAM-Guided End-to-End Hybrid-Supervised Object Detection with Cascade Refinement,"Object detectors trained on fully-annotated data currently yield state of the art performance but require expensive manual annotations. On the other hand, weakly-supervised detectors have much lower performance and cannot be used reliably in a realistic setting. In this paper, we study the hybrid-supervised object detection problem, aiming to train a high quality detector with only a limited amount of fully-annotated data and fully exploiting cheap data with image-level labels. State of the art methods typically propose an iterative approach, alternating between generating pseudo-labels and updating a detector. This paradigm requires careful manual hyper-parameter tuning for mining good pseudo labels at each round and is quite time-consuming. To address these issues, we present EHSOD, an end-to-end hybrid-supervised object detection system which can be trained in one shot on both fully and weakly-annotated data. Specifically, based on a two-stage detector, we proposed two modules to fully utilize the information from both kinds of labels: 1) CAM-RPN module aims at finding foreground proposals guided by a class activation heat-map; 2) hybrid-supervised cascade module further refines the bounding-box position and classification with the help of an auxiliary head compatible with image-level data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and it achieves comparable results on multiple object detection benchmarks with only 30% fully-annotated data, e.g. 37.5% mAP on COCO. We will release the code and the trained models."
Adversarial Attack on Deep Product Quantization Network for Image Retrieval,"Deep product quantization network (DPQN) has recently received much attention in fast image retrieval tasks due to its efficiency of encoding high-dimensional visual features especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to input with small and maliciously designed perturbations (a.k.a., adversarial examples). This phenomenon raises the concern of security issues for DPQN in the testing/deploying stage as well. However, little effort has been devoted to investigating how adversarial examples affect DPQN. To this end, we propose product quantization adversarial generation (PQ-AG), a simple yet effective method to generate adversarial examples for product quantization based retrieval systems. PQ-AG aims to generate imperceptible adversarial perturbations for query images to form adversarial queries, whose nearest neighbors from a targeted product quantizaiton model are not semantically related to those from the original queries. Extensive experiments show that our PQ-AQ successfully creates adversarial examples to mislead targeted product quantization retrieval models. Besides, we found that our PQ-AG significantly degrades retrieval performance in both white-box and black-box settings."
Dynamic Sampling Network for Semantic Segmentation,"Sampling is a basic operation of modern convolutional neural networks (CNN) since down-sampling operators are employed to enlarge the receptive field while up-sampling operators are adopted to increase resolution. Most existing deep segmentation networks employ regular grid sampling operators, which can be suboptimal for semantic segmentation task due to large shape and scale variance. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Context Guided Dynamic Sampling (CGDS) module to obtain an effective representation with rich shape and scale information by adaptively sampling useful segmentation information in spatial space. Moreover, we utilize the multi-scale contextual representations to guide the sampling process. Therefore, our CGDS can adaptively capture shape and scale information according to not only the input feature map but also the multi-scale semantic context. CGDS provides a plug-and-play module which can be easily incorporated in deep segmentation networks. We incorporate our proposed CGDS module into Dynamic Sampling Network (DSNet) and perform extensive experiments on segmentation datasets. Experimental results show that our CGDS significantly improves semantic segmentation performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets. Our model achieves 85.2% mIOU on PASCAL VOC 2012 test set without MS COCO dataset pre-trained and 46.4% on ADE20K validation set. The codes will become publicly available after publication."
Ultrafast Video Attention Prediction with Coupled Knowledge Distillation,"Large convolutional neural network models have recently demonstrated impressive performance on video attention prediction. Conventionally, these models are with intensive computation and large memory. To address these issues, we design an extremely light-weight network with ultrafast speed, named UVA-Net. The network is constructed based on depth-wise convolutions and takes low-resolution images as input. However, this straight-forward acceleration method will decrease performance dramatically. To this end, we propose a coupled knowledge distillation strategy to augment and train the network effectively. With this strategy, the model can further automatically discover and emphasize implicit useful cues contained in the data. Both spatial and temporal knowledge learned by the high-resolution complex teacher networks also can be distilled and transferred into the proposed low-resolution light-weight spatiotemporal network. Experimental results show that the performance of our model is comparable to 11 state-of-the-art models in video attention prediction, while it costs only 0.68 MB memory footprint, runs about 10,106 FPS on GPU and 404 FPS on CPU, which is 206 times faster than previous models."
Accurate Temporal Action Proposal Generation with Relation-Aware Pyramid Network,"Accurate temporal action proposals play an important role in detecting actions from untrimmed videos. The existing approaches have difficulties in capturing global contextual information and simultaneously localizing actions with different durations. To this end, we propose a Relation-aware pyramid Network (RapNet) to generate highly accurate temporal action proposals. In RapNet, a novel relation-aware module is introduced to exploit bi-directional long-range relations between local features for context distilling. This embedded module enhances the RapNet in terms of its multi-granularity temporal proposal generation ability, given predefined anchor boxes. We further introduce a two-stage adjustment scheme to refine the proposal boundaries and measure their confidence in containing an action with snippet-level actionness. Extensive experiments on the challenging ActivityNet and THUMOS14 benchmarks demonstrate our RapNet generates superior accurate proposals over the existing state-of-the-art methods."
Channel Interaction Networks for Fine-Grained Image Categorization,"Fine-grained image categorization is challenging due to the subtle inter-class differences. We posit that exploiting the rich relationships between channels can help capture such differences since different channels correspond to different semantics. In this paper, we propose a channel interaction network (CIN), which models the channel-wise interplay both within an image and across images. For a single image, a self-channel interaction (SCI) module is proposed to explore channel-wise correlation within the image. This allows the model to learn the complementary features from the correlated channels, yielding stronger fine-grained features. Furthermore, given an image pair, we introduce a contrastive channel interaction (CCI) module to model the cross-sample channel interaction with a metric learning framework, allowing the CIN to distinguish the subtle visual differences between images. Our model can be trained efficiently in an end-to-end fashion without the need of multi-stage training and testing. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available benchmarks, where the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, such as DFL-CNN(Wang, Morariu, and Davis 2018) and NTS(Yang et al. 2018)."
KnowIT VQA: Answering Knowledge-Based Questions about Videos,"We propose a novel video understanding task by fusing knowledge-based and video question answering. First, we introduce KnowIT VQA, a video dataset with 24,282 human-generated question-answer pairs about a popular sitcom. The dataset combines visual, textual and temporal coherence reasoning together with knowledge-based questions, which need of the experience obtained from the viewing of the series to be answered. Second, we propose a video understanding model by combining the visual and textual video content with specific knowledge about the show. Our main findings are: (i) the incorporation of knowledge produces outstanding improvements for VQA in video, and (ii) the performance on KnowIT VQA still lags well behind human accuracy, indicating its usefulness for studying current video modelling limitations."
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Active Human Pose Estimation,"Most 3d human pose estimation methods assume that input – be it images of a scene collected from one or several viewpoints, or from a video – is given. Consequently, they focus on estimates leveraging prior knowledge and measurement by fusing information spatially and/or temporally, whenever available. In this paper we address the problem of an active observer with freedom to move and explore the scene spatially – in ‘time-freeze’ mode – and/or temporally, by selecting informative viewpoints that improve its estimation accuracy. Towards this end, we introduce Pose-DRL, a fully trainable deep reinforcement learning-based active pose estimation architecture which learns to select appropriate views, in space and time, to feed an underlying monocular pose estimator. We evaluate our model using single- and multi-target estimators with strong result in both settings. Our system further learns automatic stopping conditions in time and transition functions to the next temporal processing step in videos. In extensive experiments with the Panoptic multi-view setup, and for complex scenes containing multiple people, we show that our model learns to select viewpoints that yield significantly more accurate pose estimates compared to strong multi-view baselines."
Look One and More: Distilling Hybrid Order Relational Knowledge for Cross-Resolution Image Recognition,"In spite of great success in many image recognition tasks achieved by recent deep models, directly applying them to recognize low-resolution images may suffer from low accuracy due to the missing of informative details during resolution degradation. However, these images are still recognizable for subjects who are familiar with the corresponding high-resolution ones. Inspired by that, we propose a teacher-student learning approach to facilitate low-resolution image recognition via hybrid order relational knowledge distillation. The approach refers to three streams: the teacher stream is pretrained to recognize high-resolution images in high accuracy, the student stream is learned to identify low-resolution images by mimicking the teacher's behaviors, and the extra assistant stream is introduced as bridge to help knowledge transfer across the teacher to the student. To extract sufficient knowledge for reducing the loss in accuracy, the learning of student is supervised with multiple losses, which preserves the similarities in various order relational structures. In this way, the capability of recovering missing details of familiar low-resolution images can be effectively enhanced, leading to a better knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on metric learning, low-resolution image classification and low-resolution face recognition tasks show the effectiveness of our approach, while taking reduced models."
Symmetrical Synthesis for Deep Metric Learning,"Deep metric learning aims to learn embeddings that contain semantic similarity information among data points. To learn better embeddings, methods to generate synthetic hard samples have been proposed. Existing methods of synthetic hard sample generation are adopting autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, but this leads to more hyper-parameters, harder optimization, and slower training speed. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a novel method of synthetic hard sample generation called symmetrical synthesis. Given two original feature points from the same class, the proposed method firstly generates synthetic points with each other as an axis of symmetry. Secondly, it performs hard negative pair mining within the original and synthetic points to select a more informative negative pair for computing the metric learning loss. Our proposed method is hyper-parameter free and plug-and-play for existing metric learning losses without network modification. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing methods for a variety of loss functions on clustering and image retrieval tasks."
FLNet: Landmark Driven Fetching and Learning Network for Faithful Talking Facial Animation Synthesis,"Talking face synthesis has been widely studied in either appearance-based or warping-based methods. Previous works mostly utilize single face image as a source, and generate novel facial animations by merging other person's facial features. However, some facial regions like eyes or teeth, which may be hidden in the source image, can not be synthesized faithfully and stably. In this paper, We present a landmark driven two-stream network to generate faithful talking facial animation, in which more facial details are created, preserved and transferred from multiple source images instead of a single one. Specifically, we propose a network consisting of a learning and fetching stream. The fetching sub-net directly learns to attentively warp and merge facial regions from five source images of distinctive landmarks, while the learning pipeline renders facial organs from the training face space to compensate. Compared to baseline algorithms, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a higher performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Codes are at https://github.com/kgu3/FLNet_AAAI2020."
Pyramid Constrained Self-Attention Network for Fast Video Salient Object Detection,"Spatiotemporal information is essential for video salient object detection (VSOD) due to the highly attractive object motion for human's attention. Previous VSOD methods usually use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or 3D ConvNet (C3D), which can only encode motion information through step-by-step propagation in the temporal domain. Recently, the non-local mechanism is proposed to capture long-range dependencies directly. However, it is not straightforward to apply the non-local mechanism into VSOD, because i) it fails to capture motion cues and tends to learn motion-independent global contexts; ii) its computation and memory costs are prohibitive for video dense prediction tasks such as VSOD. To address the above problems, we design a Constrained Self-Attention (CSA) operation to capture motion cues, based on the prior that objects always move in a continuous trajectory. We group a set of CSA operations in Pyramid structures (PCSA) to capture objects at various scales and speeds. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed (110 FPS on a single Titan Xp) on five challenge datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/guyuchao/PyramidCSA."
Constructing Multiple Tasks for Augmentation: Improving Neural Image Classification with K-Means Features,"Multi-task learning (MTL) has received considerable attention, and numerous deep learning applications benefit from MTL with multiple objectives. However, constructing multiple related tasks is difficult, and sometimes only a single task is available for training in a dataset. To tackle this problem, we explored the idea of using unsupervised clustering to construct a variety of auxiliary tasks from unlabeled data or existing labeled data. We found that some of these newly constructed tasks could exhibit semantic meanings corresponding to certain human-specific attributes, but some were non-ideal. In order to effectively reduce the impact of non-ideal auxiliary tasks on the main task, we further proposed a novel meta-learning-based multi-task learning approach, which trained the shared hidden layers on auxiliary tasks, while the meta-optimization objective was to minimize the loss on the main task, ensuring that the optimizing direction led to an improvement on the main task. Experimental results across five image datasets demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed existing single task learning, semi-supervised learning, and some data augmentation methods, including an improvement of more than 9% on the Omniglot dataset."
Channel Pruning Guided by Classification Loss and Feature Importance,"In this work, we propose a new layer-by-layer channel pruning method called Channel Pruning guided by classification Loss and feature Importance (CPLI). In contrast to the existing layer-by-layer channel pruning approaches that only consider how to reconstruct the features from the next layer, our approach additionally take the classification loss into account in the channel pruning process. We also observe that some reconstructed features will be removed at the next pruning stage. So it is unnecessary to reconstruct these features. To this end, we propose a new strategy to suppress the influence of unimportant features (i.e., the features will be removed at the next pruning stage). Our comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and UCF-101, demonstrate the effectiveness of our CPLI method."
MarioNETte: Few-Shot Face Reenactment Preserving Identity of Unseen Targets,"When there is a mismatch between the target identity and the driver identity, face reenactment suffers severe degradation in the quality of the result, especially in a few-shot setting. The identity preservation problem, where the model loses the detailed information of the target leading to a defective output, is the most common failure mode. The problem has several potential sources such as the identity of the driver leaking due to the identity mismatch, or dealing with unseen large poses. To overcome such problems, we introduce components that address the mentioned problem: image attention block, target feature alignment, and landmark transformer. Through attending and warping the relevant features, the proposed architecture, called MarioNETte, produces high-quality reenactments of unseen identities in a few-shot setting. In addition, the landmark transformer dramatically alleviates the identity preservation problem by isolating the expression geometry through landmark disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments are performed to verify that the proposed framework can generate highly realistic faces, outperforming all other baselines, even under a significant mismatch of facial characteristics between the target and the driver."
SADA: Semantic Adversarial Diagnostic Attacks for Autonomous Applications,"One major factor impeding more widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their lack of robustness, which is essential for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. This has motivated much recent work on adversarial attacks for DNNs, which mostly focus on pixel-level perturbations void of semantic meaning. In contrast, we present a general framework for adversarial attacks on trained agents, which covers semantic perturbations to the environment of the agent performing the task as well as pixel-level attacks. To do this, we re-frame the adversarial attack problem as learning a distribution of parameters that always fools the agent. In the semantic case, our proposed adversary (denoted as BBGAN) is trained to sample parameters that describe the environment with which the black-box agent interacts, such that the agent performs its dedicated task poorly in this environment. We apply BBGAN on three different tasks, primarily targeting aspects of autonomous navigation: object detection, self-driving, and autonomous UAV racing. On these tasks, BBGAN can generate failure cases that consistently fool a trained agent."
Robust Conditional GAN from Uncertainty-Aware Pairwise Comparisons,"Conditional generative adversarial networks have shown exceptional generation performance over the past few years. However, they require large numbers of annotations. To address this problem, we propose a novel generative adversarial network utilizing weak supervision in the form of pairwise comparisons (PC-GAN) for image attribute editing. In the light of Bayesian uncertainty estimation and noise-tolerant adversarial training, PC-GAN can estimate attribute rating efficiently and demonstrate robust performance in noise resistance. Through extensive experiments, we show both qualitatively and quantitatively that PC-GAN performs comparably with fully-supervised methods and outperforms unsupervised baselines. Code and Supplementary can be found on the project website*."
Complementary-View Multiple Human Tracking,"The global trajectories of targets on ground can be well captured from a top view in a high altitude, e.g., by a drone-mounted camera, while their local detailed appearances can be better recorded from horizontal views, e.g., by a helmet camera worn by a person. This paper studies a new problem of multiple human tracking from a pair of top- and horizontal-view videos taken at the same time. Our goal is to track the humans in both views and identify the same person across the two complementary views frame by frame, which is very challenging due to very large field of view difference. In this paper, we model the data similarity in each view using appearance and motion reasoning and across views using appearance and spatial reasoning. Combing them, we formulate the proposed multiple human tracking as a joint optimization problem, which can be solved by constrained integer programming. We collect a new dataset consisting of top- and horizontal-view video pairs for performance evaluation and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Point2Node: Correlation Learning of Dynamic-Node for Point Cloud Feature Modeling,"Fully exploring correlation among points in point clouds is essential for their feature modeling. This paper presents a novel end-to-end graph model, named Point2Node, to represent a given point cloud. Point2Node can dynamically explore correlation among all graph nodes from different levels, and adaptively aggregate the learned features. Specifically, first, to fully explore the spatial correlation among points for enhanced feature description, in a high-dimensional node graph, we dynamically integrate the node's correlation with self, local, and non-local nodes. Second, to more effectively integrate learned features, we design a data-aware gate mechanism to self-adaptively aggregate features at the channel level. Extensive experiments on various point cloud benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art."
Tensor FISTA-Net for Real-Time Snapshot Compressive Imaging,"Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) cameras capture high-speed videos by compressing multiple video frames into a measurement frame. However, reconstructing video frames from the compressed measurement frame is challenging. The existing state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms suffer from low reconstruction quality or heavy time consumption, making them not suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, exploiting the powerful learning ability of deep neural networks (DNN), we propose a novel Tensor Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm Net (Tensor FISTA-Net) as a decoder for SCI video cameras. Tensor FISTA-Net not only learns the sparsest representation of the video frames through convolution layers, but also reduces the reconstruction time significantly through tensor calculations. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that the proposed Tensor FISTA-Net achieves average PSNR improvement of 1.63∼3.89dB over the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, Tensor FISTA-Net takes less than 2 seconds running time and 12MB memory footprint, making it practical for real-time IoT applications."
Temporal Context Enhanced Feature Aggregation for Video Object Detection,"Video object detection is a challenging task because of the presence of appearance deterioration in certain video frames. One typical solution is to aggregate neighboring features to enhance per-frame appearance features. However, such a method ignores the temporal relations between the aggregated frames, which is critical for improving video recognition accuracy. To handle the appearance deterioration problem, this paper proposes a temporal context enhanced network (TCENet) to exploit temporal context information by temporal aggregation for video object detection. To handle the displacement of the objects in videos, a novel DeformAlign module is proposed to align the spatial features from frame to frame. Instead of adopting a fixed-length window fusion strategy, a temporal stride predictor is proposed to adaptively select video frames for aggregation, which facilitates exploiting variable temporal information and requiring fewer video frames for aggregation to achieve better results. Our TCENet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet VID dataset and has a faster runtime. Without bells-and-whistles, our TCENet achieves 80.3% mAP by only aggregating 3 frames."
Grapy-ML: Graph Pyramid Mutual Learning for Cross-Dataset Human Parsing,"Human parsing, or human body part semantic segmentation, has been an active research topic due to its wide potential applications. In this paper, we propose a novel GRAph PYramid Mutual Learning (Grapy-ML) method to address the cross-dataset human parsing problem, where the annotations are at different granularities. Starting from the prior knowledge of the human body hierarchical structure, we devise a graph pyramid module (GPM) by stacking three levels of graph structures from coarse granularity to fine granularity subsequently. At each level, GPM utilizes the self-attention mechanism to model the correlations between context nodes. Then, it adopts a top-down mechanism to progressively refine the hierarchical features through all the levels. GPM also enables efficient mutual learning. Specifically, the network weights of the first two levels are shared to exchange the learned coarse-granularity information across different datasets. By making use of the multi-granularity labels, Grapy-ML learns a more discriminative feature representation and achieves state-of-the-art performance, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments on the three popular benchmarks, e.g. CIHP dataset. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Charleshhy/Grapy-ML."
Softmax Dissection: Towards Understanding Intra- and Inter-Class Objective for Embedding Learning,"The softmax loss and its variants are widely used as objectives for embedding learning applications like face recognition. However, the intra- and inter-class objectives in Softmax are entangled, therefore a well-optimized inter-class objective leads to relaxation on the intra-class objective, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose to dissect Softmax into independent intra- and inter-class objective (D-Softmax) with a clear understanding. It is straightforward to tune each part to the best state with D-Softmax as objective.Furthermore, we find the computation of the inter-class part is redundant and propose sampling-based variants of D-Softmax to reduce the computation cost. The face recognition experiments on regular-scale data show D-Softmax is favorably comparable to existing losses such as SphereFace and ArcFace. Experiments on massive-scale data show the fast variants significantly accelerates the training process (such as 64×) with only a minor sacrifice in performance, outperforming existing acceleration methods of Softmax in terms of both performance and efficiency."
RoadTagger: Robust Road Attribute Inference with Graph Neural Networks,"Inferring road attributes such as lane count and road type from satellite imagery is challenging. Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation – the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers.To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. Using a GNN allows information to propagate on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. In addition, RoadTagger is robust to disruptions in the satellite imagery and is able to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network."
Joint Commonsense and Relation Reasoning for Image and Video Captioning,"Exploiting relationships between objects for image and video captioning has received increasing attention. Most existing methods depend heavily on pre-trained detectors of objects and their relationships, and thus may not work well when facing detection challenges such as heavy occlusion, tiny-size objects, and long-tail classes. In this paper, we propose a joint commonsense and relation reasoning method that exploits prior knowledge for image and video captioning without relying on any detectors. The prior knowledge provides semantic correlations and constraints between objects, serving as guidance to build semantic graphs that summarize object relationships, some of which cannot be directly perceived from images or videos. Particularly, our method is implemented by an iterative learning algorithm that alternates between 1) commonsense reasoning for embedding visual regions into the semantic space to build a semantic graph and 2) relation reasoning for encoding semantic graphs to generate sentences. Experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our prior knowledge-based approach."
Hierarchical Modes Exploring in Generative Adversarial Networks,"In conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), when two different initial noises are concatenated with the same conditional information, the distance between their outputs is relatively smaller, which makes minor modes likely to collapse into large modes. To prevent this happen, we proposed a hierarchical mode exploring method to alleviate mode collapse in cGANs by introducing a diversity measurement into the objective function as the regularization term. We also introduced the Expected Ratios of Expansion (ERE) into the regularization term, by minimizing the sum of differences between the real change of distance and ERE, we can control the diversity of generated images w.r.t specific-level features. We validated the proposed algorithm on four conditional image synthesis tasks including categorical generation, paired and un-paired image translation and text-to-image generation. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed method is effective in alleviating the mode collapse problem in cGANs, and can control the diversity of output images w.r.t specific-level features."
SPSTracker: Sub-Peak Suppression of Response Map for Robust Object Tracking,"Modern visual trackers usually construct online learning models under the assumption that the feature response has a Gaussian distribution with target-centered peak response. Nevertheless, such an assumption is implausible when there is progressive interference from other targets and/or background noise, which produce sub-peaks on the tracking response map and cause model drift. In this paper, we propose a rectified online learning approach for sub-peak response suppression and peak response enforcement and target at handling progressive interference in a systematic way. Our approach, referred to as SPSTracker, applies simple-yet-efficient Peak Response Pooling (PRP) to aggregate and align discriminative features, as well as leveraging a Boundary Response Truncation (BRT) to reduce the variance of feature response. By fusing with multi-scale features, SPSTracker aggregates the response distribution of multiple sub-peaks to a single maximum peak, which enforces the discriminative capability of features for robust object tracking. Experiments on the OTB, NFS and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that SPSTrack outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time trackers with significant margins1"
3D Shape Completion with Multi-View Consistent Inference,"3D shape completion is important to enable machines to perceive the complete geometry of objects from partial observations. To address this problem, view-based methods have been presented. These methods represent shapes as multiple depth images, which can be back-projected to yield corresponding 3D point clouds, and they perform shape completion by learning to complete each depth image using neural networks. While view-based methods lead to state-of-the-art results, they currently do not enforce geometric consistency among the completed views during the inference stage. To resolve this issue, we propose a multi-view consistent inference technique for 3D shape completion, which we express as an energy minimization problem including a data term and a regularization term. We formulate the regularization term as a consistency loss that encourages geometric consistency among multiple views, while the data term guarantees that the optimized views do not drift away too much from a learned shape descriptor. Experimental results demonstrate that our method completes shapes more accurately than previous techniques."
GTC: Guided Training of CTC towards Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Recognition,"Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and attention mechanism are two main approaches used in recent scene text recognition works. Compared with attention-based methods, CTC decoder has a much shorter inference time, yet a lower accuracy. To design an efficient and effective model, we propose the guided training of CTC (GTC), where CTC model learns a better alignment and feature representations from a more powerful attentional guidance. With the benefit of guided training, CTC model achieves robust and accurate prediction for both regular and irregular scene text while maintaining a fast inference speed. Moreover, to further leverage the potential of CTC decoder, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed to learn the local correlations of extracted features. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our end-to-end model achieves a new state-of-the-art for regular and irregular scene text recognition and needs 6 times shorter inference time than attention-based methods."
Coarse-to-Fine Hyper-Prior Modeling for Learned Image Compression,"Approaches to image compression with machine learning now achieve superior performance on the compression rate compared to existing hybrid codecs. The conventional learning-based methods for image compression exploits hyper-prior and spatial context model to facilitate probability estimations. Such models have limitations in modeling long-term dependency and do not fully squeeze out the spatial redundancy in images. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework with hierarchical layers of hyper-priors to conduct comprehensive analysis of the image and more effectively reduce spatial redundancy, which improves the rate-distortion performance of image compression significantly. Signal Preserving Hyper Transforms are designed to achieve an in-depth analysis of the latent representation and the Information Aggregation Reconstruction sub-network is proposed to maximally utilize side-information for reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed network to efficiently reduce the redundancies in images and improve the rate-distortion performance, especially for high-resolution images. Our project is publicly available at https://huzi96.github.io/coarse-to-fine-compression.html."
Location-Aware Graph Convolutional Networks for Video Question Answering,"We addressed the challenging task of video question answering, which requires machines to answer questions about videos in a natural language form. Previous state-of-the-art methods attempt to apply spatio-temporal attention mechanism on video frame features without explicitly modeling the location and relations among object interaction occurred in videos. However, the relations between object interaction and their location information are very critical for both action recognition and question reasoning. In this work, we propose to represent the contents in the video as a location-aware graph by incorporating the location information of an object into the graph construction. Here, each node is associated with an object represented by its appearance and location features. Based on the constructed graph, we propose to use graph convolution to infer both the category and temporal locations of an action. As the graph is built on objects, our method is able to focus on the foreground action contents for better video question answering. Lastly, we leverage an attention mechanism to combine the output of graph convolution and encoded question features for final answer reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Specifically, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TGIF-QA, Youtube2Text-QA and MSVD-QA datasets."
Unsupervised Deep Learning via Affinity Diffusion,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in a variety of computer vision tasks. However, they usually rely on supervised model learning with the need for massive labelled training data, limiting dramatically their usability and deployability in real-world scenarios without any labelling budget. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose unsupervised deep learning approach to deriving discriminative feature representations. It is based on self-discovering semantically consistent groups of unlabelled training samples with the same class concepts through a progressive affinity diffusion process. Extensive experiments on object image classification and clustering show the performance superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning models using six common image recognition benchmarks including MNIST, SVHN, STL10, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet."
GlobalTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for Long-Term Tracking,"A key capability of a long-term tracker is to search for targets in very large areas (typically the entire image) to handle possible target absences or tracking failures. However, currently there is a lack of such a strong baseline for global instance search. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap. Specifically, we propose GlobalTrack, a pure global instance search based tracker that makes no assumption on the temporal consistency of the target's positions and scales. GlobalTrack is developed based on two-stage object detectors, and it is able to perform full-image and multi-scale search of arbitrary instances with only a single query as the guide. We further propose a cross-query loss to improve the robustness of our approach against distractors. With no online learning, no punishment on position or scale changes, no scale smoothing and no trajectory refinement, our pure global instance search based tracker achieves comparable, sometimes much better performance on four large-scale tracking benchmarks (i.e., 52.1% AUC on LaSOT, 63.8% success rate on TLP, 60.3% MaxGM on OxUvA and 75.4% normalized precision on TrackingNet), compared to state-of-the-art approaches that typically require complex post-processing. More importantly, our tracker runs without cumulative errors, i.e., any type of temporary tracking failures will not affect its performance on future frames, making it ideal for long-term tracking. We hope this work will be a strong baseline for long-term tracking and will stimulate future works in this area."
Part-Level Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"Recently, graph convolutional networks have achieved remarkable performance for skeleton-based action recognition. In this work, we identify a problem posed by the GCNs for skeleton-based action recognition, namely part-level action modeling. To address this problem, a novel Part-Level Graph Convolutional Network (PL-GCN) is proposed to capture part-level information of skeletons. Different from previous methods, the partition of body parts is learnable rather than manually defined. We propose two part-level blocks, namely Part Relation block (PR block) and Part Attention block (PA block), which are achieved by two differentiable operations, namely graph pooling operation and graph unpooling operation. The PR block aims at learning high-level relations between body parts while the PA block aims at highlighting the important body parts in the action. Integrating the original GCN with the two blocks, the PL-GCN can learn both part-level and joint-level information of the action. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show the state-of-the-art performance on skeleton-based action recognition and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Relational Prototypical Network for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization,"In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised temporal action localization method on untrimmed videos based on prototypical networks. We observe two challenges posed by weakly supervision, namely action-background separation and action relation construction. Unlike the previous method, we propose to achieve action-background separation only by the original videos. To achieve this, a clustering loss is adopted to separate actions from backgrounds and learn intra-compact features, which helps in detecting complete action instances. Besides, a similarity weighting module is devised to further separate actions from backgrounds. To effectively identify actions, we propose to construct relations among actions for prototype learning. A GCN-based prototype embedding module is introduced to generate relational prototypes. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
AWR: Adaptive Weighting Regression for 3D Hand Pose Estimation,"In this paper, we propose an adaptive weighting regression (AWR) method to leverage the advantages of both detection-based and regression-based method. Hand joint coordinates are estimated as discrete integration of all pixels in dense representation, guided by adaptive weight maps. This learnable aggregation process introduces both dense and joint supervision that allows end-to-end training and brings adaptability to weight maps, making network more accurate and robust. Comprehensive exploration experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and generality of AWR under various experimental settings, especially its usefulness for different types of dense representation and input modality. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on four publicly available datasets, including NYU, ICVL, MSRA and HANDS 2017 dataset."
Domain Adaptive Attention Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (Re-ID) across multiple datasets is a challenging task due to two main reasons: the presence of large cross-dataset distinctions and the absence of annotated target instances. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a domain adaptive attention learning approach to reliably transfer discriminative representation from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. In this approach, a domain adaptive attention model is learned to separate the feature map into domain-shared part and domain-specific part. In this manner, the domain-shared part is used to capture transferable cues that can compensate cross-dataset distinctions and give positive contributions to the target task, while the domain-specific part aims to model the noisy information to avoid the negative transfer caused by domain diversity. A soft label loss is further employed to take full use of unlabeled target data by estimating pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17 benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts."
Weakly-Supervised Video Re-Localization with Multiscale Attention Model,"Video re-localization aims to localize a sub-sequence, called target segment, in an untrimmed reference video that is similar to a given query video. In this work, we propose an attention-based model to accomplish this task in a weakly supervised setting. Namely, we derive our CNN-based model without using the annotated locations of the target segments in reference videos. Our model contains three modules. First, it employs a pre-trained C3D network for feature extraction. Second, we design an attention mechanism to extract multiscale temporal features, which are then used to estimate the similarity between the query video and a reference video. Third, a localization layer detects where the target segment is in the reference video by determining whether each frame in the reference video is consistent with the query video. The resultant CNN model is derived based on the proposed co-attention loss which discriminatively separates the target segment from the reference video. This loss maximizes the similarity between the query video and the target segment while minimizing the similarity between the target segment and the rest of the reference video. Our model can be modified to fully supervised re-localization. Our method is evaluated on a public dataset and achieves the state-of-the-art performance under both weakly supervised and fully supervised settings."
SGAP-Net: Semantic-Guided Attentive Prototypes Network for Few-Shot Human-Object Interaction Recognition,"Extreme instance imbalance among categories and combinatorial explosion make the recognition of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) a challenging task. Few studies have addressed both challenges directly. Motivated by the success of few-shot learning that learns a robust model from a few instances, we formulate HOI as a few-shot task in a meta-learning framework to alleviate the above challenges. Due to the fact that the intrinsic characteristic of HOI is diverse and interactive, we propose a Semantic-Guided Attentive Prototypes Network (SGAP-Net) to learn a semantic-guided metric space where HOI recognition can be performed by computing distances to attentive prototypes of each class. Specifically, the model generates attentive prototypes guided by the category names of actions and objects, which highlight the commonalities of images from the same class in HOI. In addition, we design a novel decision method to alleviate the biases produced by different patterns of the same action in HOI. Finally, in order to realize the task of few-shot HOI, we reorganize two HOI benchmark datasets, i.e., HICO-FS and TUHOI-FS, to realize the task of few-shot HOI. Extensive experimental results on both datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed SGAP-Net approach."
ElixirNet: Relation-Aware Network Architecture Adaptation for Medical Lesion Detection,"Most advances in medical lesion detection network are limited to subtle modification on the conventional detection network designed for natural images. However, there exists a vast domain gap between medical images and natural images where the medical image detection often suffers from several domain-specific challenges, such as high lesion/background similarity, dominant tiny lesions, and severe class imbalance. Is a hand-crafted detection network tailored for natural image undoubtedly good enough over a discrepant medical lesion domain? Is there more powerful operations, filters, and sub-networks that better fit the medical lesion detection problem to be discovered? In this paper, we introduce a novel ElixirNet that includes three components: 1) TruncatedRPN balances positive and negative data for false positive reduction; 2) Auto-lesion Block is automatically customized for medical images to incorporates relation-aware operations among region proposals, and leads to more suitable and efficient classification and localization. 3) Relation transfer module incorporates the semantic relationship and transfers the relevant contextual information with an interpretable graph, thus alleviates the problem of lack of annotations for all types of lesions. Experiments on DeepLesion and Kits19 prove the effectiveness of ElixirNet, achieving improvement of both sensitivity and precision over FPN with fewer parameters."
Divide and Conquer: Question-Guided Spatio-Temporal Contextual Attention for Video Question Answering,"Understanding questions and finding clues for answers are the key for video question answering. Compared with image question answering, video question answering (Video QA) requires to find the clues accurately on both spatial and temporal dimension simultaneously, and thus is more challenging. However, the relationship between spatio-temporal information and question still has not been well utilized in most existing methods for Video QA. To tackle this problem, we propose a Question-Guided Spatio-Temporal Contextual Attention Network (QueST) method. In QueST, we divide the semantic features generated from question into two separate parts: the spatial part and the temporal part, respectively guiding the process of constructing the contextual attention on spatial and temporal dimension. Under the guidance of the corresponding contextual attention, visual features can be better exploited on both spatial and temporal dimensions. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on TGIF-QA dataset, MSRVTT-QA dataset and MSVD-QA dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods have shown that our method can achieve superior performance."
Reasoning with Heterogeneous Graph Alignment for Video Question Answering,"The dominant video question answering methods are based on fine-grained representation or model-specific attention mechanism. They usually process video and question separately, then feed the representations of different modalities into following late fusion networks. Although these methods use information of one modality to boost the other, they neglect to integrate correlations of both inter- and intra-modality in an uniform module. We propose a deep heterogeneous graph alignment network over the video shots and question words. Furthermore, we explore the network architecture from four steps: representation, fusion, alignment, and reasoning. Within our network, the inter- and intra-modality information can be aligned and interacted simultaneously over the heterogeneous graph and used for cross-modal reasoning. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets and conduct extensive ablation study to the effectiveness of the network architecture. Experiments show the network to be superior in quality."
Recurrent Nested Model for Sequence Generation,"Depth has been shown beneficial to neural network models. In this paper, we make an attempt to make the encoder-decoder model deeper for sequence generation. We propose a module that can be plugged into the middle between the encoder and decoder to increase the depth of the whole model. The proposed module follows a nested structure, which is divided into blocks with each block containing several recurrent transition steps. To reduce the training difficulty and preserve the necessary information for the decoder during transitions, inter-block connections and intra-block connections are constructed in our model. The inter-block connections provide the thought vectors from the current block to all the subsequent blocks. The intra-block connections connect all the hidden states entering the current block to the current transition step. The advantages of our model are illustrated on the image captioning and code captioning tasks."
DualVD: An Adaptive Dual Encoding Model for Deep Visual Understanding in Visual Dialogue,"Different from Visual Question Answering task that requires to answer only one question about an image, Visual Dialogue involves multiple questions which cover a broad range of visual content that could be related to any objects, relationships or semantics. The key challenge in Visual Dialogue task is thus to learn a more comprehensive and semantic-rich image representation which may have adaptive attentions on the image for variant questions. In this research, we propose a novel model to depict an image from both visual and semantic perspectives. Specifically, the visual view helps capture the appearance-level information, including objects and their relationships, while the semantic view enables the agent to understand high-level visual semantics from the whole image to the local regions. Futhermore, on top of such multi-view image features, we propose a feature selection framework which is able to adaptively capture question-relevant information hierarchically in fine-grained level. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark Visual Dialogue datasets. More importantly, we can tell which modality (visual or semantic) has more contribution in answering the current question by visualizing the gate values. It gives us insights in understanding of human cognition in Visual Dialogue."
Rethinking Temporal Fusion for Video-Based Person Re-Identification on Semantic and Time Aspect,"Recently, the research interest of person re-identification (ReID) has gradually turned to video-based methods, which acquire a person representation by aggregating frame features of an entire video. However, existing video-based ReID methods do not consider the semantic difference brought by the outputs of different network stages, which potentially compromises the information richness of the person features. Furthermore, traditional methods ignore important relationship among frames, which causes information redundancy in fusion along the time axis. To address these issues, we propose a novel general temporal fusion framework to aggregate frame features on both semantic aspect and time aspect. As for the semantic aspect, a multi-stage fusion network is explored to fuse richer frame features at multiple semantic levels, which can effectively reduce the information loss caused by the traditional single-stage fusion. While, for the time axis, the existing intra-frame attention method is improved by adding a novel inter-frame attention module, which effectively reduces the information redundancy in temporal fusion by taking the relationship among frames into consideration. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively improve the video-based re-identification accuracy, achieving the state-of-the-art performance."
Learning Light Field Angular Super-Resolution via a Geometry-Aware Network,"The acquisition of light field images with high angular resolution is costly. Although many methods have been proposed to improve the angular resolution of a sparsely-sampled light field, they always focus on the light field with a small baseline, which is captured by a consumer light field camera. By making full use of the intrinsic geometry information of light fields, in this paper we propose an end-to-end learning-based approach aiming at angularly super-resolving a sparsely-sampled light field with a large baseline. Our model consists of two learnable modules and a physically-based module. Specifically, it includes a depth estimation module for explicitly modeling the scene geometry, a physically-based warping for novel views synthesis, and a light field blending module specifically designed for light field reconstruction. Moreover, we introduce a novel loss function to promote the preservation of the light field parallax structure. Experimental results over various light field datasets including large baseline light field images demonstrate the significant superiority of our method when compared with state-of-the-art ones, i.e., our method improves the PSNR of the second best method up to 2 dB in average, while saves the execution time 48×. In addition, our method preserves the light field parallax structure better."
EAC-Net: Efficient and Accurate Convolutional Network for Video Recognition,"Research for computation-efficient video understanding is of great importance to real-world deployment. However, most of high-performance approaches are too computationally expensive for practical application. Though several efficiency oriented works are proposed, they inevitably suffer degradation of performance in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we explore a new architecture EAC-Net, enjoying both high efficiency and high performance. Specifically, we propose Motion Guided Temporal Encode (MGTE) blocks for temporal modeling, which exploits motion information and temporal relations among neighbor frames. EAC-Net is then constructed by inserting multiple MGTE blocks to common 2D CNNs. Furthermore, we proposed Atrous Temporal Encode (ATE) block for capturing long-term temporal relations at multiple time scales for further enhancing representation power of EAC-Net. Through experiments on Kinetics, our EAC-Nets achieved better results than TSM models with fewer FLOPs. With same 2D backbones, EAC-Nets outperformed Non-Local I3D counterparts by achieving higher accuracy with only about 7× fewer FLOPs. On Something-Something-V1 dataset, EAC-Net achieved 47% top-1 accuracy with 70G FLOPs which is 0.9% more accurate and 8× less FLOPs than that of Non-Local I3D+GCN."
SSAH: Semi-Supervised Adversarial Deep Hashing with Self-Paced Hard Sample Generation,"Deep hashing methods have been proved to be effective and efficient for large-scale Web media search. The success of these data-driven methods largely depends on collecting sufficient labeled data, which is usually a crucial limitation in practical cases. The current solutions to this issue utilize Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to augment data in semi-supervised learning. However, existing GAN-based methods treat image generations and hashing learning as two isolated processes, leading to generation ineffectiveness. Besides, most works fail to exploit the semantic information in unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Self-pace Adversarial Hashing method, named SSAH to solve the above problems in a unified framework. The SSAH method consists of an adversarial network (A-Net) and a hashing network (H-Net). To improve the quality of generative images, first, the A-Net learns hard samples with multi-scale occlusions and multi-angle rotated deformations which compete against the learning of accurate hashing codes. Second, we design a novel self-paced hard generation policy to gradually increase the hashing difficulty of generated samples. To make use of the semantic information in unlabeled ones, we propose a semi-supervised consistent loss. The experimental results show that our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art models on both the widely-used hashing datasets and fine-grained datasets."
Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Shot Knowledge Distillation for Image-Based Object Re-Identification,"Object re-identification (re-id) aims to identify a specific object across times or camera views, with the person re-id and vehicle re-id as the most widely studied applications. Re-id is challenging because of the variations in viewpoints, (human) poses, and occlusions. Multi-shots of the same object can cover diverse viewpoints/poses and thus provide more comprehensive information. In this paper, we propose exploiting the multi-shots of the same identity to guide the feature learning of each individual image. Specifically, we design an Uncertainty-aware Multi-shot Teacher-Student (UMTS) Network. It consists of a teacher network (T-net) that learns the comprehensive features from multiple images of the same object, and a student network (S-net) that takes a single image as input. In particular, we take into account the data dependent heteroscedastic uncertainty for effectively transferring the knowledge from the T-net to S-net. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make use of multi-shots of an object in a teacher-student learning manner for effectively boosting the single image based re-id. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the popular vehicle re-id and person re-id datasets. In inference, the S-net alone significantly outperforms the baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance."
Semantics-Aligned Representation Learning for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (reID) aims to match person images to retrieve the ones with the same identity. This is a challenging task, as the images to be matched are generally semantically misaligned due to the diversity of human poses and capture viewpoints, incompleteness of the visible bodies (due to occlusion), etc. In this paper, we propose a framework that drives the reID network to learn semantics-aligned feature representation through delicate supervision designs. Specifically, we build a Semantics Aligning Network (SAN) which consists of a base network as encoder (SA-Enc) for re-ID, and a decoder (SA-Dec) for reconstructing/regressing the densely semantics aligned full texture image. We jointly train the SAN under the supervisions of person re-identification and aligned texture generation. Moreover, at the decoder, besides the reconstruction loss, we add Triplet ReID constraints over the feature maps as the perceptual losses. The decoder is discarded in the inference and thus our scheme is computationally efficient. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. We achieve the state-of-the-art performances on the benchmark datasets CUHK03, Market1501, MSMT17, and the partial person reID dataset Partial REID."
Overcoming Language Priors in VQA via Decomposed Linguistic Representations,"Most existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) models overly rely on language priors between questions and answers. In this paper, we present a novel method of language attention-based VQA that learns decomposed linguistic representations of questions and utilizes the representations to infer answers for overcoming language priors. We introduce a modular language attention mechanism to parse a question into three phrase representations: type representation, object representation, and concept representation. We use the type representation to identify the question type and the possible answer set (yes/no or specific concepts such as colors or numbers), and the object representation to focus on the relevant region of an image. The concept representation is verified with the attended region to infer the final answer. The proposed method decouples the language-based concept discovery and vision-based concept verification in the process of answer inference to prevent language priors from dominating the answering process. Experiments on the VQA-CP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Pose-Guided Multi-Granularity Attention Network for Text-Based Person Search,"Text-based person search aims to retrieve the corresponding person images in an image database by virtue of a describing sentence about the person, which poses great potential for various applications such as video surveillance. Extracting visual contents corresponding to the human description is the key to this cross-modal matching problem. Moreover, correlated images and descriptions involve different granularities of semantic relevance, which is usually ignored in previous methods. To exploit the multilevel corresponding visual contents, we propose a pose-guided multi-granularity attention network (PMA). Firstly, we propose a coarse alignment network (CA) to select the related image regions to the global description by a similarity-based attention. To further capture the phrase-related visual body part, a fine-grained alignment network (FA) is proposed, which employs pose information to learn latent semantic alignment between visual body part and textual noun phrase. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we perform extensive experiments on the CUHK Person Description Dataset (CUHK-PEDES) which is currently the only available dataset for text-based person search. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 15 % in terms of the top-1 metric."
Associative Variational Auto-Encoder with Distributed Latent Spaces and Associators,"In this paper, we propose a novel structure for a multi-modal data association referred to as Associative Variational Auto-Encoder (AVAE). In contrast to the existing models using a shared latent space among modalities, our structure adopts distributed latent spaces for multi-modalities which are connected through cross-modal associators. The proposed structure successfully associates even heterogeneous modality data and easily incorporates the additional modality to the entire network via the associator. Furthermore, in our structure, only a small amount of supervised (paired) data is enough to train associators after training auto-encoders in an unsupervised manner. Through experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed structure is validated on various datasets including visual and auditory data."
Real-Time Object Tracking via Meta-Learning: Efficient Model Adaptation and One-Shot Channel Pruning,"We propose a novel meta-learning framework for real-time object tracking with efficient model adaptation and channel pruning. Given an object tracker, our framework learns to fine-tune its model parameters in only a few gradient-descent iterations during tracking while pruning its network channels using the target ground-truth at the first frame. Such a learning problem is formulated as a meta-learning task, where a meta-tracker is trained by updating its meta-parameters for initial weights, learning rates, and pruning masks through carefully designed tracking simulations. The integrated meta-tracker greatly improves tracking performance by accelerating the convergence of online learning and reducing the cost of feature computation. Experimental evaluation on the standard datasets demonstrates its outstanding accuracy and speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Hide-and-Tell: Learning to Bridge Photo Streams for Visual Storytelling,"Visual storytelling is a task of creating a short story based on photo streams. Unlike existing visual captioning, storytelling aims to contain not only factual descriptions, but also human-like narration and semantics. However, the VIST dataset consists only of a small, fixed number of photos per story. Therefore, the main challenge of visual storytelling is to fill in the visual gap between photos with narrative and imaginative story. In this paper, we propose to explicitly learn to imagine a storyline that bridges the visual gap. During training, one or more photos is randomly omitted from the input stack, and we train the network to produce a full plausible story even with missing photo(s). Furthermore, we propose for visual storytelling a hide-and-tell model, which is designed to learn non-local relations across the photo streams and to refine and improve conventional RNN-based models. In experiments, we show that our scheme of hide-and-tell, and the network design are indeed effective at storytelling, and that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in automatic metrics. Finally, we qualitatively show the learned ability to interpolate storyline over visual gaps."
Synthetic Depth Transfer for Monocular 3D Object Pose Estimation in the Wild,"Monocular object pose estimation is an important yet challenging computer vision problem. Depth features can provide useful information for pose estimation. However, existing methods rely on real depth images to extract depth features, leading to its difficulty on various applications. In this paper, we aim at extracting RGB and depth features from a single RGB image with the help of synthetic RGB-depth image pairs for object pose estimation. Specifically, a deep convolutional neural network is proposed with an RGB-to-Depth Embedding module and a Synthetic-Real Adaptation module. The embedding module is trained with synthetic pair data to learn a depth-oriented embedding space between RGB and depth images optimized for object pose estimation. The adaptation module is to further align distributions from synthetic to real data. Compared to existing methods, our method does not need any real depth images and can be trained easily with large-scale synthetic data. Extensive experiments and comparisons show that our method achieves best performance on a challenging public PASCAL 3D+ dataset in all the metrics, which substantiates the superiority of our method and the above modules."
Group-Wise Dynamic Dropout Based on Latent Semantic Variations,"Dropout regularization has been widely used in various deep neural networks to combat overfitting. It works by training a network to be more robust on information-degraded data points for better generalization. Conventional dropout and variants are often applied to individual hidden units in a layer to break up co-adaptations of feature detectors. In this paper, we propose an adaptive dropout to reduce the co-adaptations in a group-wise manner by coarse semantic information to improve feature discriminability. In particular, we showed that adjusting the dropout probability based on local feature densities can not only improve the classification performance significantly but also enhance the network robustness against adversarial examples in some cases. The proposed approach was evaluated in comparison with the baseline and several state-of-the-art adaptive dropouts over four public datasets of Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN."
Deep Generative Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks for Scene Graph Generation,"We propose a new algorithm, called Deep Generative Probabilistic Graph Neural Networks (DG-PGNN), to generate a scene graph for an image. The input to DG-PGNN is an image, together with a set of region-grounded captions and object bounding-box proposals for the image. To generate the scene graph, DG-PGNN constructs and updates a new model, called a Probabilistic Graph Network (PGN). A PGN can be thought of as a scene graph with uncertainty: it represents each node and each edge by a CNN feature vector and defines a probability mass function (PMF) for node-type (object category) of each node and edge-type (predicate class) of each edge. The DG-PGNN sequentially adds a new node to the current PGN by learning the optimal ordering in a Deep Q-learning framework, where states are partial PGNs, actions choose a new node, and rewards are defined based on the ground-truth. After adding a node, DG-PGNN uses message passing to update the feature vectors of the current PGN by leveraging contextual relationship information, object co-occurrences, and language priors from captions. The updated features are then used to fine-tune the PMFs. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art results on the Visual Genome dataset for scene graph generation. We also show that the scene graphs constructed by DG-PGNN improve performance on the visual question answering task, for questions that need reasoning about objects and their interactions in the scene context."
Tell Me What They're Holding: Weakly-Supervised Object Detection with Transferable Knowledge from Human-Object Interaction,"In this work, we introduce a novel weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) paradigm to detect objects belonging to rare classes that have not many examples using transferable knowledge from human-object interactions (HOI). While WSOD shows lower performance than full supervision, we mainly focus on HOI as the main context which can strongly supervise complex semantics in images. Therefore, we propose a novel module called RRPN (relational region proposal network) which outputs an object-localizing attention map only with human poses and action verbs. In the source domain, we fully train an object detector and the RRPN with full supervision of HOI. With transferred knowledge about localization map from the trained RRPN, a new object detector can learn unseen objects with weak verbal supervision of HOI without bounding box annotations in the target domain. Because the RRPN is designed as an add-on type, we can apply it not only to the object detection but also to other domains such as semantic segmentation. The experimental results on HICO-DET dataset show the possibility that the proposed method can be a cheap alternative for the current supervised object detection paradigm. Moreover, qualitative results demonstrate that our model can properly localize unseen objects on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets."
MULE: Multimodal Universal Language Embedding,"Existing vision-language methods typically support two languages at a time at most. In this paper, we present a modular approach which can easily be incorporated into existing vision-language methods in order to support many languages. We accomplish this by learning a single shared Multimodal Universal Language Embedding (MULE) which has been visually-semantically aligned across all languages. Then we learn to relate MULE to visual data as if it were a single language. Our method is not architecture specific, unlike prior work which typically learned separate branches for each language, enabling our approach to easily be adapted to many vision-language methods and tasks. Since MULE learns a single language branch in the multimodal model, we can also scale to support many languages, and languages with fewer annotations can take advantage of the good representation learned from other (more abundant) language data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our embeddings on the bidirectional image-sentence retrieval task, supporting up to four languages in a single model. In addition, we show that Machine Translation can be used for data augmentation in multilingual learning, which, combined with MULE, improves mean recall by up to 20.2% on a single language compared to prior work, with the most significant gains seen on languages with relatively few annotations. Our code is publicly available1."
REST: Performance Improvement of a Black Box Model via RL-Based Spatial Transformation,"In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) have become a highly active area of research, and shown remarkable achievements on a variety of computer vision tasks. DNNs, however, are known to often make overconfident yet incorrect predictions on out-of-distribution samples, which can be a major obstacle to real-world deployments because the training dataset is always limited compared to diverse real-world samples. Thus, it is fundamental to provide guarantees of robustness to the distribution shift between training and test time when we construct DNN models in practice. Moreover, in many cases, the deep learning models are deployed as black boxes and the performance has been already optimized for a training dataset, thus changing the black box itself can lead to performance degradation. We here study the robustness to the geometric transformations in a specific condition where the black-box image classifier is given. We propose an additional learner, REinforcement Spatial Transform learner (REST), that transforms the warped input data into samples regarded as in-distribution by the black-box models. Our work aims to improve the robustness by adding a REST module in front of any black boxes and training only the REST module without retraining the original black box model in an end-to-end manner, i.e. we try to convert the real-world data into training distribution which the performance of the black-box model is best suited for. We use a confidence score that is obtained from the black-box model to determine whether the transformed input is drawn from in-distribution. We empirically show that our method has an advantage in generalization to geometric transformations and sample efficiency."
Spiking-YOLO: Spiking Neural Network for Energy-Efficient Object Detection,"Over the past decade, deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of applications. As we try to solve more advanced problems, increasing demands for computing and power resources has become inevitable. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread interest as the third-generation of neural networks due to their event-driven and low-powered nature. SNNs, however, are difficult to train, mainly owing to their complex dynamics of neurons and non-differentiable spike operations. Furthermore, their applications have been limited to relatively simple tasks such as image classification. In this study, we investigate the performance degradation of SNNs in a more challenging regression problem (i.e., object detection). Through our in-depth analysis, we introduce two novel methods: channel-wise normalization and signed neuron with imbalanced threshold, both of which provide fast and accurate information transmission for deep SNNs. Consequently, we present a first spiked-based object detection model, called Spiking-YOLO. Our experiments show that Spiking-YOLO achieves remarkable results that are comparable (up to 98%) to those of Tiny YOLO on non-trivial datasets, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Furthermore, Spiking-YOLO on a neuromorphic chip consumes approximately 280 times less energy than Tiny YOLO and converges 2.3 to 4 times faster than previous SNN conversion methods."
FISR: Deep Joint Frame Interpolation and Super-Resolution with a Multi-Scale Temporal Loss,"Super-resolution (SR) has been widely used to convert low-resolution legacy videos to high-resolution (HR) ones, to suit the increasing resolution of displays (e.g. UHD TVs). However, it becomes easier for humans to notice motion artifacts (e.g. motion judder) in HR videos being rendered on larger-sized display devices. Thus, broadcasting standards support higher frame rates for UHD (Ultra High Definition) videos (4K@60 fps, 8K@120 fps), meaning that applying SR only is insufficient to produce genuine high quality videos. Hence, to up-convert legacy videos for realistic applications, not only SR but also video frame interpolation (VFI) is necessitated. In this paper, we first propose a joint VFI-SR framework for up-scaling the spatio-temporal resolution of videos from 2K 30 fps to 4K 60 fps. For this, we propose a novel training scheme with a multi-scale temporal loss that imposes temporal regularization on the input video sequence, which can be applied to any general video-related task. The proposed structure is analyzed in depth with extensive experiments."
JSI-GAN: GAN-Based Joint Super-Resolution and Inverse Tone-Mapping with Pixel-Wise Task-Specific Filters for UHD HDR Video,"Joint learning of super-resolution (SR) and inverse tone-mapping (ITM) has been explored recently, to convert legacy low resolution (LR) standard dynamic range (SDR) videos to high resolution (HR) high dynamic range (HDR) videos for the growing need of UHD HDR TV/broadcasting applications. However, previous CNN-based methods directly reconstruct the HR HDR frames from LR SDR frames, and are only trained with a simple L2 loss. In this paper, we take a divide-and-conquer approach in designing a novel GAN-based joint SR-ITM network, called JSI-GAN, which is composed of three task-specific subnets: an image reconstruction subnet, a detail restoration (DR) subnet and a local contrast enhancement (LCE) subnet. We delicately design these subnets so that they are appropriately trained for the intended purpose, learning a pair of pixel-wise 1D separable filters via the DR subnet for detail restoration and a pixel-wise 2D local filter by the LCE subnet for contrast enhancement. Moreover, to train the JSI-GAN effectively, we propose a novel detail GAN loss alongside the conventional GAN loss, which helps enhancing both local details and contrasts to reconstruct high quality HR HDR results. When all subnets are jointly trained well, the predicted HR HDR results of higher quality are obtained with at least 0.41 dB gain in PSNR over those generated by the previous methods. The official Tensorflow code is available at https://github.com/JihyongOh/JSI-GAN."
Unpaired Image Enhancement Featuring Reinforcement-Learning-Controlled Image Editing Software,"This paper tackles unpaired image enhancement, a task of learning a mapping function which transforms input images into enhanced images in the absence of input-output image pairs. Our method is based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), but instead of simply generating images with a neural network, we enhance images utilizing image editing software such as Adobe® Photoshop® for the following three benefits: enhanced images have no artifacts, the same enhancement can be applied to larger images, and the enhancement is interpretable. To incorporate image editing software into a GAN, we propose a reinforcement learning framework where the generator works as the agent that selects the software's parameters and is rewarded when it fools the discriminator. Our framework can use high-quality non-differentiable filters present in image editing software, which enables image enhancement with high performance. We apply the proposed method to two unpaired image enhancement tasks: photo enhancement and face beautification. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance, compared to the performances of the state-of-the-art methods based on unpaired learning."
Adversary for Social Good: Protecting Familial Privacy through Joint Adversarial Attacks,"Social media has been widely used among billions of people with dramatical participation of new users every day. Among them, social networks maintain the basic social characters and host huge amount of personal data. While protecting user sensitive data is obvious and demanding, information leakage due to adversarial attacks is somehow unavoidable, yet hard to detect. For example, implicit social relation such as family information may be simply exposed by network structure and hosted face images through off-the-shelf graph neural networks (GNN), which will be empirically proved in this paper. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack algorithm for social good. First, we start from conventional visual family understanding problem, and demonstrate that familial information can easily be exposed to attackers by connecting sneak shots to social networks. Second, to protect family privacy on social networks, we propose a novel adversarial attack algorithm that produces both adversarial features and graph under a given budget. Specifically, both features on the node and edges between nodes will be perturbed gradually such that the probe images and its family information can not be identified correctly through conventional GNN. Extensive experiments on a popular visual social dataset have demonstrated that our defense strategy can significantly mitigate the impacts of family information leakage."
Kinematic-Structure-Preserved Representation for Unsupervised 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Estimation of 3D human pose from monocular image has gained considerable attention, as a key step to several human-centric applications. However, generalizability of human pose estimation models developed using supervision on large-scale in-studio datasets remains questionable, as these models often perform unsatisfactorily on unseen in-the-wild environments. Though weakly-supervised models have been proposed to address this shortcoming, performance of such models relies on availability of paired supervision on some related task, such as 2D pose or multi-view image pairs. In contrast, we propose a novel kinematic-structure-preserved unsupervised 3D pose estimation framework, which is not restrained by any paired or unpaired weak supervisions. Our pose estimation framework relies on a minimal set of prior knowledge that defines the underlying kinematic 3D structure, such as skeletal joint connectivity information with bone-length ratios in a fixed canonical scale. The proposed model employs three consecutive differentiable transformations namely forward-kinematics, camera-projection and spatial-map transformation. This design not only acts as a suitable bottleneck stimulating effective pose disentanglement, but also yields interpretable latent pose representations avoiding training of an explicit latent embedding to pose mapper. Furthermore, devoid of unstable adversarial setup, we re-utilize the decoder to formalize an energy-based loss, which enables us to learn from in-the-wild videos, beyond laboratory settings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art unsupervised and weakly-supervised pose estimation performance on both Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Qualitative results on unseen environments further establish our superior generalization ability."
Background Suppression Network for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization,"Weakly-supervised temporal action localization is a very challenging problem because frame-wise labels are not given in the training stage while the only hint is video-level labels: whether each video contains action frames of interest. Previous methods aggregate frame-level class scores to produce video-level prediction and learn from video-level action labels. This formulation does not fully model the problem in that background frames are forced to be misclassified as action classes to predict video-level labels accurately. In this paper, we design Background Suppression Network (BaS-Net) which introduces an auxiliary class for background and has a two-branch weight-sharing architecture with an asymmetrical training strategy. This enables BaS-Net to suppress activations from background frames to improve localization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BaS-Net and its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods on the most popular benchmarks – THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet. Our code and the trained model are available at https://github.com/Pilhyeon/BaSNet-pytorch."
Multi-Question Learning for Visual Question Answering,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) raises a great challenge for computer vision and natural language processing communities. Most of the existing approaches consider video-question pairs individually during training. However, we observe that there are usually multiple (either sequentially generated or not) questions for the target video in a VQA task, and the questions themselves have abundant semantic relations. To explore these relations, we propose a new paradigm for VQA termed Multi-Question Learning (MQL). Inspired by the multi-task learning, MQL learns from multiple questions jointly together with their corresponding answers for a target video sequence. The learned representations of video-question pairs are then more general to be transferred for new questions. We further propose an effective VQA framework and design a training procedure for MQL, where the specifically designed attention network models the relation between input video and corresponding questions, enabling multiple video-question pairs to be co-trained. Experimental results on public datasets show the favorable performance of the proposed MQL-VQA framework compared to state-of-the-arts."
Unicoder-VL: A Universal Encoder for Vision and Language by Cross-Modal Pre-Training,"We propose Unicoder-VL, a universal encoder that aims to learn joint representations of vision and language in a pre-training manner. Borrow ideas from cross-lingual pre-trained models, such as XLM (Lample and Conneau 2019) and Unicoder (Huang et al. 2019), both visual and linguistic contents are fed into a multi-layer Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) for the cross-modal pre-training, where three pre-trained tasks are employed, including Masked Language Modeling(MLM), Masked Object Classification(MOC) and Visual-linguistic Matching(VLM). The first two tasks learn context-aware representations for input tokens based on linguistic and visual contents jointly. The last task tries to predict whether an image and a text describe each other. After pretraining on large-scale image-caption pairs, we transfer Unicoder-VL to caption-based image-text retrieval and visual commonsense reasoning, with just one additional output layer. We achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results on both two tasks and show the powerful ability of the cross-modal pre-training."
Multi-Spectral Vehicle Re-Identification: A Challenge,"Vehicle re-identification (Re-ID) is a crucial task in smart city and intelligent transportation, aiming to match vehicle images across non-overlapping surveillance camera views. Currently, most works focus on RGB-based vehicle Re-ID, which limits its capability of real-life applications in adverse environments such as dark environments and bad weathers. IR (Infrared) spectrum imaging offers complementary information to relieve the illumination issue in computer vision tasks. Furthermore, vehicle Re-ID suffers a big challenge of the diverse appearance with different views, such as trucks. In this work, we address the RGB and IR vehicle Re-ID problem and contribute a multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID benchmark named RGBN300, including RGB and NIR (Near Infrared) vehicle images of 300 identities from 8 camera views, giving in total 50125 RGB images and 50125 NIR images respectively. In addition, we have acquired additional TIR (Thermal Infrared) data for 100 vehicles from RGBN300 to form another dataset for three-spectral vehicle Re-ID. Furthermore, we propose a Heterogeneity-collaboration Aware Multi-stream convolutional Network (HAMNet) towards automatically fusing different spectrum features in an end-to-end learning framework. Comprehensive experiments on prevalent networks show that our HAMNet can effectively integrate multi-spectral data for robust vehicle Re-ID in day and night. Our work provides a benchmark dataset for RGB-NIR and RGB-NIR-TIR multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID and a baseline network for both research and industrial communities. The dataset and baseline codes are available at: https://github.com/ttaalle/multi-modal-vehicle-Re-ID."
Simple Pose: Rethinking and Improving a Bottom-up Approach for Multi-Person Pose Estimation,"We rethink a well-known bottom-up approach for multi-person pose estimation and propose an improved one. The improved approach surpasses the baseline significantly thanks to (1) an intuitional yet more sensible representation, which we refer to as body parts to encode the connection information between keypoints, (2) an improved stacked hourglass network with attention mechanisms, (3) a novel focal L2 loss which is dedicated to “hard” keypoint and keypoint association (body part) mining, and (4) a robust greedy keypoint assignment algorithm for grouping the detected keypoints into individual poses. Our approach not only works straightforwardly but also outperforms the baseline by about 15% in average precision and is comparable to the state of the art on the MS-COCO test-dev dataset. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available on our project page1."
Learning Part Generation and Assembly for Structure-Aware Shape Synthesis,"Learning powerful deep generative models for 3D shape synthesis is largely hindered by the difficulty in ensuring plausibility encompassing correct topology and reasonable geometry. Indeed, learning the distribution of plausible 3D shapes seems a daunting task for the holistic approaches, given the significant topological variations of 3D objects even within the same category. Enlightened by the fact that 3D shape structure is characterized as part composition and placement, we propose to model 3D shape variations with a part-aware deep generative network, coined as PAGENet. The network is composed of an array of per-part VAE-GANs, generating semantic parts composing a complete shape, followed by a part assembly module that estimates a transformation for each part to correlate and assemble them into a plausible structure. Through delegating the learning of part composition and part placement into separate networks, the difficulty of modeling structural variations of 3D shapes is greatly reduced. We demonstrate through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations that PAGENet generates 3D shapes with plausible, diverse and detailed structure, and show two applications, i.e., semantic shape segmentation and part-based shape editing."
Hierarchical Knowledge Squeezed Adversarial Network Compression,"Deep network compression has been achieved notable progress via knowledge distillation, where a teacher-student learning manner is adopted by using predetermined loss. Recently, more focuses have been transferred to employ the adversarial training to minimize the discrepancy between distributions of output from two networks. However, they always emphasize on result-oriented learning while neglecting the scheme of process-oriented learning, leading to the loss of rich information contained in the whole network pipeline. Whereas in other (non GAN-based) process-oriented methods, the knowledge have usually been transferred in a redundant manner. Observing that, the small network can not perfectly mimic a large one due to the huge gap of network scale, we propose a knowledge transfer method, involving effective intermediate supervision, under the adversarial training framework to learn the student network. Different from the other intermediate supervision methods, we design the knowledge representation in a compact form by introducing a task-driven attention mechanism. Meanwhile, to improve the representation capability of the attention-based method, a hierarchical structure is utilized so that powerful but highly squeezed knowledge is realized and the knowledge from teacher network could accommodate the size of student network. Extensive experimental results on three typical benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that our method achieves highly superior performances against state-of-the-art methods."
Age Progression and Regression with Spatial Attention Modules,"Age progression and regression refers to aesthetically rendering a given face image to present effects of face aging and rejuvenation, respectively. Although numerous studies have been conducted in this topic, there are two major problems: 1) multiple models are usually trained to simulate different age mappings, and 2) the photo-realism of generated face images is heavily influenced by the variation of training images in terms of pose, illumination, and background. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to achieve age progression and regression simultaneously. Particularly, since face aging and rejuvenation are largely different in terms of image translation patterns, we model these two processes using two separate generators, each dedicated to one age changing process. In addition, we exploit spatial attention mechanisms to limit image modifications to regions closely related to age changes, so that images with high visual fidelity could be synthesized for in-the-wild cases. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the ability of our model in synthesizing lifelike face images at desired ages with personalized features well preserved, and keeping age-irrelevant regions unchanged."
Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network,"Tremendous research efforts have been made to thrive deep domain adaptation (DA) by seeking domain-invariant features. Most existing deep DA models only focus on aligning feature representations of task-specific layers across domains while integrating a totally shared convolutional architecture for source and target. However, we argue that such strongly-shared convolutional layers might be harmful for domain-specific feature learning when source and target data distribution differs to a large extent. In this paper, we relax a shared-convnets assumption made by previous DA methods and propose a Domain Conditioned Adaptation Network (DCAN), which aims to excite distinct convolutional channels with a domain conditioned channel attention mechanism. As a result, the critical low-level domain-dependent knowledge could be explored appropriately. As far as we know, this is the first work to explore the domain-wise convolutional channel activation for deep DA networks. Moreover, to effectively align high-level feature distributions across two domains, we further deploy domain conditioned feature correction blocks after task-specific layers, which will explicitly correct the domain discrepancy. Extensive experiments on three cross-domain benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin, especially on very tough cross-domain learning tasks."
Appearance and Motion Enhancement for Video-Based Person Re-Identification,"In this paper, we propose an Appearance and Motion Enhancement Model (AMEM) for video-based person re-identification to enrich the two kinds of information contained in the backbone network in a more interpretable way. Concretely, human attribute recognition under the supervision of pseudo labels is exploited in an Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to help enrich the appearance and semantic information. A Motion Enhancement Module (MEM) is designed to capture the identity-discriminative walking patterns through predicting future frames. Despite a complex model with several auxiliary modules during training, only the backbone model plus two small branches are kept for similarity evaluation which constitute a simple but effective final model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular video-based person ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and the state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods."
Attention-Based Multi-Modal Fusion Network for Semantic Scene Completion,"This paper presents an end-to-end 3D convolutional network named attention-based multi-modal fusion network (AMFNet) for the semantic scene completion (SSC) task of inferring the occupancy and semantic labels of a volumetric 3D scene from single-view RGB-D images. Compared with previous methods which use only the semantic features extracted from RGB-D images, the proposed AMFNet learns to perform effective 3D scene completion and semantic segmentation simultaneously via leveraging the experience of inferring 2D semantic segmentation from RGB-D images as well as the reliable depth cues in spatial dimension. It is achieved by employing a multi-modal fusion architecture boosted from 2D semantic segmentation and a 3D semantic completion network empowered by residual attention blocks. We validate our method on both the synthetic SUNCG-RGBD dataset and the real NYUv2 dataset and the results show that our method respectively achieves the gains of 2.5% and 2.6% on the synthetic SUNCG-RGBD dataset and the real NYUv2 dataset against the state-of-the-art method."
OVL: One-View Learning for Human Retrieval,"This paper considers a novel problem, named One-View Learning (OVL), in human retrieval a.k.a. person re-identification (re-ID). Unlike fully-supervised learning, OVL only requires pretty cheap annotation cost: labeled training images are only provided from one camera view (source view/domain), while the annotations of training images from other camera views (target views/domains) are not available. OVL is a problem of multi-target open set domain adaptation that is difficult for existing domain adaptation methods to handle. This is because 1) unlabeled samples are drawn from multiple target views in different distributions, and 2) the target views may contain samples of “unknown identity” that are not shared by the source view. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel one-view learning framework for person re-ID. This is achieved by adversarial multi-view learning (AMVL) and adversarial unknown rejection learning (AURL). The former learns a multi-view discriminator by adversarial learning to align the feature distributions between all views. The later is designed to reject unknown samples from target views through adversarial learning with two unknown identity classifiers. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over state-of-the-art domain adaptation and semi-supervised methods."
Gated Fully Fusion for Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation generates comprehensive understanding of scenes through densely predicting the category for each pixel. High-level features from Deep Convolutional Neural Networks already demonstrate their effectiveness in semantic segmentation tasks, however the coarse resolution of high-level features often leads to inferior results for small/thin objects where detailed information is important. It is natural to consider importing low level features to compensate for the lost detailed information in high-level features. Unfortunately, simply combining multi-level features suffers from the semantic gap among them. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, named Gated Fully Fusion(GFF), to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way. Specifically, features at each level are enhanced by higher-level features with stronger semantics and lower-level features with more details, and gates are used to control the propagation of useful information which significantly reduces the noises during fusion. We achieve the state of the art results on four challenging scene parsing datasets including Cityscapes, Pascal Context, COCO-stuff and ADE20K."
ScaleNet - Improve CNNs through Recursively Rescaling Objects,"Deep networks are often not scale-invariant hence their performance can vary wildly if recognizable objects are at an unseen scale occurring only at testing time. In this paper, we propose ScaleNet, which recursively predicts object scale in a deep learning framework. With an explicit objective to predict the scale of objects in images, ScaleNet enables pretrained deep learning models to identify objects in the scales that are not present in their training sets. By recursively calling ScaleNet, one can generalize to very large scale changes unseen in the training set. To demonstrate the robustness of our proposed framework, we conduct experiments with pretrained as well as fine-tuned classification and detection frameworks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MS COCO datasets and results reveal that our proposed framework significantly boosts the performances of deep networks."
Relation-Guided Spatial Attention and Temporal Refinement for Video-Based Person Re-Identification,"Video-based person re-identification has received considerable attention in recent years due to its significant application in video surveillance. Compared with image-based person re-identification, video-based person re-identification is characterized by a much richer context, which raises the significance of identifying informative regions and fusing the temporal information across frames. In this paper, we propose two relation-guided modules to learn reinforced feature representations for effective re-identification. First, a relation-guided spatial attention (RGSA) module is designed to explore the discriminative regions globally. The weight at each position is determined by its feature as well as the relation features from other positions, revealing the dependence between local and global contents. Based on the adaptively weighted frame-level feature, then, a relation-guided temporal refinement (RGTR) module is proposed to further refine the feature representations across frames. The learned relation information via the RGTR module enables the individual frames to complement each other in an aggregation manner, leading to robust video-level feature representations. Extensive experiments on four prevalent benchmarks verify the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method."
Geometry-Driven Self-Supervised Method for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"The neural network based approach for 3D human pose estimation from monocular images has attracted growing interest. However, annotating 3D poses is a labor-intensive and expensive process. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach to avoid the need of manual annotations. Different from existing weakly/self-supervised methods that require extra unpaired 3D ground-truth data to alleviate the depth ambiguity problem, our method trains the network only relying on geometric knowledge without any additional 3D pose annotations. The proposed method follows the two-stage pipeline: 2D pose estimation and 2D-to-3D pose lifting. We design the transform re-projection loss that is an effective way to explore multi-view consistency for training the 2D-to-3D lifting network. Besides, we adopt the confidences of 2D joints to integrate losses from different views to alleviate the influence of noises caused by the self-occlusion problem. Finally, we design a two-branch training architecture, which helps to preserve the scale information of re-projected 2D poses during training, resulting in accurate 3D pose predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two popular 3D human pose datasets, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results show that our method significantly outperforms recent weakly/self-supervised approaches."
Natural Image Matting via Guided Contextual Attention,"Over the last few years, deep learning based approaches have achieved outstanding improvements in natural image matting. Many of these methods can generate visually plausible alpha estimations, but typically yield blurry structures or textures in the semitransparent area. This is due to the local ambiguity of transparent objects. One possible solution is to leverage the far-surrounding information to estimate the local opacity. Traditional affinity-based methods often suffer from the high computational complexity, which are not suitable for high resolution alpha estimation. Inspired by affinity-based method and the successes of contextual attention in inpainting, we develop a novel end-to-end approach for natural image matting with a guided contextual attention module, which is specifically designed for image matting. Guided contextual attention module directly propagates high-level opacity information globally based on the learned low-level affinity. The proposed method can mimic information flow of affinity-based methods and utilize rich features learned by deep neural networks simultaneously. Experiment results on Composition-1k testing set and alphamatting.com benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in natural image matting. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Yaoyi-Li/GCA-Matting."
Learning Transferable Adversarial Examples via Ghost Networks,"Recent development of adversarial attacks has proven that ensemble-based methods outperform traditional, non-ensemble ones in black-box attack. However, as it is computationally prohibitive to acquire a family of diverse models, these methods achieve inferior performance constrained by the limited number of models to be ensembled.In this paper, we propose Ghost Networks to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. The critical principle of ghost networks is to apply feature-level perturbations to an existing model to potentially create a huge set of diverse models. After that, models are subsequently fused by longitudinal ensemble. Extensive experimental results suggest that the number of networks is essential for improving the transferability of adversarial examples, but it is less necessary to independently train different networks and ensemble them in an intensive aggregation way. Instead, our work can be used as a computationally cheap and easily applied plug-in to improve adversarial approaches both in single-model and multi-model attack, compatible with residual and non-residual networks. By reproducing the NeurIPS 2017 adversarial competition, our method outperforms the No.1 attack submission by a large margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/LiYingwei/ghost-network."
Finding Action Tubes with a Sparse-to-Dense Framework,"The task of spatial-temporal action detection has attracted increasing researchers. Existing dominant methods solve this problem by relying on short-term information and dense serial-wise detection on each individual frames or clips. Despite their effectiveness, these methods showed inadequate use of long-term information and are prone to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose for the first time, an efficient framework that generates action tube proposals from video streams with a single forward pass in a sparse-to-dense manner. There are two key characteristics in this framework: (1) Both long-term and short-term sampled information are explicitly utilized in our spatio-temporal network, (2) A new dynamic feature sampling module (DTS) is designed to effectively approximate the tube output while keeping the system tractable. We evaluate the efficacy of our model on the UCF101-24, JHMDB-21 and UCFSports benchmark datasets, achieving promising results that are competitive to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed sparse-to-dense strategy rendered our framework about 7.6 times more efficient than the nearest competitor."
Real-Time Scene Text Detection with Differentiable Binarization,"Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text detection, as the segmentation results can more accurately describe scene text of various shapes such as curve text. However, the post-processing of binarization is essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18, our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62 FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset. Code is available at: https://github.com/MhLiao/DB."
Object Instance Mining for Weakly Supervised Object Detection,"Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) using only image-level annotations has attracted growing attention over the past few years. Existing approaches using multiple instance learning easily fall into local optima, because such mechanism tends to learn from the most discriminative object in an image for each category. Therefore, these methods suffer from missing object instances which degrade the performance of WSOD. To address this problem, this paper introduces an end-to-end object instance mining (OIM) framework for weakly supervised object detection. OIM attempts to detect all possible object instances existing in each image by introducing information propagation on the spatial and appearance graphs, without any additional annotations. During the iterative learning process, the less discriminative object instances from the same class can be gradually detected and utilized for training. In addition, we design an object instance reweighted loss to learn larger portion of each object instance to further improve the performance. The experimental results on two publicly available databases, VOC 2007 and 2012, demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach."
Multimodal Structure-Consistent Image-to-Image Translation,"Unpaired image-to-image translation is proven quite effective in boosting a CNN-based object detector for a different domain by means of data augmentation that can well preserve the image-objects in the translated images. Recently, multimodal GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) models have been proposed and were expected to further boost the detector accuracy by generating a diverse collection of images in the target domain, given only a single/labelled image in the source domain. However, images generated by multimodal GANs would achieve even worse detection accuracy than the ones by a unimodal GAN with better object preservation. In this work, we introduce cycle-structure consistency for generating diverse and structure-preserved translated images across complex domains, such as between day and night, for object detector training. Qualitative results show that our model, Multimodal AugGAN, can generate diverse and realistic images for the target domain. For quantitative comparisons, we evaluate other competing methods and ours by using the generated images to train YOLO, Faster R-CNN and FCN models and prove that our model achieves significant improvement and outperforms other methods on the detection accuracies and the FCN scores. Also, we demonstrate that our model could provide more diverse object appearances in the target domain through comparison on the perceptual distance metric."
Fast Learning of Temporal Action Proposal via Dense Boundary Generator,"Generating temporal action proposals remains a very challenging problem, where the main issue lies in predicting precise temporal proposal boundaries and reliable action confidence in long and untrimmed real-world videos. In this paper, we propose an efficient and unified framework to generate temporal action proposals named Dense Boundary Generator (DBG), which draws inspiration from boundary-sensitive methods and implements boundary classification and action completeness regression for densely distributed proposals. In particular, the DBG consists of two modules: Temporal boundary classification (TBC) and Action-aware completeness regression (ACR). The TBC aims to provide two temporal boundary confidence maps by low-level two-stream features, while the ACR is designed to generate an action completeness score map by high-level action-aware features. Moreover, we introduce a dual stream BaseNet (DSB) to encode RGB and optical flow information, which helps to capture discriminative boundary and actionness features. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14 demonstrate the superiority of DBG over the state-of-the-art proposal generator (e.g., MGG and BMN)."
Learning to Transfer: Unsupervised Domain Translation via Meta-Learning,"Unsupervised domain translation has recently achieved impressive performance with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and sufficient (unpaired) training data. However, existing domain translation frameworks form in a disposable way where the learning experiences are ignored and the obtained model cannot be adapted to a new coming domain. In this work, we take on unsupervised domain translation problems from a meta-learning perspective. We propose a model called Meta-Translation GAN (MT-GAN) to find good initialization of translation models. In the meta-training procedure, MT-GAN is explicitly trained with a primary translation task and a synthesized dual translation task. A cycle-consistency meta-optimization objective is designed to ensure the generalization ability. We demonstrate effectiveness of our model on ten diverse two-domain translation tasks and multiple face identity translation tasks. We show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing domain translation methods when each domain contains no more than ten training samples."
Learning Cross-Aligned Latent Embeddings for Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Retrieval (ZS-CMR) is an emerging research hotspot that aims to retrieve data of new classes across different modality data. It is challenging for not only the heterogeneous distributions across different modalities, but also the inconsistent semantics across seen and unseen classes. A handful of recently proposed methods typically borrow the idea from zero-shot learning, i.e., exploiting word embeddings of class labels (i.e., class-embeddings) as common semantic space, and using generative adversarial network (GAN) to capture the underlying multimodal data structures, as well as strengthen relations between input data and semantic space to generalize across seen and unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a novel method termed Learning Cross-Aligned Latent Embeddings (LCALE) as an alternative to these GAN based methods for ZS-CMR. Unlike using the class-embeddings as the semantic space, our method seeks for a shared low-dimensional latent space of input multimodal features and class-embeddings by modality-specific variational autoencoders. Notably, we align the distributions learned from multimodal input features and from class-embeddings to construct latent embeddings that contain the essential cross-modal correlation associated with unseen classes. Effective cross-reconstruction and cross-alignment criterions are further developed to preserve class-discriminative information in latent space, which benefits the efficiency for retrieval and enable the knowledge transfer to unseen classes. We evaluate our model using four benchmark datasets on image-text retrieval tasks and one large-scale dataset on image-sketch retrieval tasks. The experimental results show that our method establishes the new state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on all datasets."
Learning to Deblur Face Images via Sketch Synthesis,"The success of existing face deblurring methods based on deep neural networks is mainly due to the large model capacity. Few algorithms have been specially designed according to the domain knowledge of face images and the physical properties of the deblurring process. In this paper, we propose an effective face deblurring algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Motivated by the conventional deblurring process which usually involves the motion blur estimation and the latent clear image restoration, the proposed algorithm first estimates motion blur by a deep CNN and then restores latent clear images with the estimated motion blur. However, estimating motion blur from blurry face images is difficult as the textures of the blurry face images are scarce. As most face images share some common global structures which can be modeled well by sketch information, we propose to learn face sketches by a deep CNN so that the sketches can help the motion blur estimation. With the estimated motion blur, we then develop an effective latent image restoration algorithm based on a deep CNN. Although involving the several components, the proposed algorithm is trained in an end-to-end fashion. We analyze the effectiveness of each component on face image deblurring and show that the proposed algorithm is able to deblur face images with favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods."
Self-Attention ConvLSTM for Spatiotemporal Prediction,"Spatiotemporal prediction is challenging due to the complex dynamic motion and appearance changes. Existing work concentrates on embedding additional cells into the standard ConvLSTM to memorize spatial appearances during the prediction. These models always rely on the convolution layers to capture the spatial dependence, which are local and inefficient. However, long-range spatial dependencies are significant for spatial applications. To extract spatial features with both global and local dependencies, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into ConvLSTM. Specifically, a novel self-attention memory (SAM) is proposed to memorize features with long-range dependencies in terms of spatial and temporal domains. Based on the self-attention, SAM can produce features by aggregating features across all positions of both the input itself and memory features with pair-wise similarity scores. Moreover, the additional memory is updated by a gating mechanism on aggregated features and an established highway with the memory of the previous time step. Therefore, through SAM, we can extract features with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we embed the SAM into a standard ConvLSTM to construct a self-attention ConvLSTM (SA-ConvLSTM) for the spatiotemporal prediction. In experiments, we apply the SA-ConvLSTM to perform frame prediction on the MovingMNIST and KTH datasets and traffic flow prediction on the TexiBJ dataset. Our SA-ConvLSTM achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets with fewer parameters and higher time efficiency than previous state-of-the-art method."
Weakly-Supervised Video Moment Retrieval via Semantic Completion Network,"Video moment retrieval is to search the moment that is most relevant to the given natural language query. Existing methods are mostly trained in a fully-supervised setting, which requires the full annotations of temporal boundary for each query. However, manually labeling the annotations is actually time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised moment retrieval framework requiring only coarse video-level annotations for training. Specifically, we devise a proposal generation module that aggregates the context information to generate and score all candidate proposals in one single pass. We then devise an algorithm that considers both exploitation and exploration to select top-K proposals. Next, we build a semantic completion module to measure the semantic similarity between the selected proposals and query, compute reward and provide feedbacks to the proposal generation module for scoring refinement. Experiments on the ActivityCaptions and Charades-STA demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Zero-Shot Learning from Adversarial Feature Residual to Compact Visual Feature,"Recently, many zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods focused on learning discriminative object features in an embedding feature space, however, the distributions of the unseen-class features learned by these methods are prone to be partly overlapped, resulting in inaccurate object recognition. Addressing this problem, we propose a novel adversarial network to synthesize compact semantic visual features for ZSL, consisting of a residual generator, a prototype predictor, and a discriminator. The residual generator is to generate the visual feature residual, which is integrated with a visual prototype predicted via the prototype predictor for synthesizing the visual feature. The discriminator is to distinguish the synthetic visual features from the real ones extracted from an existing categorization CNN. Since the generated residuals are generally numerically much smaller than the distances among all the prototypes, the distributions of the unseen-class features synthesized by the proposed network are less overlapped. In addition, considering that the visual features from categorization CNNs are generally inconsistent with their semantic features, a simple feature selection strategy is introduced for extracting more compact semantic visual features. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method could achieve a significantly better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods by ∼1.2-13.2% in most cases."
Filtration and Distillation: Enhancing Region Attention for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization,"Delicate attention of the discriminative regions plays a critical role in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC). Unfortunately, most of the existing attention models perform poorly in FGVC, due to the pivotal limitations in discriminative regions proposing and region-based feature learning. 1) The discriminative regions are predominantly located based on the filter responses over the images, which can not be directly optimized with a performance metric. 2) Existing methods train the region-based feature extractor as a one-hot classification task individually, while neglecting the knowledge from the entire object. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel “Filtration and Distillation Learning” (FDL) model to enhance the region attention of discriminate parts for FGVC. Firstly, a Filtration Learning (FL) method is put forward for discriminative part regions proposing based on the matchability between proposing and predicting. Specifically, we utilize the proposing-predicting matchability as the performance metric of Region Proposal Network (RPN), thus enable a direct optimization of RPN to filtrate most discriminative regions. Go in detail, the object-based feature learning and region-based feature learning are formulated as “teacher” and “student”, which can furnish better supervision for region-based feature learning. Accordingly, our FDL can enhance the region attention effectively, and the overall framework can be trained end-to-end without neither object nor parts annotations. Extensive experiments verify that FDL yields state-of-the-art performance under the same backbone with the most competitive approaches on several FGVC tasks."
HAL: Improved Text-Image Matching by Mitigating Visual Semantic Hubs,"The hubness problem widely exists in high-dimensional embedding space and is a fundamental source of error for cross-modal matching tasks. In this work, we study the emergence of hubs in Visual Semantic Embeddings (VSE) with application to text-image matching. We analyze the pros and cons of two widely adopted optimization objectives for training VSE and propose a novel hubness-aware loss function (Hal) that addresses previous methods' defects. Unlike (Faghri et al. 2018) which simply takes the hardest sample within a mini-batch, Hal takes all samples into account, using both local and global statistics to scale up the weights of “hubs”. We experiment our method with various configurations of model architectures and datasets. The method exhibits exceptionally good robustness and brings consistent improvement on the task of text-image matching across all settings. Specifically, under the same model architectures as (Faghri et al. 2018) and (Lee et al. 2018), by switching only the learning objective, we report a maximum R@1 improvement of 7.4% on MS-COCO and 8.3% on Flickr30k.1"
Federated Learning for Vision-and-Language Grounding Problems,"Recently, vision-and-language grounding problems, e.g., image captioning and visual question answering (VQA), has attracted extensive interests from both academic and industrial worlds. However, given the similarity of these tasks, the efforts to obtain better results by combining the merits of their algorithms are not well studied. Inspired by the recent success of federated learning, we propose a federated learning framework to obtain various types of image representations from different tasks, which are then fused together to form fine-grained image representations. The representations merge useful features from different vision-and-language grounding problems, and are thus much more powerful than the original representations alone in individual tasks. To learn such image representations, we propose the Aligning, Integrating and Mapping Network (aimNet). The aimNet is validated on three federated learning settings, which include horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. Experiments of aimNet-based federated learning framework on two representative tasks, i.e., image captioning and VQA, demonstrate the effective and universal improvements of all metrics over the baselines. In image captioning, we are able to get 14% and 13% relative gain on the task-specific metrics CIDEr and SPICE, respectively. In VQA, we could also boost the performance of strong baselines by up to 3%."
Learned Video Compression via Joint Spatial-Temporal Correlation Exploration,"Traditional video compression technologies have been developed over decades in pursuit of higher coding efficiency. Efficient temporal information representation plays a key role in video coding. Thus, in this paper, we propose to exploit the temporal correlation using both first-order optical flow and second-order flow prediction. We suggest an one-stage learning approach to encapsulate flow as quantized features from consecutive frames which is then entropy coded with adaptive contexts conditioned on joint spatial-temporal priors to exploit second-order correlations. Joint priors are embedded in autoregressive spatial neighbors, co-located hyper elements and temporal neighbors using ConvLSTM recurrently. We evaluate our approach for the low-delay scenario with High-Efficiency Video Coding (H.265/HEVC), H.264/AVC and another learned video compression method, following the common test settings. Our work offers the state-of-the-art performance, with consistent gains across all popular test sequences."
Interactive Dual Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Captioning,"Image captioning is usually built on either generation-based or retrieval-based approaches. Both ways have certain strengths but suffer from their own limitations. In this paper, we propose an Interactive Dual Generative Adversarial Network (IDGAN) for image captioning, which mutually combines the retrieval-based and generation-based methods to learn a better image captioning ensemble. IDGAN consists of two generators and two discriminators, where the generation- and retrieval-based generators mutually benefit from each other's complementary targets that are learned from two dual adversarial discriminators. Specifically, the generation- and retrieval-based generators provide improved synthetic and retrieved candidate captions with informative feedback signals from the two respective discriminators that are trained to distinguish the generated captions from the true captions and assign top rankings to true captions respectively, thus featuring the merits of both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO dataset demonstrate that the proposed IDGAN model significantly outperforms the compared methods for image captioning."
Morphing and Sampling Network for Dense Point Cloud Completion,"3D point cloud completion, the task of inferring the complete geometric shape from a partial point cloud, has been attracting attention in the community. For acquiring high-fidelity dense point clouds and avoiding uneven distribution, blurred details, or structural loss of existing methods' results, we propose a novel approach to complete the partial point cloud in two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, the approach predicts a complete but coarse-grained point cloud with a collection of parametric surface elements. Then, in the second stage, it merges the coarse-grained prediction with the input point cloud by a novel sampling algorithm. Our method utilizes a joint loss function to guide the distribution of the points. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing methods in both the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Chamfer Distance (CD)."
Multi-Task Driven Feature Models for Thermal Infrared Tracking,"Existing deep Thermal InfraRed (TIR) trackers usually use the feature models of RGB trackers for representation. However, these feature models learned on RGB images are neither effective in representing TIR objects nor taking fine-grained TIR information into consideration. To this end, we develop a multi-task framework to learn the TIR-specific discriminative features and fine-grained correlation features for TIR tracking. Specifically, we first use an auxiliary classification network to guide the generation of TIR-specific discriminative features for distinguishing the TIR objects belonging to different classes. Second, we design a fine-grained aware module to capture more subtle information for distinguishing the TIR objects belonging to the same class. These two kinds of features complement each other and recognize TIR objects in the levels of inter-class and intra-class respectively. These two feature models are learned using a multi-task matching framework and are jointly optimized on the TIR tracking task. In addition, we develop a large-scale TIR training dataset to train the network for adapting the model to the TIR domain. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm achieves a relative gain of 10% over the baseline and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. Codes and the proposed TIR dataset are available at https://github.com/QiaoLiuHit/MMNet."
Progressive Boundary Refinement Network for Temporal Action Detection,"Temporal action detection is a challenging task due to vagueness of action boundaries. To tackle this issue, we propose an end-to-end progressive boundary refinement network (PBRNet) in this paper. PBRNet belongs to the family of one-stage detectors and is equipped with three cascaded detection modules for localizing action boundary more and more precisely. Specifically, PBRNet mainly consists of coarse pyramidal detection, refined pyramidal detection, and fine-grained detection. The first two modules build two feature pyramids to perform the anchor-based detection, and the third one explores the frame-level features to refine the boundaries of each action instance. In the fined-grained detection module, three frame-level classification branches are proposed to augment the frame-level features and update the confidence scores of action instances. Evidently, PBRNet integrates the anchor-based and frame-level methods. We experimentally evaluate the proposed PBRNet and comprehensively investigate the effect of the main components. The results show PBRNet achieves the state-of-the-art detection performances on two popular benchmarks: THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet, and meanwhile possesses a high inference speed."
A Generalized Framework for Edge-Preserving and Structure-Preserving Image Smoothing,"Image smoothing is a fundamental procedure in applications of both computer vision and graphics. The required smoothing properties can be different or even contradictive among different tasks. Nevertheless, the inherent smoothing nature of one smoothing operator is usually fixed and thus cannot meet the various requirements of different applications. In this paper, a non-convex non-smooth optimization framework is proposed to achieve diverse smoothing natures where even contradictive smoothing behaviors can be achieved. To this end, we first introduce the truncated Huber penalty function which has seldom been used in image smoothing. A robust framework is then proposed. When combined with the strong flexibility of the truncated Huber penalty function, our framework is capable of a range of applications and can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in several tasks. In addition, an efficient numerical solution is provided and its convergence is theoretically guaranteed even the optimization framework is non-convex and non-smooth. The effectiveness and superior performance of our approach are validated through comprehensive experimental results in a range of applications."
Importance-Aware Semantic Segmentation in Self-Driving with Discrete Wasserstein Training,"Semantic segmentation (SS) is an important perception manner for self-driving cars and robotics, which classifies each pixel into a pre-determined class. The widely-used cross entropy (CE) loss-based deep networks has achieved significant progress w.r.t. the mean Intersection-over Union (mIoU). However, the cross entropy loss can not take the different importance of each class in an self-driving system into account. For example, pedestrians in the image should be much more important than the surrounding buildings when make a decisions in the driving, so their segmentation results are expected to be as accurate as possible. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the importance-aware inter-class correlation in a Wasserstein training framework by configuring its ground distance matrix. The ground distance matrix can be pre-defined following a priori in a specific task, and the previous importance-ignored methods can be the particular cases. From an optimization perspective, we also extend our ground metric to a linear, convex or concave increasing function w.r.t. pre-defined ground distance. We evaluate our method on CamVid and Cityscapes datasets with different backbones (SegNet, ENet, FCN and Deeplab) in a plug and play fashion. In our extenssive experiments, Wasserstein loss demonstrates superior segmentation performance on the predefined critical classes for safe-driving."
A New Dataset and Boundary-Attention Semantic Segmentation for Face Parsing,"Face parsing has recently attracted increasing interest due to its numerous application potentials, such as facial make up and facial image generation. In this paper, we make contributions on face parsing task from two aspects. First, we develop a high-efficiency framework for pixel-level face parsing annotating and construct a new large-scale Landmark guided face Parsing dataset (LaPa). It consists of more than 22,000 facial images with abundant variations in expression, pose and occlusion, and each image of LaPa is provided with an 11-category pixel-level label map and 106-point landmarks. The dataset is publicly accessible to the community for boosting the advance of face parsing.1 Second, a simple yet effective Boundary-Attention Semantic Segmentation (BASS) method is proposed for face parsing, which contains a three-branch network with elaborately developed loss functions to fully exploit the boundary information. Extensive experiments on our LaPa benchmark and the public Helen dataset show the superiority of our proposed method."
Learning Cross-Modal Context Graph for Visual Grounding,"Visual grounding is a ubiquitous building block in many vision-language tasks and yet remains challenging due to large variations in visual and linguistic features of grounding entities, strong context effect and the resulting semantic ambiguities. Prior works typically focus on learning representations of individual phrases with limited context information. To address their limitations, this paper proposes a language-guided graph representation to capture the global context of grounding entities and their relations, and develop a cross-modal graph matching strategy for the multiple-phrase visual grounding task. In particular, we introduce a modular graph neural network to compute context-aware representations of phrases and object proposals respectively via message propagation, followed by a graph-based matching module to generate globally consistent localization of grounding phrases. We train the entire graph neural network jointly in a two-stage strategy and evaluate it on the Flickr30K Entities benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the prior state of the arts by a sizable margin, evidencing the efficacy of our grounding framework. Code is available at https://github.com/youngfly11/LCMCG-PyTorch."
CBNet: A Novel Composite Backbone Network Architecture for Object Detection,"In existing CNN based detectors, the backbone network is a very important component for basic feature1 extraction, and the performance of the detectors highly depends on it. In this paper, we aim to achieve better detection performance by building a more powerful backbone from existing ones like ResNet and ResNeXt. Specifically, we propose a novel strategy for assembling multiple identical backbones by composite connections between the adjacent backbones, to form a more powerful backbone named Composite Backbone Network (CBNet). In this way, CBNet iteratively feeds the output features of the previous backbone, namely high-level features, as part of input features to the succeeding backbone, in a stage-by-stage fashion, and finally the feature maps of the last backbone (named Lead Backbone) are used for object detection. We show that CBNet can be very easily integrated into most state-of-the-art detectors and significantly improve their performances. For example, it boosts the mAP of FPN, Mask R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN on the COCO dataset by about 1.5 to 3.0 points. Moreover, experimental results show that the instance segmentation results can be improved as well. Specifically, by simply integrating the proposed CBNet into the baseline detector Cascade Mask R-CNN, we achieve a new state-of-the-art result on COCO dataset (mAP of 53.3) with a single model, which demonstrates great effectiveness of the proposed CBNet architecture. Code will be made available at https://github.com/PKUbahuangliuhe/CBNet."
Separate in Latent Space: Unsupervised Single Image Layer Separation,"Many real world vision tasks, such as reflection removal from a transparent surface and intrinsic image decomposition, can be modeled as single image layer separation. However, this problem is highly ill-posed, requiring accurately aligned and hard to collect triplet data to train the CNN models. To address this problem, this paper proposes an unsupervised method that requires no ground truth data triplet in training. At the core of the method are two assumptions about data distributions in the latent spaces of different layers, based on which a novel unsupervised layer separation pipeline can be derived. Then the method can be constructed based on the GANs framework with self-supervision and cycle consistency constraints, etc. Experimental results demonstrate its successfulness in outperforming existing unsupervised methods in both synthetic and real world tasks. The method also shows its ability to solve a more challenging multi-layer separation task."
TEINet: Towards an Efficient Architecture for Video Recognition,"Efficiency is an important issue in designing video architectures for action recognition. 3D CNNs have witnessed remarkable progress in action recognition from videos. However, compared with their 2D counterparts, 3D convolutions often introduce a large amount of parameters and cause high computational cost. To relieve this problem, we propose an efficient temporal module, termed as Temporal Enhancement-and-Interaction (TEI Module), which could be plugged into the existing 2D CNNs (denoted by TEINet). The TEI module presents a different paradigm to learn temporal features by decoupling the modeling of channel correlation and temporal interaction. First, it contains a Motion Enhanced Module (MEM) which is to enhance the motion-related features while suppress irrelevant information (e.g., background). Then, it introduces a Temporal Interaction Module (TIM) which supplements the temporal contextual information in a channel-wise manner. This two-stage modeling scheme is not only able to capture temporal structure flexibly and effectively, but also efficient for model inference. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of TEINet on several benchmarks (e.g., Something-Something V1&V2, Kinetics, UCF101 and HMDB51). Our proposed TEINet can achieve a good recognition accuracy on these datasets but still preserve a high efficiency."
TANet: Robust 3D Object Detection from Point Clouds with Triple Attention,"In this paper, we focus on exploring the robustness of the 3D object detection in point clouds, which has been rarely discussed in existing approaches. We observe two crucial phenomena: 1) the detection accuracy of the hard objects, e.g., Pedestrians, is unsatisfactory, 2) when adding additional noise points, the performance of existing approaches decreases rapidly. To alleviate these problems, a novel TANet is introduced in this paper, which mainly contains a Triple Attention (TA) module, and a Coarse-to-Fine Regression (CFR) module. By considering the channel-wise, point-wise and voxel-wise attention jointly, the TA module enhances the crucial information of the target while suppresses the unstable cloud points. Besides, the novel stacked TA further exploits the multi-level feature attention. In addition, the CFR module boosts the accuracy of localization without excessive computation cost. Experimental results on the validation set of KITTI dataset demonstrate that, in the challenging noisy cases, i.e., adding additional random noisy points around each object, the presented approach goes far beyond state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, for the 3D object detection task of the KITTI benchmark, our approach ranks the first place on Pedestrian class, by using the point clouds as the only input. The running speed is around 29 frames per second."
Training-Time-Friendly Network for Real-Time Object Detection,"Modern object detectors can rarely achieve short training time, fast inference speed, and high accuracy at the same time. To strike a balance among them, we propose the Training-Time-Friendly Network (TTFNet). In this work, we start with light-head, single-stage, and anchor-free designs, which enable fast inference speed. Then, we focus on shortening training time. We notice that encoding more training samples from annotated boxes plays a similar role as increasing batch size, which helps enlarge the learning rate and accelerate the training process. To this end, we introduce a novel approach using Gaussian kernels to encode training samples. Besides, we design the initiative sample weights for better information utilization. Experiments on MS COCO show that our TTFNet has great advantages in balancing training time, inference speed, and accuracy. It has reduced training time by more than seven times compared to previous real-time detectors while maintaining state-of-the-art performances. In addition, our super-fast version of TTFNet-18 and TTFNet-53 can outperform SSD300 and YOLOv3 by less than one-tenth of their training time, respectively. The code has been made available at https://github.com/ZJULearning/ttfnet."
Hybrid Graph Neural Networks for Crowd Counting,"Crowd counting is an important yet challenging task due to the large scale and density variation. Recent investigations have shown that distilling rich relations among multi-scale features and exploiting useful information from the auxiliary task, i.e., localization, are vital for this task. Nevertheless, how to comprehensively leverage these relations within a unified network architecture is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel network structure called Hybrid Graph Neural Network (HyGnn) which targets to relieve the problem by interweaving the multi-scale features for crowd density as well as its auxiliary task (localization) together and performing joint reasoning over a graph. Specifically, HyGnn integrates a hybrid graph to jointly represent the task-specific feature maps of different scales as nodes, and two types of relations as edges: (i) multi-scale relations capturing the feature dependencies across scales and (ii) mutual beneficial relations building bridges for the cooperation between counting and localization. Thus, through message passing, HyGnn can capture and distill richer relations between nodes to obtain more powerful representations, providing robust and accurate results. Our HyGnn performs significantly well on four challenging datasets: ShanghaiTech Part A, ShanghaiTech Part B, UCF_CC_50 and UCF_QNRF, outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin."
Video Cloze Procedure for Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Learning,"We propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as Video Cloze Procedure (VCP), to learn rich spatial-temporal representations. VCP first generates “blanks” by withholding video clips and then creates “options” by applying spatio-temporal operations on the withheld clips. Finally, it fills the blanks with “options” and learns representations by predicting the categories of operations applied on the clips. VCP can act as either a proxy task or a target task in self-supervised learning. As a proxy task, it converts rich self-supervised representations into video clip operations (options), which enhances the flexibility and reduces the complexity of representation learning. As a target task, it can assess learned representation models in a uniform and interpretable manner. With VCP, we train spatial-temporal representation models (3D-CNNs) and apply such models on action recognition and video retrieval tasks. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks show that the trained models outperform the state-of-the-art self-supervised models with significant margins."
Context-Aware Zero-Shot Recognition,"We present a novel problem setting in zero-shot learning, zero-shot object recognition and detection in the context. Contrary to the traditional zero-shot learning methods, which simply infers unseen categories by transferring knowledge from the objects belonging to semantically similar seen categories, we aim to understand the identity of the novel objects in an image surrounded by the known objects using the inter-object relation prior. Specifically, we leverage the visual context and the geometric relationships between all pairs of objects in a single image, and capture the information useful to infer unseen categories. We integrate our context-aware zero-shot learning framework into the traditional zero-shot learning techniques seamlessly using a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both zero-shot region classification and zero-shot detection tasks. The results on Visual Genome (VG) dataset show that our model significantly boosts performance with the additional visual context compared to traditional methods."
Learning Saliency-Free Model with Generic Features for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Current weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods often estimate initial supervision from class activation maps (CAM), which produce sparse discriminative object seeds and rely on image saliency to provide background cues when only class labels are used. To eliminate the demand of extra data for training saliency detector, we propose to discover class pattern inherent in the lower layer convolution features, which are scarcely explored as in previous CAM methods. Specifically, we first project the convolution features into a low-dimension space and then decide on a decision boundary to generate class-agnostic maps for each semantic category that exists in the image. Features from Lower layer are more generic, thus capable of generating proxy ground-truth with more accurate and integral objects. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that the proposed saliency-free method outperforms the previous approaches under the same weakly-supervised setting and achieves superior segmentation results, which are 64.5% on the validation set and 64.6% on the test set concerning mIoU metric."
An Integrated Enhancement Solution for 24-Hour Colorful Imaging,"The current industry practice for 24-hour outdoor imaging is to use a silicon camera supplemented with near-infrared (NIR) illumination. This will result in color images with poor contrast at daytime and absence of chrominance at nighttime. For this dilemma, all existing solutions try to capture RGB and NIR images separately. However, they need additional hardware support and suffer from various drawbacks, including short service life, high price, specific usage scenario, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel and integrated enhancement solution that produces clear color images, whether at abundant sunlight daytime or extremely low-light nighttime. Our key idea is to separate the VIS and NIR information from mixed signals, and enhance the VIS signal adaptively with the NIR signal as assistance. To this end, we build an optical system to collect a new VIS-NIR-MIX dataset and present a physically meaningful image processing algorithm based on CNN. Extensive experiments show outstanding results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution."
Fine-Grained Fashion Similarity Learning by Attribute-Specific Embedding Network,"This paper strives to learn fine-grained fashion similarity. In this similarity paradigm, one should pay more attention to the similarity in terms of a specific design/attribute among fashion items, which has potential values in many fashion related applications such as fashion copyright protection. To this end, we propose an Attribute-Specific Embedding Network (ASEN) to jointly learn multiple attribute-specific embeddings in an end-to-end manner, thus measure the fine-grained similarity in the corresponding space. With two attention modules, i.e., Attribute-aware Spatial Attention and Attribute-aware Channel Attention, ASEN is able to locate the related regions and capture the essential patterns under the guidance of the specified attribute, thus make the learned attribute-specific embeddings better reflect the fine-grained similarity. Extensive experiments on four fashion-related datasets show the effectiveness of ASEN for fine-grained fashion similarity learning and its potential for fashion reranking. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Maryeon/asen."
Domain Generalization Using a Mixture of Multiple Latent Domains,"When domains, which represent underlying data distributions, vary during training and testing processes, deep neural networks suffer a drop in their performance. Domain generalization allows improvements in the generalization performance for unseen target domains by using multiple source domains. Conventional methods assume that the domain to which each sample belongs is known in training. However, many datasets, such as those collected via web crawling, contain a mixture of multiple latent domains, in which the domain of each sample is unknown. This paper introduces domain generalization using a mixture of multiple latent domains as a novel and more realistic scenario, where we try to train a domain-generalized model without using domain labels. To address this scenario, we propose a method that iteratively divides samples into latent domains via clustering, and which trains the domain-invariant feature extractor shared among the divided latent domains via adversarial learning. We assume that the latent domain of images is reflected in their style, and thus, utilize style features for clustering. By using these features, our proposed method successfully discovers latent domains and achieves domain generalization even if the domain labels are not given. Experiments show that our proposed method can train a domain-generalized model without using domain labels. Moreover, it outperforms conventional domain generalization methods, including those that utilize domain labels."
High-Order Residual Network for Light Field Super-Resolution,"Plenoptic cameras usually sacrifice the spatial resolution of their SAIs to acquire geometry information from different viewpoints. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate such spatio-angular trade-off, but seldom make use of the structural properties of the light field (LF) data efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel high-order residual network to learn the geometric features hierarchically from the LF for reconstruction. An important component in the proposed network is the high-order residual block (HRB), which learns the local geometric features by considering the information from all input views. After fully obtaining the local features learned from each HRB, our model extracts the representative geometric features for spatio-angular upsampling through the global residual learning. Additionally, a refinement network is followed to further enhance the spatial details by minimizing a perceptual loss. Compared with previous work, our model is tailored to the rich structure inherent in the LF, and therefore can reduce the artifacts near non-Lambertian and occlusion regions. Experimental results show that our approach enables high-quality reconstruction even in challenging regions and outperforms state-of-the-art single image or LF reconstruction methods with both quantitative measurements and visual evaluation."
Shallow Feature Based Dense Attention Network for Crowd Counting,"While the performance of crowd counting via deep learning has been improved dramatically in the recent years, it remains an ingrained problem due to cluttered backgrounds and varying scales of people within an image. In this paper, we propose a Shallow feature based Dense Attention Network (SDANet) for crowd counting from still images, which diminishes the impact of backgrounds via involving a shallow feature based attention model, and meanwhile, captures multi-scale information via densely connecting hierarchical image features. Specifically, inspired by the observation that backgrounds and human crowds generally have noticeably different responses in shallow features, we decide to build our attention model upon shallow-feature maps, which results in accurate background-pixel detection. Moreover, considering that the most representative features of people across different scales can appear in different layers of a feature extraction network, to better keep them all, we propose to densely connect hierarchical image features of different layers and subsequently encode them for estimating crowd density. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of SDANet when dealing with different scenarios. Particularly, on the challenging UCF_CC_50 dataset, our method outperforms other existing methods by a large margin, as is evident from a remarkable 11.9% Mean Absolute Error (MAE) drop of our SDANet."
Learning to Follow Directions in Street View,"Navigating and understanding the real world remains a key challenge in machine learning and inspires a great variety of research in areas such as language grounding, planning, navigation and computer vision. We propose an instruction-following task that requires all of the above, and which combines the practicality of simulated environments with the challenges of ambiguous, noisy real world data. StreetNav is built on top of Google Street View and provides visually accurate environments representing real places. Agents are given driving instructions which they must learn to interpret in order to successfully navigate in this environment. Since humans equipped with driving instructions can readily navigate in previously unseen cities, we set a high bar and test our trained agents for similar cognitive capabilities. Although deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods are frequently evaluated only on data that closely follow the training distribution, our dataset extends to multiple cities and has a clean train/test separation. This allows for thorough testing of generalisation ability. This paper presents the StreetNav environment and tasks, models that establish strong baselines, and extensive analysis of the task and the trained agents."
Pyramid Attention Aggregation Network for Semantic Segmentation of Surgical Instruments,"Semantic segmentation of surgical instruments plays a critical role in computer-assisted surgery. However, specular reflection and scale variation of instruments are likely to occur in the surgical environment, undesirably altering visual features of instruments, such as color and shape. These issues make semantic segmentation of surgical instruments more challenging. In this paper, a novel network, Pyramid Attention Aggregation Network, is proposed to aggregate multi-scale attentive features for surgical instruments. It contains two critical modules: Double Attention Module and Pyramid Upsampling Module. Specifically, the Double Attention Module includes two attention blocks (i.e., position attention block and channel attention block), which model semantic dependencies between positions and channels by capturing joint semantic information and global contexts, respectively. The attentive features generated by the Double Attention Module can distinguish target regions, contributing to solving the specular reflection issue. Moreover, the Pyramid Upsampling Module extracts local details and global contexts by aggregating multi-scale attentive features. It learns the shape and size features of surgical instruments in different receptive fields and thus addresses the scale variation issue. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. It achieves a new record of 97.10% mean IOU on Cata7. Besides, it comes first in the MICCAI EndoVis Challenge 2017 with 9.90% increase on mean IOU."
Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Scale Mixture Modeling for Foreground Estimation,"Subtracting the backgrounds from the video frames is an important step for many video analysis applications. Assuming that the backgrounds are low-rank and the foregrounds are sparse, the robust principle component analysis (RPCA)-based methods have shown promising results. However, the RPCA-based methods suffered from the scale issue, i.e., the ℓ1-sparsity regularizer fails to model the varying sparsity of the moving objects. While several efforts have been made to address this issue with advanced sparse models, previous methods cannot fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations among the foregrounds. In this paper, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal Gaussian scale mixture (STGSM) model for foreground estimation. In the proposed STGSM model, a temporal consistent constraint is imposed over the estimated foregrounds through nonzero-means Gaussian models. Specifically, the estimates of the foregrounds obtained in the previous frame are used as the prior for these of the current frame, and nonzero means Gaussian scale mixture models (GSM) are developed. To better characterize the temporal correlations, the optical flow has been used to model the correspondences between foreground pixels in adjacent frames. The spatial correlations have also been exploited by considering that local correlated pixels should be characterized by the same STGSM model, leading to further performance improvements. Experimental results on real video datasets show that the proposed method performs comparably or even better than current state-of-the-art background subtraction methods."
Crowd Counting with Decomposed Uncertainty,"Research in neural networks in the field of computer vision has achieved remarkable accuracy for point estimation. However, the uncertainty in the estimation is rarely addressed. Uncertainty quantification accompanied by point estimation can lead to a more informed decision, and even improve the prediction quality. In this work, we focus on uncertainty estimation in the domain of crowd counting. With increasing occurrences of heavily crowded events such as political rallies, protests, concerts, etc., automated crowd analysis is becoming an increasingly crucial task. The stakes can be very high in many of these real-world applications. We propose a scalable neural network framework with quantification of decomposed uncertainty using a bootstrap ensemble. We demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty quantification method provides additional insight to the crowd counting problem and is simple to implement. We also show that our proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art performances in many benchmark crowd counting datasets."
Image Formation Model Guided Deep Image Super-Resolution,"We present a simple and effective image super-resolution algorithm that imposes an image formation constraint on the deep neural networks via pixel substitution. The proposed algorithm first uses a deep neural network to estimate intermediate high-resolution images, blurs the intermediate images using known blur kernels, and then substitutes values of the pixels at the un-decimated positions with those of the corresponding pixels from the low-resolution images. The output of the pixel substitution process strictly satisfies the image formation model and is further refined by the same deep neural network in a cascaded manner. The proposed framework is trained in an end-to-end fashion and can work with existing feed-forward deep neural networks for super-resolution and converges fast in practice. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods."
Adversarial Cross-Domain Action Recognition with Co-Attention,"Action recognition has been a widely studied topic with a heavy focus on supervised learning involving sufficient labeled videos. However, the problem of cross-domain action recognition, where training and testing videos are drawn from different underlying distributions, remains largely under-explored. Previous methods directly employ techniques for cross-domain image recognition, which tend to suffer from the severe temporal misalignment problem. This paper proposes a Temporal Co-attention Network (TCoN), which matches the distributions of temporally aligned action features between source and target domains using a novel cross-domain co-attention mechanism. Experimental results on three cross-domain action recognition datasets demonstrate that TCoN improves both previous single-domain and cross-domain methods significantly under the cross-domain setting."
Further Understanding Videos through Adverbs: A New Video Task,"Video understanding is a research hotspot of computer vision and significant progress has been made on video action recognition recently. However, the semantics information contained in actions is not rich enough to build powerful video understanding models. This paper first introduces a new video semantics: the Behavior Adverb (BA), which is a more expressive and difficult one covering subtle and inherent characteristics of human action behavior. To exhaustively decode this semantics, we construct the Videos with Action and Adverb Dataset (VAAD), which is a large-scale dataset with a semantically complete set of BAs. The dataset will be released to the public with this paper. We benchmark several representative video understanding methods (originally for action recognition) on BA and action recognition. The results show that BA recognition task is more challenging than conventional action recognition. Accordingly, we propose the BA Understanding Network (BAUN) to solve this problem and the experiments reveal that our BAUN is more suitable for BA recognition (11% better than I3D). Furthermore, we find these two semantics (action and BA) can propel each other forward to better performance: promoting action recognition results by 3.4% averagely on three standard action recognition datasets (UCF-101, HMDB-51, Kinetics)."
Visual Dialogue State Tracking for Question Generation,"GuessWhat?! is a visual dialogue task between a guesser and an oracle. The guesser aims to locate an object supposed by the oracle oneself in an image by asking a sequence of Yes/No questions. Asking proper questions with the progress of dialogue is vital for achieving successful final guess. As a result, the progress of dialogue should be properly represented and tracked. Previous models for question generation pay less attention on the representation and tracking of dialogue states, and therefore are prone to asking low quality questions such as repeated questions. This paper proposes visual dialogue state tracking (VDST) based method for question generation. A visual dialogue state is defined as the distribution on objects in the image as well as representations of objects. Representations of objects are updated with the change of the distribution on objects. An object-difference based attention is used to decode new question. The distribution on objects is updated by comparing the question-answer pair and objects. Experimental results on GuessWhat?! dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. It is also noticeable that our model reduces the rate of repeated questions from more than 50% to 21.9% compared with previous state-of-the-art methods."
Relation Network for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (reID) aims at retrieving an image of the person of interest from a set of images typically captured by multiple cameras. Recent reID methods have shown that exploiting local features describing body parts, together with a global feature of a person image itself, gives robust feature representations, even in the case of missing body parts. However, using the individual part-level features directly, without considering relations between body parts, confuses differentiating identities of different persons having similar attributes in corresponding parts. To address this issue, we propose a new relation network for person reID that considers relations between individual body parts and the rest of them. Our model makes a single part-level feature incorporate partial information of other body parts as well, supporting it to be more discriminative. We also introduce a global contrastive pooling (GCP) method to obtain a global feature of a person image. We propose to use contrastive features for GCP to complement conventional max and averaging pooling techniques. We show that our model outperforms the state of the art on the Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on discriminative person representations."
Explanation vs Attention: A Two-Player Game to Obtain Attention for VQA,"In this paper, we aim to obtain improved attention for a visual question answering (VQA) task. It is challenging to provide supervision for attention. An observation we make is that visual explanations as obtained through class activation mappings (specifically Grad-CAM) that are meant to explain the performance of various networks could form a means of supervision. However, as the distributions of attention maps and that of Grad-CAMs differ, it would not be suitable to directly use these as a form of supervision. Rather, we propose the use of a discriminator that aims to distinguish samples of visual explanation and attention maps. The use of adversarial training of the attention regions as a two-player game between attention and explanation serves to bring the distributions of attention maps and visual explanations closer. Significantly, we observe that providing such a means of supervision also results in attention maps that are more closely related to human attention resulting in a substantial improvement over baseline stacked attention network (SAN) models. It also results in a good improvement in rank correlation metric on the VQA task. This method can also be combined with recent MCB based methods and results in consistent improvement. We also provide comparisons with other means for learning distributions such as based on Correlation Alignment (Coral), Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Mean Square Error (MSE) losses and observe that the adversarial loss outperforms the other forms of learning the attention maps. Visualization of the results also confirms our hypothesis that attention maps improve using this form of supervision."
LCD: Learned Cross-Domain Descriptors for 2D-3D Matching,"In this work, we present a novel method to learn a local cross-domain descriptor for 2D image and 3D point cloud matching. Our proposed method is a dual auto-encoder neural network that maps 2D and 3D input into a shared latent space representation. We show that such local cross-domain descriptors in the shared embedding are more discriminative than those obtained from individual training in 2D and 3D domains. To facilitate the training process, we built a new dataset by collecting  ≈ 1.4 millions of 2D-3D correspondences with various lighting conditions and settings from publicly available RGB-D scenes. Our descriptor is evaluated in three main experiments: 2D-3D matching, cross-domain retrieval, and sparse-to-dense depth estimation. Experimental results confirm the robustness of our approach as well as its competitive performance not only in solving cross-domain tasks but also in being able to generalize to solve sole 2D and 3D tasks. Our dataset and code are released publicly at https://hkust-vgd.github.io/lcd."
Exploit and Replace: An Asymmetrical Two-Stream Architecture for Versatile Light Field Saliency Detection,"Light field saliency detection is becoming of increasing interest in recent years due to the significant improvements in challenging scenes by using abundant light field cues. However, high dimension of light field data poses computation-intensive and memory-intensive challenges, and light field data access is far less ubiquitous as RGB data. These may severely impede practical applications of light field saliency detection. In this paper, we introduce an asymmetrical two-stream architecture inspired by knowledge distillation to confront these challenges. First, we design a teacher network to learn to exploit focal slices for higher requirements on desktop computers and meanwhile transfer comprehensive focusness knowledge to the student network. Our teacher network is achieved relying on two tailor-made modules, namely multi-focusness recruiting module (MFRM) and multi-focusness screening module (MFSM), respectively. Second, we propose two distillation schemes to train a student network towards memory and computation efficiency while ensuring the performance. The proposed distillation schemes ensure better absorption of focusness knowledge and enable the student to replace the focal slices with a single RGB image in an user-friendly way. We conduct the experiments on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our teacher network achieves state-of-the-arts performance and student network (ResNet18) achieves Top-1 accuracies on HFUT-LFSD dataset and Top-4 on DUT-LFSD, which tremendously minimizes the model size by 56% and boosts the Frame Per Second (FPS) by 159%, compared with the best performing method."
Differentiable Grammars for Videos,"This paper proposes a novel algorithm which learns a formal regular grammar from real-world continuous data, such as videos. Learning latent terminals, non-terminals, and production rules directly from continuous data allows the construction of a generative model capturing sequential structures with multiple possibilities. Our model is fully differentiable, and provides easily interpretable results which are important in order to understand the learned structures. It outperforms the state-of-the-art on several challenging datasets and is more accurate for forecasting future activities in videos. We plan to open-source the code.1"
Region-Adaptive Dense Network for Efficient Motion Deblurring,"In this paper, we address the problem of dynamic scene deblurring in the presence of motion blur. Restoration of images affected by severe blur necessitates a network design with a large receptive field, which existing networks attempt to achieve through simple increment in the number of generic convolution layers, kernel-size, or the scales at which the image is processed. However, these techniques ignore the non-uniform nature of blur, and they come at the expense of an increase in model size and inference time. We present a new architecture composed of region adaptive dense deformable modules that implicitly discover the spatially varying shifts responsible for non-uniform blur in the input image and learn to modulate the filters. This capability is complemented by a self-attentive module which captures non-local spatial relationships among the intermediate features and enhances the spatially varying processing capability. We incorporate these modules into a densely connected encoder-decoder design which utilizes pre-trained Densenet filters to further improve the performance. Our network facilitates interpretable modeling of the spatially-varying deblurring process while dispensing with multi-scale processing and large filters entirely. Extensive comparisons with prior art on benchmark dynamic scene deblurring datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks via significant improvements in accuracy and speed, enabling almost real-time deblurring."
Visualizing Deep Networks by Optimizing with Integrated Gradients,"Understanding and interpreting the decisions made by deep learning models is valuable in many domains. In computer vision, computing heatmaps from a deep network is a popular approach for visualizing and understanding deep networks. However, heatmaps that do not correlate with the network may mislead human, hence the performance of heatmaps in providing a faithful explanation to the underlying deep network is crucial. In this paper, we propose I-GOS, which optimizes for a heatmap so that the classification scores on the masked image would maximally decrease. The main novelty of the approach is to compute descent directions based on the integrated gradients instead of the normal gradient, which avoids local optima and speeds up convergence. Compared with previous approaches, our method can flexibly compute heatmaps at any resolution for different user needs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the heatmaps produced by our approach are more correlated with the decision of the underlying deep network, in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches."
Text Perceptron: Towards End-to-End Arbitrary-Shaped Text Spotting,"Many approaches have recently been proposed to detect irregular scene text and achieved promising results. However, their localization results may not well satisfy the following text recognition part mainly because of two reasons: 1) recognizing arbitrary shaped text is still a challenging task, and 2) prevalent non-trainable pipeline strategies between text detection and text recognition will lead to suboptimal performances. To handle this incompatibility problem, in this paper we propose an end-to-end trainable text spotting approach named Text Perceptron. Concretely, Text Perceptron first employs an efficient segmentation-based text detector that learns the latent text reading order and boundary information. Then a novel Shape Transform Module (abbr. STM) is designed to transform the detected feature regions into regular morphologies without extra parameters. It unites text detection and the following recognition part into a whole framework, and helps the whole network achieve global optimization. Experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on two standard text benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2015, and also obviously outperforms existing methods on irregular text benchmarks SCUT-CTW1500 and Total-Text."
FFA-Net: Feature Fusion Attention Network for Single Image Dehazing,"In this paper, we propose an end-to-end feature fusion at-tention network (FFA-Net) to directly restore the haze-free image. The FFA-Net architecture consists of three key components:1) A novel Feature Attention (FA) module combines Channel Attention with Pixel Attention mechanism, considering that different channel-wise features contain totally different weighted information and haze distribution is uneven on the different image pixels. FA treats different features and pixels unequally, which provides additional flexibility in dealing with different types of information, expanding the representational ability of CNNs. 2) A basic block structure consists of Local Residual Learning and Feature Attention, Local Residual Learning allowing the less important information such as thin haze region or low-frequency to be bypassed through multiple local residual connections, let main network architecture focus on more effective information. 3) An Attention-based different levels Feature Fusion (FFA) structure, the feature weights are adaptively learned from the Feature Attention (FA) module, giving more weight to important features. This structure can also retain the information of shallow layers and pass it into deep layers.The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FFA-Net surpasses previous state-of-the-art single image dehazing methods by a very large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, boosting the best published PSNR metric from 30.23 dB to 36.39 dB on the SOTS indoor test dataset. Code has been made available at GitHub."
Learning Meta Model for Zero- and Few-Shot Face Anti-Spoofing,"Face anti-spoofing is crucial to the security of face recognition systems. Most previous methods formulate face anti-spoofing as a supervised learning problem to detect various predefined presentation attacks, which need large scale training data to cover as many attacks as possible. However, the trained model is easy to overfit several common attacks and is still vulnerable to unseen attacks. To overcome this challenge, the detector should: 1) learn discriminative features that can generalize to unseen spoofing types from predefined presentation attacks; 2) quickly adapt to new spoofing types by learning from both the predefined attacks and a few examples of the new spoofing types. Therefore, we define face anti-spoofing as a zero- and few-shot learning problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Inner-update Meta Face Anti-Spoofing (AIM-FAS) method to tackle this problem through meta-learning. Specifically, AIM-FAS trains a meta-learner focusing on the task of detecting unseen spoofing types by learning from predefined living and spoofing faces and a few examples of new attacks. To assess the proposed approach, we propose several benchmarks for zero- and few-shot FAS. Experiments show its superior performances on the presented benchmarks to existing methods in existing zero-shot FAS protocols."
DGCN: Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network for Efficient Multi-Person Pose Estimation,"Multi-person pose estimation aims to detect human keypoints from images with multiple persons. Bottom-up methods for multi-person pose estimation have attracted extensive attention, owing to the good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Recent bottom-up methods usually follow the principle of keypoints localization and grouping, where relations between keypoints are the keys to group keypoints. These relations spontaneously construct a graph of keypoints, where the edges represent the relations between two nodes (i.e., keypoints). Existing bottom-up methods mainly define relations by empirically picking out edges from this graph, while omitting edges that may contain useful semantic relations. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Graph Convolutional Module (DGCM) to model rich relations in the keypoints graph. Specifically, we take into account all relations (all edges of the graph) and construct dynamic graphs to tolerate large variations of human pose. The DGCM is quite lightweight, which allows it to be stacked like a pyramid architecture and learn structural relations from multi-level features. Our network with single DGCM based on ResNet-50 achieves relative gains of 3.2% and 4.8% over state-of-the-art bottom-up methods on COCO keypoints and MPII dataset, respectively."
Improved Visual-Semantic Alignment for Zero-Shot Object Detection,"Zero-shot object detection is an emerging research topic that aims to recognize and localize previously ‘unseen’ objects. This setting gives rise to several unique challenges, e.g., highly imbalanced positive vs. negative instance ratio, proper alignment between visual and semantic concepts and the ambiguity between background and unseen classes. Here, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework underpinned by a novel loss function that handles class-imbalance and seeks to properly align the visual and semantic cues for improved zero-shot learning. We call our objective the ‘Polarity loss’ because it explicitly maximizes the gap between positive and negative predictions. Such a margin maximizing formulation is not only important for visual-semantic alignment but it also resolves the ambiguity between background and unseen objects. Further, the semantic representations of objects are noisy, thus complicating the alignment between visual and semantic domains. To this end, we perform metric learning using a ‘Semantic vocabulary’ of related concepts that refines the noisy semantic embeddings and establishes a better synergy between visual and semantic domains. Our approach is inspired by the embodiment theories in cognitive science, that claim human semantic understanding to be grounded in past experiences (seen objects), related linguistic concepts (word vocabulary) and the visual perception (seen/unseen object images). Our extensive results on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets show significant improvements over state of the art.1"
Dynamic Graph Representation for Occlusion Handling in Biometrics,"The generalization ability of Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for biometrics drops greatly due to the adverse effects of various occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel unified framework integrated the merits of both CNNs and graphical models to learn dynamic graph representations for occlusion problems in biometrics, called Dynamic Graph Representation (DGR). Convolutional features onto certain regions are re-crafted by a graph generator to establish the connections among the spatial parts of biometrics and build Feature Graphs based on these node representations. Each node of Feature Graphs corresponds to a specific part of the input image and the edges express the spatial relationships between parts. By analyzing the similarities between the nodes, the framework is able to adaptively remove the nodes representing the occluded parts. During dynamic graph matching, we propose a novel strategy to measure the distances of both nodes and adjacent matrixes. In this way, the proposed method is more convincing than CNNs-based methods because the dynamic graph method implies a more illustrative and reasonable inference of the biometrics decision. Experiments conducted on iris and face demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which boosts the accuracy of occluded biometrics recognition by a large margin comparing with baseline methods."
Conquering the CNN Over-Parameterization Dilemma: A Volterra Filtering Approach for Action Recognition,"The importance of inference in Machine Learning (ML) has led to an explosive number of different proposals in ML, and particularly in Deep Learning. In an attempt to reduce the complexity of Convolutional Neural Networks, we propose a Volterra filter-inspired Network architecture. This architecture introduces controlled non-linearities in the form of interactions between the delayed input samples of data. We propose a cascaded implementation of Volterra Filtering so as to significantly reduce the number of parameters required to carry out the same classification task as that of a conventional Neural Network. We demonstrate an efficient parallel implementation of this Volterra Neural Network (VNN), along with its remarkable performance while retaining a relatively simpler and potentially more tractable structure. Furthermore, we show a rather sophisticated adaptation of this network to nonlinearly fuse the RGB (spatial) information and the Optical Flow (temporal) information of a video sequence for action recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets for action recognition, and is shown to outperform state of the art CNN approaches."
Hidden Trigger Backdoor Attacks,"With the success of deep learning algorithms in various domains, studying adversarial attacks to secure deep models in real world applications has become an important research topic. Backdoor attacks are a form of adversarial attacks on deep networks where the attacker provides poisoned data to the victim to train the model with, and then activates the attack by showing a specific small trigger pattern at the test time. Most state-of-the-art backdoor attacks either provide mislabeled poisoning data that is possible to identify by visual inspection, reveal the trigger in the poisoned data, or use noise to hide the trigger. We propose a novel form of backdoor attack where poisoned data look natural with correct labels and also more importantly, the attacker hides the trigger in the poisoned data and keeps the trigger secret until the test time. We perform an extensive study on various image classification settings and show that our attack can fool the model by pasting the trigger at random locations on unseen images although the model performs well on clean data. We also show that our proposed attack cannot be easily defended using a state-of-the-art defense algorithm for backdoor attacks."
Temporal Interlacing Network,"For a long time, the vision community tries to learn the spatio-temporal representation by combining convolutional neural network together with various temporal models, such as the families of Markov chain, optical flow, RNN and temporal convolution. However, these pipelines consume enormous computing resources due to the alternately learning process for spatial and temporal information. One natural question is whether we can embed the temporal information into the spatial one so the information in the two domains can be jointly learned once-only. In this work, we answer this question by presenting a simple yet powerful operator – temporal interlacing network (TIN). Instead of learning the temporal features, TIN fuses the two kinds of information by interlacing spatial representations from the past to the future, and vice versa. A differentiable interlacing target can be learned to control the interlacing process. In this way, a heavy temporal model is replaced by a simple interlacing operator. We theoretically prove that with a learnable interlacing target, TIN performs equivalently to the regularized temporal convolution network (r-TCN), but gains 4% more accuracy with 6x less latency on 6 challenging benchmarks. These results push the state-of-the-art performances of video understanding by a considerable margin. Not surprising, the ensemble model of the proposed TIN won the 1st place in the ICCV19 - Multi Moments in Time challenge. Code is made available to facilitate further research.1"
Regularized Fine-Grained Meta Face Anti-Spoofing,"Face presentation attacks have become an increasingly critical concern when face recognition is widely applied. Many face anti-spoofing methods have been proposed, but most of them ignore the generalization ability to unseen attacks. To overcome the limitation, this work casts face anti-spoofing as a domain generalization (DG) problem, and attempts to address this problem by developing a new meta-learning framework called Regularized Fine-grained Meta-learning. To let our face anti-spoofing model generalize well to unseen attacks, the proposed framework trains our model to perform well in the simulated domain shift scenarios, which is achieved by finding generalized learning directions in the meta-learning process. Specifically, the proposed framework incorporates the domain knowledge of face anti-spoofing as the regularization so that meta-learning is conducted in the feature space regularized by the supervision of domain knowledge. This enables our model more likely to find generalized learning directions with the regularized meta-learning for face anti-spoofing task. Besides, to further enhance the generalization ability of our model, the proposed framework adopts a fine-grained learning strategy that simultaneously conducts meta-learning in a variety of domain shift scenarios in each iteration. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Multimodal Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction in Crowded Space,"Accurate human path forecasting in complex and crowded scenarios is critical for collision avoidance of autonomous driving and social robots navigation. It still remains as a challenging problem because of dynamic human interaction and intrinsic multimodality of human motion. Given the observation, there is a rich set of plausible ways for an agent to walk through the circumstance. To address those issues, we propose a spatio-temporal model that can aggregate the information from socially interacting agents and capture the multimodality of the motion patterns. We use mixture density functions to describe the human path and predict the distribution of future paths with explicit density. To integrate more factors to model interacting people, we further introduce a coordinate transformation to represent the relative motion between people. Extensive experiments over several trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate that our method is able to forecast various plausible futures in complex scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Optimal Feature Transport for Cross-View Image Geo-Localization,"This paper addresses the problem of cross-view image geo-localization, where the geographic location of a ground-level street-view query image is estimated by matching it against a large scale aerial map (e.g., a high-resolution satellite image). State-of-the-art deep-learning based methods tackle this problem as deep metric learning which aims to learn global feature representations of the scene seen by the two different views. Despite promising results are obtained by such deep metric learning methods, they, however, fail to exploit a crucial cue relevant for localization, namely, the spatial layout of local features. Moreover, little attention is paid to the obvious domain gap (between aerial view and ground view) in the context of cross-view localization. This paper proposes a novel Cross-View Feature Transport (CVFT) technique to explicitly establish cross-view domain transfer that facilitates feature alignment between ground and aerial images. Specifically, we implement the CVFT as network layers, which transports features from one domain to the other, leading to more meaningful feature similarity comparison. Our model is differentiable and can be learned end-to-end. Experiments on large-scale datasets have demonstrated that our method has remarkably boosted the state-of-the-art cross-view localization performance, e.g., on the CVUSA dataset, with significant improvements for top-1 recall from 40.79% to 61.43%, and for top-10 from 76.36% to 90.49%. We expect the key insight of the paper (i.e., explicitly handling domain difference via domain transport) will prove to be useful for other similar problems in computer vision as well."
Identifying Model Weakness with Adversarial Examiner,"Machine learning models are usually evaluated according to the average case performance on the test set. However, this is not always ideal, because in some sensitive domains (e.g. autonomous driving), it is the worst case performance that matters more. In this paper, we are interested in systematic exploration of the input data space to identify the weakness of the model to be evaluated. We propose to use an adversarial examiner in the testing stage. Different from the existing strategy to always give the same (distribution of) test data, the adversarial examiner will dynamically select the next test data to hand out based on the testing history so far, with the goal being to undermine the model's performance. This sequence of test data not only helps us understand the current model, but also serves as constructive feedback to help improve the model in the next iteration. We conduct experiments on ShapeNet object classification. We show that our adversarial examiner can successfully put more emphasis on the weakness of the model, preventing performance estimates from being overly optimistic."
Efficient Residual Dense Block Search for Image Super-Resolution,"Although remarkable progress has been made on single image super-resolution due to the revival of deep convolutional neural networks, deep learning methods are confronted with the challenges of computation and memory consumption in practice, especially for mobile devices. Focusing on this issue, we propose an efficient residual dense block search algorithm with multiple objectives to hunt for fast, lightweight and accurate networks for image super-resolution. Firstly, to accelerate super-resolution network, we exploit the variation of feature scale adequately with the proposed efficient residual dense blocks. In the proposed evolutionary algorithm, the locations of pooling and upsampling operator are searched automatically. Secondly, network architecture is evolved with the guidance of block credits to acquire accurate super-resolution network. The block credit reflects the effect of current block and is earned during model evaluation process. It guides the evolution by weighing the sampling probability of mutation to favor admirable blocks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed searching method and the found efficient super-resolution models achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods with limited number of parameters and FLOPs."
KPNet: Towards Minimal Face Detector,"The small receptive field and capacity of minimal neural networks limit their performance when using them to be the backbone of detectors. In this work, we find that the appearance feature of a generic face is discriminative enough for a tiny and shallow neural network to verify from the background. And the essential barriers behind us are 1) the vague definition of the face bounding box and 2) tricky design of anchor-boxes or receptive field. Unlike most top-down methods for joint face detection and alignment, the proposed KPNet detects small facial keypoints instead of the whole face by in the bottom-up manner. It first predicts the facial landmarks from a low-resolution image via the well-designed fine-grained scale approximation and scale adaptive soft-argmax operator. Finally, the precise face bounding boxes, no matter how we define it, can be inferred from the keypoints. Without any complex head architecture or meticulous network designing, the KPNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on generic face detection and alignment benchmarks with only  ∼ 1M parameters, which runs at 1000fps on GPU and is easy to perform real-time on most modern front-end chips."
Multi-Spectral Salient Object Detection by Adversarial Domain Adaptation,"Although there are many existing research works about the salient object detection (SOD) in RGB images, there are still many complex situations that regular RGB images cannot provide enough cues for the accurate SOD, such as the shadow effect, similar appearance between background and foreground, strong or insufficient illumination, etc. Because of the success of near-infrared spectrum in many computer vision tasks, we explore the multi-spectral SOD in the synchronized RGB images and near-infrared (NIR) images for the both simple and complex situations. We assume that the RGB SOD in the existing RGB image datasets could provide references for the multi-spectral SOD problem. In this paper, we first collect and will publicize a large multi-spectral dataset including 780 synchronized RGB and NIR image pairs for the multi-spectral SOD problem in the simple and complex situations. We model this research problem as an adversarial domain adaptation from the existing RGB image dataset (source domain) to the collected multi-spectral dataset (target domain). Experimental results show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed adversarial domain adaptation for the multi-spectral SOD."
Stereoscopic Image Super-Resolution with Stereo Consistent Feature,"We present a first attempt for stereoscopic image super-resolution (SR) for recovering high-resolution details while preserving stereo-consistency between stereoscopic image pair. The most challenging issue in the stereoscopic SR is that the texture details should be consistent for corresponding pixels in stereoscopic SR image pair. However, existing stereo SR methods cannot maintain the stereo-consistency, thus causing 3D fatigue to the viewers. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a self and parallax attention mechanism (SPAM) to aggregate the information from its own image and the counterpart stereo image simultaneously, thus reconstructing high-quality stereoscopic SR image pairs. Moreover, we design an efficient network architecture and effective loss functions to enforce stereo-consistency constraint. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art SR methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual quality while maintaining stereo-consistency between stereoscopic image pair."
An Efficient Framework for Dense Video Captioning,"Dense video captioning is an extremely challenging task since an accurate and faithful description of events in a video requires a holistic knowledge of the video contents as well as contextual reasoning of individual events. Most existing approaches handle this problem by first proposing event boundaries from a video and then captioning on a subset of the proposals. Generation of dense temporal annotations and corresponding captions from long videos can be dramatically source consuming. In this paper, we focus on the task of generating a dense description of temporally untrimmed videos and aim to significantly reduce the computational cost by processing fewer frames while maintaining accuracy. Existing video captioning methods sample frames with a predefined frequency over the entire video or use all the frames. Instead, we propose a deep reinforcement-based approach which enables an agent to describe multiple events in a video by watching a portion of the frames. The agent needs to watch more frames when it is processing an informative part of the video, and skip frames when there is redundancy. The agent is trained using actor-critic algorithm, where the actor determines the frames to be watched from a video and the critic assesses the optimality of the decisions taken by the actor. Such an efficient frame selection simplifies the event proposal task considerably. This has the added effect of reducing the occurrence of unwanted proposals. The encoded state representation of the frame selection agent is further utilized for guiding event proposal and caption generation tasks. We also leverage the idea of knowledge distillation to improve the accuracy. We conduct extensive evaluations on ActivityNet captions dataset to validate our method."
Fine-Grained Recognition: Accounting for Subtle Differences between Similar Classes,"The main requisite for fine-grained recognition task is to focus on subtle discriminative details that make the subordinate classes different from each other. We note that existing methods implicitly address this requirement and leave it to a data-driven pipeline to figure out what makes a subordinate class different from the others. This results in two major limitations: First, the network focuses on the most obvious distinctions between classes and overlooks more subtle inter-class variations. Second, the chance of misclassifying a given sample in any of the negative classes is considered equal, while in fact, confusions generally occur among only the most similar classes. Here, we propose to explicitly force the network to find the subtle differences among closely related classes. In this pursuit, we introduce two key novelties that can be easily plugged into existing end-to-end deep learning pipelines. On one hand, we introduce “diversification block” which masks the most salient features for an input to force the network to use more subtle cues for its correct classification. Concurrently, we introduce a “gradient-boosting” loss function that focuses only on the confusing classes for each sample and therefore moves swiftly along the direction on the loss surface that seeks to resolve these ambiguities. The synergy between these two blocks helps the network to learn more effective feature representations. Comprehensive experiments are performed on five challenging datasets. Our approach outperforms existing methods using similar experimental setting on all five datasets."
Relation-Aware Pedestrian Attribute Recognition with Graph Convolutional Networks,"In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end network, named Joint Learning of Attribute and Contextual relations (JLAC), to solve the task of pedestrian attribute recognition. It includes two novel modules: Attribute Relation Module (ARM) and Contextual Relation Module (CRM). For ARM, we construct an attribute graph with attribute-specific features which are learned by the constrained losses, and further use Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to explore the correlations among multiple attributes. For CRM, we first propose a graph projection scheme to project the 2-D feature map into a set of nodes from different image regions, and then employ GCN to explore the contextual relations among those regions. Since the relation information in the above two modules is correlated and complementary, we incorporate them into a unified framework to learn both together. Experiments on three benchmarks, including PA-100K, RAP, PETA attribute datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed JLAC."
R²MRF: Defocus Blur Detection via Recurrently Refining Multi-Scale Residual Features,"Defocus blur detection aims to separate the in-focus and out-of-focus regions in an image. Although attracting more and more attention due to its remarkable potential applications, there are still several challenges for accurate defocus blur detection, such as the interference of background clutter, sensitivity to scales and missing boundary details of defocus blur regions. In order to address these issues, we propose a deep neural network which Recurrently Refines Multi-scale Residual Features (R2MRF) for defocus blur detection. We firstly extract multi-scale deep features by utilizing a fully convolutional network. For each layer, we design a novel recurrent residual refinement branch embedded with multiple residual refinement modules (RRMs) to more accurately detect blur regions from the input image. Considering that the features from bottom layers are able to capture rich low-level features for details preservation while the features from top layers are capable of characterizing the semantic information for locating blur regions, we aggregate the deep features from different layers to learn the residual between the intermediate prediction and the ground truth for each recurrent step in each residual refinement branch. Since the defocus degree is sensitive to image scales, we finally fuse the side output of each branch to obtain the final blur detection map. We evaluate the proposed network on two commonly used defocus blur detection benchmark datasets by comparing it with other 11 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experimental results with ablation studies demonstrate that R2MRF consistently and significantly outperforms the competitors in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."
V-PROM: A Benchmark for Visual Reasoning Using Visual Progressive Matrices,"Advances in machine learning have generated increasing enthusiasm for tasks that require high-level reasoning on top of perceptual capabilities, particularly over visual data. Such tasks include, for example, image captioning, visual question answering, and visual navigation. Their evaluation is however hindered by task-specific confounding factors and dataset biases. In parallel, the existing benchmarks for abstract reasoning are limited to synthetic stimuli (e.g. images of simple shapes) and do not capture the challenges of real-world data. We propose a new large-scale benchmark to evaluates abstract reasoning over real visual data. The test involves visual questions that require operations fundamental to many high-level vision tasks, such as comparisons of counts and logical operations on complex visual properties. The benchmark measures a method's ability to infer high-level relationships and to generalise them over image-based concepts. We provide multiple training/test splits that require controlled levels of generalization. We evaluate a range of deep learning architectures, and find that existing models, including those popular for vision-and-language tasks, are unable to solve seemingly-simple instances. Models using relational networks fare better but leave substantial room for improvement."
End-to-End Thorough Body Perception for Person Search,"In this paper, we propose an improved end-to-end multi-branch person search network to jointly optimize person detection, re-identification, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection. First, we build a better and faster base model to extract non-highly correlated feature expression; Second, a foreground feature enhance module is used to alleviate undesirable background noise in person feature maps; Third, we design an algorithm to learn the part-aligned representation for person search. Extensive experiments with ablation analysis show the effectiveness of our proposed end-to-end multi-task model, and we demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets including CUHK-SYSU and PRW."
Differentiable Meta-Learning Model for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"To address the annotation scarcity issue in some cases of semantic segmentation, there have been a few attempts to develop the segmentation model in the few-shot learning paradigm. However, most existing methods only focus on the traditional 1-way segmentation setting (i.e., one image only contains a single object). This is far away from practical semantic segmentation tasks where the K-way setting (K > 1) is usually required by performing the accurate multi-object segmentation. To deal with this issue, we formulate the few-shot semantic segmentation task as a learning-based pixel classification problem, and propose a novel framework called MetaSegNet based on meta-learning. In MetaSegNet, an architecture of embedding module consisting of the global and local feature branches is developed to extract the appropriate meta-knowledge for the few-shot segmentation. Moreover, we incorporate a linear model into MetaSegNet as a base learner to directly predict the label of each pixel for the multi-object segmentation. Furthermore, our MetaSegNet can be trained by the episodic training mechanism in an end-to-end manner from scratch. Experiments on two popular semantic segmentation datasets, i.e., PASCAL VOC and COCO, reveal the effectiveness of the proposed MetaSegNet in the K-way few-shot semantic segmentation task."
Attention-Based View Selection Networks for Light-Field Disparity Estimation,"This paper introduces a novel deep network for estimating depth maps from a light field image. For utilizing the views more effectively and reducing redundancy within views, we propose a view selection module that generates an attention map indicating the importance of each view and its potential for contributing to accurate depth estimation. By exploring the symmetric property of light field views, we enforce symmetry in the attention map and further improve accuracy. With the attention map, our architecture utilizes all views more effectively and efficiently. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and ranks the first on a popular benchmark for disparity estimation for light field images."
Image Cropping with Composition and Saliency Aware Aesthetic Score Map,"Aesthetic image cropping is a practical but challenging task which aims at finding the best crops with the highest aesthetic quality in an image. Recently, many deep learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, but they did not reveal the intrinsic mechanism of aesthetic evaluation. In this paper, we propose an interpretable image cropping model to unveil the mystery. For each image, we use a fully convolutional network to produce an aesthetic score map, which is shared among all candidate crops during crop-level aesthetic evaluation. Then, we require the aesthetic score map to be both composition-aware and saliency-aware. In particular, the same region is assigned with different aesthetic scores based on its relative positions in different crops. Moreover, a visually salient region is supposed to have more sensitive aesthetic scores so that our network can learn to place salient objects at more proper positions. Such an aesthetic score map can be used to localize aesthetically important regions in an image, which sheds light on the composition rules learned by our model. We show the competitive performance of our model in the image cropping task on several benchmark datasets, and also demonstrate its generality in real-world applications."
Optical Flow in Deep Visual Tracking,"Single-target tracking of generic objects is a difficult task since a trained tracker is given information present only in the first frame of a video. In recent years, increasingly many trackers have been based on deep neural networks that learn generic features relevant for tracking. This paper argues that deep architectures are often fit to learn implicit representations of optical flow. Optical flow is intuitively useful for tracking, but most deep trackers must learn it implicitly. This paper is among the first to study the role of optical flow in deep visual tracking. The architecture of a typical tracker is modified to reveal the presence of implicit representations of optical flow and to assess the effect of using the flow information more explicitly. The results show that the considered network learns implicitly an effective representation of optical flow. The implicit representation can be replaced by an explicit flow input without a notable effect on performance. Using the implicit and explicit representations at the same time does not improve tracking accuracy. The explicit flow input could allow constructing lighter networks for tracking."
TextScanner: Reading Characters in Order for Robust Scene Text Recognition,"Driven by deep learning and a large volume of data, scene text recognition has evolved rapidly in recent years. Formerly, RNN-attention-based methods have dominated this field, but suffer from the problem of attention drift in certain situations. Lately, semantic segmentation based algorithms have proven effective at recognizing text of different forms (horizontal, oriented and curved). However, these methods may produce spurious characters or miss genuine characters, as they rely heavily on a thresholding procedure operated on segmentation maps. To tackle these challenges, we propose in this paper an alternative approach, called TextScanner, for scene text recognition. TextScanner bears three characteristics: (1) Basically, it belongs to the semantic segmentation family, as it generates pixel-wise, multi-channel segmentation maps for character class, position and order; (2) Meanwhile, akin to RNN-attention-based methods, it also adopts RNN for context modeling; (3) Moreover, it performs paralleled prediction for character position and class, and ensures that characters are transcripted in the correct order. The experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that TextScanner outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TextScanner shows its superiority in recognizing more difficult text such as Chinese transcripts and aligning with target characters."
Progressive Feature Polishing Network for Salient Object Detection,"Feature matters for salient object detection. Existing methods mainly focus on designing a sophisticated structure to incorporate multi-level features and filter out cluttered features. We present Progressive Feature Polishing Network (PFPN), a simple yet effective framework to progressively polish the multi-level features to be more accurate and representative. By employing multiple Feature Polishing Modules (FPMs) in a recurrent manner, our approach is able to detect salient objects with fine details without any post-processing. A FPM parallelly updates the features of each level by directly incorporating all higher level context information. Moreover, it can keep the dimensions and hierarchical structures of the feature maps, which makes it flexible to be integrated with any CNN-based models. Empirical experiments show that our results are monotonically getting better with increasing number of FPMs. Without bells and whistles, PFPN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly on five benchmark datasets under various evaluation metrics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/chenquan-cq/PFPN."
Region-Based Global Reasoning Networks,"Global reasoning plays a significant role in many computer vision tasks which need to capture long-distance relationships. However, most current studies on global reasoning focus on exploring the relationship between pixels and ignore the critical role of the regions. In this paper, we propose an novel approach that explores the relationship between regions which have richer semantics than pixels. Specifically, we design a region aggregation method that can gather regional features automatically into a uniform shape, and adjust theirs positions adaptively for better alignment. To achieve the best performance of global reasoning, we propose various relationship exploration methods and apply them on the regional features. Our region-based global reasoning module, named ReGr, is end-to-end and can be inserted into existing visual understanding models without extra supervision. To evaluate our approach, we apply ReGr to fine-grained classification and action recognition benchmark tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Cross-Modality Paired-Images Generation for RGB-Infrared Person Re-Identification,"RGB-Infrared (IR) person re-identification is very challenging due to the large cross-modality variations between RGB and IR images. The key solution is to learn aligned features to the bridge RGB and IR modalities. However, due to the lack of correspondence labels between every pair of RGB and IR images, most methods try to alleviate the variations with set-level alignment by reducing the distance between the entire RGB and IR sets. However, this set-level alignment may lead to misalignment of some instances, which limits the performance for RGB-IR Re-ID. Different from existing methods, in this paper, we propose to generate cross-modality paired-images and perform both global set-level and fine-grained instance-level alignments. Our proposed method enjoys several merits. First, our method can perform set-level alignment by disentangling modality-specific and modality-invariant features. Compared with conventional methods, ours can explicitly remove the modality-specific features and the modality variation can be better reduced. Second, given cross-modality unpaired-images of a person, our method can generate cross-modality paired images from exchanged images. With them, we can directly perform instance-level alignment by minimizing distances of every pair of images. Extensive experimental results on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model favourably against state-of-the-art methods. Especially, on SYSU-MM01 dataset, our model can achieve a gain of 9.2% and 7.7% in terms of Rank-1 and mAP. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/JSIA-ReID."
Context Modulated Dynamic Networks for Actor and Action Video Segmentation with Language Queries,"Actor and action video segmentation with language queries aims to segment out the expression referred objects in the video. This process requires comprehensive language reasoning and fine-grained video understanding. Previous methods mainly leverage dynamic convolutional networks to match visual and semantic representations. However, the dynamic convolution neglects spatial context when processing each region in the frame and is thus challenging to segment similar objects in the complex scenarios. To address such limitation, we construct a context modulated dynamic convolutional network. Specifically, we propose a context modulated dynamic convolutional operation in the proposed framework. The kernels for the specific region are generated from both language sentences and surrounding context features. Moreover, we devise a temporal encoder to incorporate motions into the visual features to further match the query descriptions. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Actor-Action Dataset Sentences (A2D Sentences) and J-HMDB Sentences, demonstrate that our proposed approach notably outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
All You Need Is Boundary: Toward Arbitrary-Shaped Text Spotting,"Recently, end-to-end text spotting that aims to detect and recognize text from cluttered images simultaneously has received particularly growing interest in computer vision. Different from the existing approaches that formulate text detection as bounding box extraction or instance segmentation, we localize a set of points on the boundary of each text instance. With the representation of such boundary points, we establish a simple yet effective scheme for end-to-end text spotting, which can read the text of arbitrary shapes. Experiments on three challenging datasets, including ICDAR2015, TotalText and COCO-Text demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art in both scene text detection and end-to-end text recognition tasks."
Temporally Grounding Language Queries in Videos by Contextual Boundary-Aware Prediction,"The task of temporally grounding language queries in videos is to temporally localize the best matched video segment corresponding to a given language (sentence). It requires certain models to simultaneously perform visual and linguistic understandings. Previous work predominantly ignores the precision of segment localization. Sliding window based methods use predefined search window sizes, which suffer from redundant computation, while existing anchor-based approaches fail to yield precise localization. We address this issue by proposing an end-to-end boundary-aware model, which uses a lightweight branch to predict semantic boundaries corresponding to the given linguistic information. To better detect semantic boundaries, we propose to aggregate contextual information by explicitly modeling the relationship between the current element and its neighbors. The most confident segments are subsequently selected based on both anchor and boundary predictions at the testing stage. The proposed model, dubbed Contextual Boundary-aware Prediction (CBP), outperforms its competitors with a clear margin on three public datasets."
"Show, Recall, and Tell: Image Captioning with Recall Mechanism","Generating natural and accurate descriptions in image captioning has always been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel recall mechanism to imitate the way human conduct captioning. There are three parts in our recall mechanism : recall unit, semantic guide (SG) and recalled-word slot (RWS). Recall unit is a text-retrieval module designed to retrieve recalled words for images. SG and RWS are designed for the best use of recalled words. SG branch can generate a recalled context, which can guide the process of generating caption. RWS branch is responsible for copying recalled words to the caption. Inspired by pointing mechanism in text summarization, we adopt a soft switch to balance the generated-word probabilities between SG and RWS. In the CIDEr optimization step, we also introduce an individual recalled-word reward (WR) to boost training. Our proposed methods (SG+RWS+WR) achieve BLEU-4 / CIDEr / SPICE scores of 36.6 / 116.9 / 21.3 with cross-entropy loss and 38.7 / 129.1 / 22.4 with CIDEr optimization on MSCOCO Karpathy test split, which surpass the results of other state-of-the-art methods."
POST: POlicy-Based Switch Tracking,"In visual object tracking, by reasonably fusing multiple experts, ensemble framework typically achieves superior performance compared to the individual experts. However, the necessity of parallelly running all the experts in most existing ensemble frameworks heavily limits their efficiency. In this paper, we propose POST, a POlicy-based Switch Tracker for robust and efficient visual tracking. The proposed POST tracker consists of multiple weak but complementary experts (trackers) and adaptively assigns one suitable expert for tracking in each frame. By formulating this expert switch in consecutive frames as a decision-making problem, we learn an agent via reinforcement learning to directly decide which expert to handle the current frame without running others. In this way, the proposed POST tracker maintains the performance merit of multiple diverse models while favorably ensuring the tracking efficiency. Extensive ablation studies and experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art trackers on 5 prevalent benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Sparsity-Inducing Binarized Neural Networks,"Binarization of feature representation is critical for Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs). Currently, sign function is the commonly used method for feature binarization. Although it works well on small datasets, the performance on ImageNet remains unsatisfied. Previous methods mainly focus on minimizing quantization error, improving the training strategies and decomposing each convolution layer into several binary convolution modules. However, whether sign is the only option for binarization has been largely overlooked. In this work, we propose the Sparsity-inducing Binarized Neural Network (Si-BNN), to quantize the activations to be either 0 or +1, which introduces sparsity into binary representation. We further introduce trainable thresholds into the backward function of binarization to guide the gradient propagation. Our method dramatically outperforms current state-of-the-arts, lowering the performance gap between full-precision networks and BNNs on mainstream architectures, achieving the new state-of-the-art on binarized AlexNet (Top-1 50.5%), ResNet-18 (Top-1 59.7%), and VGG-Net (Top-1 63.2%). At inference time, Si-BNN still enjoys the high efficiency of exclusive-not-or (xnor) operations."
Multi-Speaker Video Dialog with Frame-Level Temporal Localization,"To simulate human interaction in real life, dialog systems are introduced to generate a response to previous chat utterances. There have been several studies for two-speaker video dialogs in the form of question answering. However, more informative semantic cues might be exploited via a multi-rounds chatting or discussing about the video among multiple speakers. So multi-speakers video dialogs are more applicable in real life. Besides, speakers always chat about a sub-segment of the long video fragment for a period of time. Current video dialog systems require to be directly given the relevant video sub-segment which speakers are chatting about. However, it is always hard to accurately spot the corresponding video sub-segment in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of Multi-Speaker Video Dialog with frame-level Temporal Localization (MSVD-TL) to make video dialog systems more applicable. Given a long video fragment and a set of chat history utterances, MSVD-TL targets to predict the following response and localize the relevant video sub-segment in frame level, simultaneously. We develop a new multi-task model with a response prediction module and a frame-level temporal localization module. Besides, we focus on the characteristic of the video dialog generation process and exploit the relation among the video fragment, the chat history, and the following response to refine their representations. We evaluate our approach for both the Multi-Speaker Video Dialog without frame-level temporal localization (MSVD w/o TL) task and the MSVD-TL task. The experimental results further demonstrate that MSVD-TL enhances the applicability of video dialog in real life."
RDSNet: A New Deep Architecture forReciprocal Object Detection and Instance Segmentation,"Object detection and instance segmentation are two fundamental computer vision tasks. They are closely correlated but their relations have not yet been fully explored in most previous work. This paper presents RDSNet, a novel deep architecture for reciprocal object detection and instance segmentation. To reciprocate these two tasks, we design a two-stream structure to learn features on both the object level (i.e., bounding boxes) and the pixel level (i.e., instance masks) jointly. Within this structure, information from the two streams is fused alternately, namely information on the object level introduces the awareness of instance and translation variance to the pixel level, and information on the pixel level refines the localization accuracy of objects on the object level in return. Specifically, a correlation module and a cropping module are proposed to yield instance masks, as well as a mask based boundary refinement module for more accurate bounding boxes. Extensive experimental analyses and comparisons on the COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RDSNet. The source code is available at https://github.com/wangsr126/RDSNet."
Decoupled Attention Network for Text Recognition,"Text recognition has attracted considerable research interests because of its various applications. The cutting-edge text recognition methods are based on attention mechanisms. However, most of attention methods usually suffer from serious alignment problem due to its recurrency alignment operation, where the alignment relies on historical decoding results. To remedy this issue, we propose a decoupled attention network (DAN), which decouples the alignment operation from using historical decoding results. DAN is an effective, flexible and robust end-to-end text recognizer, which consists of three components: 1) a feature encoder that extracts visual features from the input image; 2) a convolutional alignment module that performs the alignment operation based on visual features from the encoder; and 3) a decoupled text decoder that makes final prediction by jointly using the feature map and attention maps. Experimental results show that DAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text recognition tasks, including offline handwritten text recognition and regular/irregular scene text recognition. Codes will be released.1"
One-Shot Learning for Long-Tail Visual Relation Detection,"The aim of visual relation detection is to provide a comprehensive understanding of an image by describing all the objects within the scene, and how they relate to each other, in  < object-predicate-object >  form; for example,  < person-lean on-wall > . This ability is vital for image captioning, visual question answering, and many other applications. However, visual relationships have long-tailed distributions and, thus, the limited availability of training samples is hampering the practicability of conventional detection approaches. With this in mind, we designed a novel model for visual relation detection that works in one-shot settings. The embeddings of objects and predicates are extracted through a network that includes a feature-level attention mechanism. Attention alleviates some of the problems with feature sparsity, and the resulting representations capture more discriminative latent features. The core of our model is a dual graph neural network that passes and aggregates the context information of predicates and objects in an episodic training scheme to improve recognition of the one-shot predicates and then generate the triplets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to center on the viability of one-shot learning for visual relation detection. Extensive experiments on two newly-constructed datasets show that our model significantly improved the performance of two tasks PredCls and SGCls from 2.8% to 12.2% compared with state-of-the-art baselines."
Consistent Video Style Transfer via Compound Regularization,"Recently, neural style transfer has drawn many attentions and significant progresses have been made, especially for image style transfer. However, flexible and consistent style transfer for videos remains a challenging problem. Existing training strategies, either using a significant amount of video data with optical flows or introducing single-frame regularizers, have limited performance on real videos. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of temporal consistency, based on which we analyze the drawbacks of existing training strategies; and then derive a new compound regularization. Experimental results show that the proposed regularization can better balance the spatial and temporal performance, which supports our modeling. Combining with the new cost formula, we design a zero-shot video style transfer framework. Moreover, for better feature migration, we introduce a new module to dynamically adjust inter-channel distributions. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art style transfer methods. Our project is publicly available at: https://daooshee.github.io/CompoundVST/."
Mis-Classified Vector Guided Softmax Loss for Face Recognition,"Face recognition has witnessed significant progress due to the advances of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the central task of which is how to improve the feature discrimination. To this end, several margin-based (e.g., angular, additive and additive angular margins) softmax loss functions have been proposed to increase the feature margin between different classes. However, despite great achievements have been made, they mainly suffer from three issues: 1) Obviously, they ignore the importance of informative features mining for discriminative learning; 2) They encourage the feature margin only from the ground truth class, without realizing the discriminability from other non-ground truth classes; 3) The feature margin between different classes is set to be same and fixed, which may not adapt the situations very well. To cope with these issues, this paper develops a novel loss function, which adaptively emphasizes the mis-classified feature vectors to guide the discriminative feature learning. Thus we can address all the above issues and achieve more discriminative face features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to inherit the advantages of feature margin and feature mining into a unified loss function. Experimental results on several benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiaobowang/."
Symbiotic Attention with Privileged Information for Egocentric Action Recognition,"Egocentric video recognition is a natural testbed for diverse interaction reasoning. Due to the large action vocabulary in egocentric video datasets, recent studies usually utilize a two-branch structure for action recognition, i.e., one branch for verb classification and the other branch for noun classification. However, correlation study between the verb and the noun branches have been largely ignored. Besides, the two branches fail to exploit local features due to the absence of position-aware attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel Symbiotic Attention framework leveraging Privileged information (SAP) for egocentric video recognition. Finer position-aware object detection features can facilitate the understanding of actor's interaction with the object. We introduce these features in action recognition and regard them as privileged information. Our framework enables mutual communication among the verb branch, the noun branch, and the privileged information. This communication process not only injects local details into global features, but also exploits implicit guidance about the spatio-temporal position of an on-going action. We introduce a novel symbiotic attention (SA) to enable effective communication. It first normalizes the detection guided features on one branch to underline the action-relevant information from the other branch. SA adaptively enhances the interactions among the three sources. To further catalyze this communication, spatial relations are uncovered for the selection of most action-relevant information. It identifies the most valuable and discriminative feature for classification. We validate the effectiveness of our SAP quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, it achieves the state-of-the-art on two large-scale egocentric video datasets."
Task-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation for 3D Object Detection,"Monocular depth estimation enables 3D perception from a single 2D image, thus attracting much research attention for years. Almost all methods treat foreground and background regions (“things and stuff”) in an image equally. However, not all pixels are equal. Depth of foreground objects plays a crucial role in 3D object recognition and localization. To date how to boost the depth prediction accuracy of foreground objects is rarely discussed. In this paper, we first analyze the data distributions and interaction of foreground and background, then propose the foreground-background separated monocular depth estimation (ForeSeE) method, to estimate the foreground and background depth using separate optimization objectives and decoders. Our method significantly improves the depth estimation performance on foreground objects. Applying ForeSeE to 3D object detection, we achieve 7.5 AP gains and set new state-of-the-art results among other monocular methods. Code will be available at: https://github.com/WXinlong/ForeSeE."
Multi-Label Classification with Label Graph Superimposing,"Images or videos always contain multiple objects or actions. Multi-label recognition has been witnessed to achieve pretty performance attribute to the rapid development of deep learning technologies. Recently, graph convolution network (GCN) is leveraged to boost the performance of multi-label recognition. However, what is the best way for label correlation modeling and how feature learning can be improved with label system awareness are still unclear. In this paper, we propose a label graph superimposing framework to improve the conventional GCN+CNN framework developed for multi-label recognition in the following two aspects. Firstly, we model the label correlations by superimposing label graph built from statistical co-occurrence information into the graph constructed from knowledge priors of labels, and then multi-layer graph convolutions are applied on the final superimposed graph for label embedding abstraction. Secondly, we propose to leverage embedding of the whole label system for better representation learning. In detail, lateral connections between GCN and CNN are added at shallow, middle and deep layers to inject information of label system into backbone CNN for label-awareness in the feature learning process. Extensive experiments are carried out on MS-COCO and Charades datasets, showing that our proposed solution can greatly improve the recognition performance and achieves new state-of-the-art recognition performance."
Pruning from Scratch,"Network pruning is an important research field aiming at reducing computational costs of neural networks. Conventional approaches follow a fixed paradigm which first trains a large and redundant network, and then determines which units (e.g., channels) are less important and thus can be removed. In this work, we find that pre-training an over-parameterized model is not necessary for obtaining the target pruned structure. In fact, a fully-trained over-parameterized model will reduce the search space for the pruned structure. We empirically show that more diverse pruned structures can be directly pruned from randomly initialized weights, including potential models with better performance. Therefore, we propose a novel network pruning pipeline which allows pruning from scratch with little training overhead. In the experiments for compressing classification models on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets, our approach not only greatly reduces the pre-training burden of traditional pruning methods, but also achieves similar or even higher accuracy under the same computation budgets. Our results facilitate the community to rethink the effectiveness of existing techniques used for network pruning."
Learning Diverse Stochastic Human-Action Generators by Learning Smooth Latent Transitions,"Human-motion generation is a long-standing challenging task due to the requirement of accurately modeling complex and diverse dynamic patterns. Most existing methods adopt sequence models such as RNN to directly model transitions in the original action space. Due to high dimensionality and potential noise, such modeling of action transitions is particularly challenging. In this paper, we focus on skeleton-based action generation and propose to model smooth and diverse transitions on a latent space of action sequences with much lower dimensionality. Conditioned on a latent sequence, actions are generated by a frame-wise decoder shared by all latent action-poses. Specifically, an implicit RNN is defined to model smooth latent sequences, whose randomness (diversity) is controlled by noise from the input. Different from standard action-prediction methods, our model can generate action sequences from pure noise without any conditional action poses. Remarkably, it can also generate unseen actions from mixed classes during training. Our model is learned with a bi-directional generative-adversarial-net framework, which can not only generate diverse action sequences of a particular class or mix classes, but also learns to classify action sequences within the same model. Experimental results show the superiority of our method in both diverse action-sequence generation and classification, relative to existing methods."
Graph-Propagation Based Correlation Learning for Weakly Supervised Fine-Grained Image Classification,"The key of Weakly Supervised Fine-grained Image Classification (WFGIC) is how to pick out the discriminative regions and learn the discriminative features from them. However, most recent WFGIC methods pick out the discriminative regions independently and utilize their features directly, while neglecting the facts that regions' features are mutually semantic correlated and region groups can be more discriminative. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Graph-propagation based Correlation Learning (GCL) model to fully mine and exploit the discriminative potentials of region correlations for WFGIC. Specifically, in discriminative region localization phase, a Criss-cross Graph Propagation (CGP) sub-network is proposed to learn region correlations, which establishes correlation between regions and then enhances each region by weighted aggregating other regions in a criss-cross way. By this means each region's representation encodes the global image-level context and local spatial context simultaneously, thus the network is guided to implicitly discover the more powerful discriminative region groups for WFGIC. In discriminative feature representation phase, the Correlation Feature Strengthening (CFS) sub-network is proposed to explore the internal semantic correlation among discriminative patches' feature vectors, to improve their discriminative power by iteratively enhancing informative elements while suppressing the useless ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed CGP and CFS sub-networks, and show that the GCL model achieves better performance both in accuracy and efficiency."
"Localize, Assemble, and Predicate: Contextual Object Proposal Embedding for Visual Relation Detection","Visual relation detection (VRD) aims to describe all interacting objects in an image using subject-predicate-object triplets. Critically, valid relations combinatorially grow in O(C2 R) for C object categories and R relationships. The frequencies of relation triplets exhibit a long-tailed distribution, which inevitably leads to bias towards popular visual relations in the learned VRD model. To address this problem, we propose localize-assemble-predicate network (LAP-Net), which decomposes VRD into three sub-tasks: localizing individual objects, assembling and predicting the subject-object pairs. In the first stage of LAP-Net, Region Proposal Network (RPN) is used to generate a few class-agnostic object proposals. Next, these proposals are assembled to form subject-object pairs via a second Pair Proposal Network (PPN), in which we propose a novel contextual embedding scheme. The inner product between embedded representations faithfully reflects the compatibility between a pair of proposals, without estimating object and subject class. Top-ranked pairs from stage two are fed into a third sub-network, which precisely estimates the relationship. The whole pipeline except for the last stage is object-category-agnostic in localizing relationships in an image, alleviating the bias in popular relations induced by training data. Our LAP-Net can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate that LAP-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VRD benchmark while maintaining high speed in inference."
EFANet: Exchangeable Feature Alignment Network for Arbitrary Style Transfer,"Style transfer has been an important topic both in computer vision and graphics. Since the seminal work of Gatys et al. first demonstrates the power of stylization through optimization in the deep feature space, quite a few approaches have achieved real-time arbitrary style transfer with straightforward statistic matching techniques. In this work, our key observation is that only considering features in the input style image for the global deep feature statistic matching or local patch swap may not always ensure a satisfactory style transfer; see e.g., Figure 1. Instead, we propose a novel transfer framework, EFANet, that aims to jointly analyze and better align exchangeable features extracted from the content and style image pair. In this way, the style feature from the style image seeks for the best compatibility with the content information in the content image, leading to more structured stylization results. In addition, a new whitening loss is developed for purifying the computed content features and better fusion with styles in feature space. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach."
Adaptive Cross-Modal Embeddings for Image-Text Alignment,
"F³Net: Fusion, Feedback and Focus for Salient Object Detection","Most of existing salient object detection models have achieved great progress by aggregating multi-level features extracted from convolutional neural networks. However, because of the different receptive fields of different convolutional layers, there exists big differences between features generated by these layers. Common feature fusion strategies (addition or concatenation) ignore these differences and may cause suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose the F3Net to solve above problem, which mainly consists of cross feature module (CFM) and cascaded feedback decoder (CFD) trained by minimizing a new pixel position aware loss (PPA). Specifically, CFM aims to selectively aggregate multi-level features. Different from addition and concatenation, CFM adaptively selects complementary components from input features before fusion, which can effectively avoid introducing too much redundant information that may destroy the original features. Besides, CFD adopts a multi-stage feedback mechanism, where features closed to supervision will be introduced to the output of previous layers to supplement them and eliminate the differences between features. These refined features will go through multiple similar iterations before generating the final saliency maps. Furthermore, different from binary cross entropy, the proposed PPA loss doesn't treat pixels equally, which can synthesize the local structure information of a pixel to guide the network to focus more on local details. Hard pixels from boundaries or error-prone parts will be given more attention to emphasize their importance. F3Net is able to segment salient object regions accurately and provide clear local details. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that F3Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on six evaluation metrics. Code will be released at https://github.com/weijun88/F3Net."
3D Single-Person Concurrent Activity Detection Using Stacked Relation Network,"We aim to detect real-world concurrent activities performed by a single person from a streaming 3D skeleton sequence. Different from most existing works that deal with concurrent activities performed by multiple persons that are seldom correlated, we focus on concurrent activities that are spatio-temporally or causally correlated and performed by a single person. For the sake of generalization, we propose an approach based on a decompositional design to learn a dedicated feature representation for each activity class. To address the scalability issue, we further extend the class-level decompositional design to the postural-primitive level, such that each class-wise representation does not need to be extracted by independent backbones, but through a dedicated weighted aggregation of a shared pool of postural primitives. There are multiple interdependent instances deriving from each decomposition. Thus, we propose Stacked Relation Networks (SRN), with a specialized relation network for each decomposition, so as to enhance the expressiveness of instance-wise representations via the inter-instance relationship modeling. SRN achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset and a newly collected dataset. The relation weights within SRN are interpretable among the activity contexts. The new dataset and code are available at https://github.com/weiyi1991/UA_Concurrent/"
Heuristic Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Video Recognition Models,"We study the problem of attacking video recognition models in the black-box setting, where the model information is unknown and the adversary can only make queries to detect the predicted top-1 class and its probability. Compared with the black-box attack on images, attacking videos is more challenging as the computation cost for searching the adversarial perturbations on a video is much higher due to its high dimensionality. To overcome this challenge, we propose a heuristic black-box attack model that generates adversarial perturbations only on the selected frames and regions. More specifically, a heuristic-based algorithm is proposed to measure the importance of each frame in the video towards generating the adversarial examples. Based on the frames' importance, the proposed algorithm heuristically searches a subset of frames where the generated adversarial example has strong adversarial attack ability while keeps the perturbations lower than the given bound. Besides, to further boost the attack efficiency, we propose to generate the perturbations only on the salient regions of the selected frames. In this way, the generated perturbations are sparse in both temporal and spatial domains. Experimental results of attacking two mainstream video recognition methods on the UCF-101 dataset and the HMDB-51 dataset demonstrate that the proposed heuristic black-box adversarial attack method can significantly reduce the computation cost and lead to more than 28% reduction in query numbers for the untargeted attack on both datasets."
Efficient Querying from Weighted Binary Codes,"Binary codes are widely used to represent the data due to their small storage and efficient computation. However, there exists an ambiguity problem that lots of binary codes share the same Hamming distance to a query. To alleviate the ambiguity problem, weighted binary codes assign different weights to each bit of binary codes and compare the binary codes by the weighted Hamming distance. Till now, performing the querying from the weighted binary codes efficiently is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a new method to rank the weighted binary codes and return the nearest weighted binary codes of the query efficiently. In our method, based on the multi-index hash tables, two algorithms, the table bucket finding algorithm and the table merging algorithm, are proposed to select the nearest weighted binary codes of the query in a non-exhaustive and accurate way. The proposed algorithms are justified by proving their theoretic properties. The experiments on three large-scale datasets validate both the search efficiency and the search accuracy of our method. Especially for the number of weighted binary codes up to one billion, our method shows a great improvement of more than 1000 times faster than the linear scan."
Online Hashing with Efficient Updating of Binary Codes,"Online hashing methods are efficient in learning the hash functions from the streaming data. However, when the hash functions change, the binary codes for the database have to be recomputed to guarantee the retrieval accuracy. Recomputing the binary codes by accumulating the whole database brings a timeliness challenge to the online retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a novel online hashing framework to update the binary codes efficiently without accumulating the whole database. In our framework, the hash functions are fixed and the projection functions are introduced to learn online from the streaming data. Therefore, inefficient updating of the binary codes by accumulating the whole database can be transformed to efficient updating of the binary codes by projecting the binary codes into another binary space. The queries and the binary code database are projected asymmetrically to further improve the retrieval accuracy. The experiments on two multi-label image databases demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our method for multi-label image retrieval."
Tracklet Self-Supervised Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification,"Existing unsupervised person re-identification (re-id) methods mainly focus on cross-domain adaptation or one-shot learning. Although they are more scalable than the supervised learning counterparts, relying on a relevant labelled source domain or one labelled tracklet per person initialisation still restricts their scalability in real-world deployments. To alleviate these problems, some recent studies develop unsupervised tracklet association and bottom-up image clustering methods, but they still rely on explicit camera annotation or merely utilise suboptimal global clustering. In this work, we formulate a novel tracklet self-supervised learning (TSSL) method, which is capable of capitalising directly from abundant unlabelled tracklet data, to optimise a feature embedding space for both video and image unsupervised re-id. This is achieved by designing a comprehensive unsupervised learning objective that accounts for tracklet frame coherence, tracklet neighbourhood compactness, and tracklet cluster structure in a unified formulation. As a pure unsupervised learning re-id model, TSSL is end-to-end trainable at the absence of source data annotation, person identity labels, and camera prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TSSL over a wide variety of the state-of-the-art alternative methods on four large-scale person re-id benchmarks, including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID."
CircleNet for Hip Landmark Detection,"Landmark detection plays a critical role in diagnosis of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH). Heatmap and anchor-based object detection techniques could obtain reasonable results. However, they have limitations in both robustness and precision given the complexities and inhomogeneity of hip X-ray images. In this paper, we propose a much simpler and more efficient framework called CircleNet to improve the accuracy of landmark detection by predicting landmark and corresponding radius. Using the CircleNet, we not only constrain the relationship between landmarks but also integrate landmark detection and object detection into an end-to-end framework. In order to capture the effective information of the long-range dependency of landmarks in the DDH image, here we propose a new context modeling framework, named the Local Non-Local (LNL) block. The LNL block has the benefits of both non-local block and lightweight computation. We construct a professional DDH dataset for the first time and evaluate our CircleNet on it. The dataset has the largest number of DDH X-ray images in the world to our knowledge. Our results show that the CircleNet can achieve the state-of-the-art results for landmark detection on the dataset with a large margin of 1.8 average pixels compared to current methods. The dataset and source code will be publicly available."
3D Human Pose Estimation via Explicit Compositional Depth Maps,"In this work, we tackle the problem of estimating 3D human pose in camera space from a monocular image. First, we propose to use densely-generated limb depth maps to ease the learning of body joints depth, which are well aligned with image cues. Then, we design a lifting module from 2D pixel coordinates to 3D camera coordinates which explicitly takes the depth values as inputs, and is aligned with camera perspective projection model. We show our method achieves superior performance on large-scale 3D pose datasets Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and sets the new state-of-the-art."
Tree-Structured Policy Based Progressive Reinforcement Learning for Temporally Language Grounding in Video,"Temporally language grounding in untrimmed videos is a newly-raised task in video understanding. Most of the existing methods suffer from inferior efficiency, lacking interpretability, and deviating from the human perception mechanism. Inspired by human's coarse-to-fine decision-making paradigm, we formulate a novel Tree-Structured Policy based Progressive Reinforcement Learning (TSP-PRL) framework to sequentially regulate the temporal boundary by an iterative refinement process. The semantic concepts are explicitly represented as the branches in the policy, which contributes to efficiently decomposing complex policies into an interpretable primitive action. Progressive reinforcement learning provides correct credit assignment via two task-oriented rewards that encourage mutual promotion within the tree-structured policy. We extensively evaluate TSP-PRL on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet datasets, and experimental results show that TSP-PRL achieves competitive performance over existing state-of-the-art methods."
Distraction-Aware Feature Learning for Human Attribute Recognition via Coarse-to-Fine Attention Mechanism,"Recently, Human Attribute Recognition (HAR) has become a hot topic due to its scientific challenges and application potentials, where localizing attributes is a crucial stage but not well handled. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach to HAR, namely Distraction-aware HAR (Da-HAR). It enhances deep CNN feature learning by improving attribute localization through a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism. At the coarse step, a self-mask block is built to roughly discriminate and reduce distractions, while at the fine step, a masked attention branch is applied to further eliminate irrelevant regions. Thanks to this mechanism, feature learning is more accurate, especially when heavy occlusions and complex backgrounds exist. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WIDER-Attribute and RAP databases, and state-of-the-art results are achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
Patch Proposal Network for Fast Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution Images,"Despite recent progress on the segmentation of high-resolution images, there exist an unsolved problem, i.e., the trade-off among the segmentation accuracy, memory resources and inference speed. So far, GLNet is introduced for high or ultra-resolution image segmentation, which has reduced the computational memory of the segmentation network. However, it ignores the importances of different cropped patches, and treats tiled patches equally for fusion with the whole image, resulting in high computational cost. To solve this problem, we introduce a patch proposal network (PPN) in this paper, which adaptively distinguishes the critical patches from the trivial ones to fuse with the whole image for refining segmentation. PPN is a classification network which alleviates network training burden and improves segmentation accuracy. We further embed PPN in a global-local segmentation network, instructing global branch and refinement branch to work collaboratively. We implement our method on four image datasets:DeepGlobe, ISIC, CRAG and Cityscapes, the first two are ultra-resolution image datasets and the last two are high-resolution image datasets. The experimental results show that our method achieves almost the best segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods and the inference speed is 12.9 fps on DeepGlobe and 10 fps on ISIC. Moreover, we embed PPN with the general semantic segmentation network and the experimental results on Cityscapes which contains more object classes demonstrate the generalization ability on general semantic segmentation."
SalSAC: A Video Saliency Prediction Model with Shuffled Attentions and Correlation-Based ConvLSTM,"The performance of predicting human fixations in videos has been much enhanced with the help of development of the convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network “SalSAC” for video saliency prediction, which uses the CNN-LSTM-Attention as the basic architecture and utilizes the information from both static and dynamic aspects. To better represent the static information of each frame, we first extract multi-level features of same size from different layers of the encoder CNN and calculate the corresponding multi-level attentions, then we randomly shuffle these attention maps among levels and multiply them to the extracted multi-level features respectively. Through this way, we leverage the attention consistency across different layers to improve the robustness of the network. On the dynamic aspect, we propose a correlation-based ConvLSTM to appropriately balance the influence of the current and preceding frames to the prediction. Experimental results on the DHF1K, Hollywood2 and UCF-sports datasets show that SalSAC outperforms many existing state-of-the-art methods."
Recognizing Instagram Filtered Images with Feature De-Stylization,"Deep neural networks have been shown to suffer from poor generalization when small perturbations are added (like Gaussian noise), yet little work has been done to evaluate their robustness to more natural image transformations like photo filters. This paper presents a study on how popular pretrained models are affected by commonly used Instagram filters. To this end, we introduce ImageNet-Instagram, a filtered version of ImageNet, where 20 popular Instagram filters are applied to each image in ImageNet. Our analysis suggests that simple structure preserving filters which only alter the global appearance of an image can lead to large differences in the convolutional feature space. To improve generalization, we introduce a lightweight de-stylization module that predicts parameters used for scaling and shifting feature maps to “undo” the changes incurred by filters, inverting the process of style transfer tasks. We further demonstrate the module can be readily plugged into modern CNN architectures together with skip connections. We conduct extensive studies on ImageNet-Instagram, and show quantitatively and qualitatively, that the proposed module, among other things, can effectively improve generalization by simply learning normalization parameters without retraining the entire network, thus recovering the alterations in the feature space caused by the filters."
Convolutional Hierarchical Attention Network for Query-Focused Video Summarization,"Previous approaches for video summarization mainly concentrate on finding the most diverse and representative visual contents as video summary without considering the user's preference. This paper addresses the task of query-focused video summarization, which takes user's query and a long video as inputs and aims to generate a query-focused video summary. In this paper, we consider the task as a problem of computing similarity between video shots and query. To this end, we propose a method, named Convolutional Hierarchical Attention Network (CHAN), which consists of two parts: feature encoding network and query-relevance computing module. In the encoding network, we employ a convolutional network with local self-attention mechanism and query-aware global attention mechanism to learns visual information of each shot. The encoded features will be sent to query-relevance computing module to generate query-focused video summary. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the competitive performance and show the effectiveness of our approach."
Adversarial Learning of Privacy-Preserving and Task-Oriented Representations,"Data privacy has emerged as an important issue as data-driven deep learning has been an essential component of modern machine learning systems. For instance, there could be a potential privacy risk of machine learning systems via the model inversion attack, whose goal is to reconstruct the input data from the latent representation of deep networks. Our work aims at learning a privacy-preserving and task-oriented representation to defend against such model inversion attacks. Specifically, we propose an adversarial reconstruction learning framework that prevents the latent representations decoded into original input data. By simulating the expected behavior of adversary, our framework is realized by minimizing the negative pixel reconstruction loss or the negative feature reconstruction (i.e., perceptual distance) loss. We validate the proposed method on face attribute prediction, showing that our method allows protecting visual privacy with a small decrease in utility performance. In addition, we show the utility-privacy trade-off with different choices of hyperparameter for negative perceptual distance loss at training, allowing service providers to determine the right level of privacy-protection with a certain utility performance. Moreover, we provide an extensive study with different selections of features, tasks, and the data to further analyze their influence on privacy protection."
"Motion-Based Generator Model: Unsupervised Disentanglement of Appearance, Trackable and Intrackable Motions in Dynamic Patterns","Dynamic patterns are characterized by complex spatial and motion patterns. Understanding dynamic patterns requires a disentangled representational model that separates the factorial components. A commonly used model for dynamic patterns is the state space model, where the state evolves over time according to a transition model and the state generates the observed image frames according to an emission model. To model the motions explicitly, it is natural for the model to be based on the motions or the displacement fields of the pixels. Thus in the emission model, we let the hidden state generate the displacement field, which warps the trackable component in the previous image frame to generate the next frame while adding a simultaneously emitted residual image to account for the change that cannot be explained by the deformation. The warping of the previous image is about the trackable part of the change of image frame, while the residual image is about the intrackable part of the image. We use a maximum likelihood algorithm to learn the model parameters that iterates between inferring latent noise vectors that drive the transition model and updating the parameters given the inferred latent vectors. Meanwhile we adopt a regularization term to penalize the norms of the residual images to encourage the model to explain the change of image frames by trackable motion. Unlike existing methods on dynamic patterns, we learn our model in unsupervised setting without ground truth displacement fields or optical flows. In addition, our model defines a notion of intrackability by the separation of warped component and residual component in each image frame. We show that our method can synthesize realistic dynamic pattern, and disentangling appearance, trackable and intrackable motions. The learned models can be useful for motion transfer, and it is natural to adopt it to define and measure intrackability of a dynamic pattern."
Segmenting Medical MRI via Recurrent Decoding Cell,"The encoder-decoder networks are commonly used in medical image segmentation due to their remarkable performance in hierarchical feature fusion. However, the expanding path for feature decoding and spatial recovery does not consider the long-term dependency when fusing feature maps from different layers, and the universal encoder-decoder network does not make full use of the multi-modality information to improve the network robustness especially for segmenting medical MRI. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion unit called Recurrent Decoding Cell (RDC) which leverages convolutional RNNs to memorize the long-term context information from the previous layers in the decoding phase. An encoder-decoder network, named Convolutional Recurrent Decoding Network (CRDN), is also proposed based on RDC for segmenting multi-modality medical MRI. CRDN adopts CNN backbone to encode image features and decode them hierarchically through a chain of RDCs to obtain the final high-resolution score map. The evaluation experiments on BrainWeb, MRBrainS and HVSMR datasets demonstrate that the introduction of RDC effectively improves the segmentation accuracy as well as reduces the model size, and the proposed CRDN owns its robustness to image noise and intensity non-uniformity in medical MRI."
PI-RCNN: An Efficient Multi-Sensor 3D Object Detector with Point-Based Attentive Cont-Conv Fusion Module,"LIDAR point clouds and RGB-images are both extremely essential for 3D object detection. So many state-of-the-art 3D detection algorithms dedicate in fusing these two types of data effectively. However, their fusion methods based on Bird's Eye View (BEV) or voxel format are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion approach named Point-based Attentive Cont-conv Fusion(PACF) module, which fuses multi-sensor features directly on 3D points. Except for continuous convolution, we additionally add a Point-Pooling and an Attentive Aggregation to make the fused features more expressive. Moreover, based on the PACF module, we propose a 3D multi-sensor multi-task network called Pointcloud-Image RCNN(PI-RCNN as brief), which handles the image segmentation and 3D object detection tasks. PI-RCNN employs a segmentation sub-network to extract full-resolution semantic feature maps from images and then fuses the multi-sensor features via powerful PACF module. Beneficial from the effectiveness of the PACF module and the expressive semantic features from the segmentation module, PI-RCNN can improve much in 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the PACF module and PI-RCNN on the KITTI 3D Detection benchmark, and our method can achieve state-of-the-art on the metric of 3D AP."
Video Face Super-Resolution with Motion-Adaptive Feedback Cell,"Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have recently achieved a remarkable success due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). Current state-of-the-art CNN methods usually treat the VSR problem as a large number of separate multi-frame super-resolution tasks, at which a batch of low resolution (LR) frames is utilized to generate a single high resolution (HR) frame, and running a slide window to select LR frames over the entire video would obtain a series of HR frames. However, duo to the complex temporal dependency between frames, with the number of LR input frames increase, the performance of the reconstructed HR frames become worse. The reason is in that these methods lack the ability to model complex temporal dependencies and hard to give an accurate motion estimation and compensation for VSR process. Which makes the performance degrade drastically when the motion in frames is complex. In this paper, we propose a Motion-Adaptive Feedback Cell (MAFC), a simple but effective block, which can efficiently capture the motion compensation and feed it back to the network in an adaptive way. Our approach efficiently utilizes the information of the inter-frame motion, the dependence of the network on motion estimation and compensation method can be avoid. In addition, benefiting from the excellent nature of MAFC, the network can achieve better performance in the case of extremely complex motion scenarios. Extensive evaluations and comparisons validate the strengths of our approach, and the experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework is outperform the state-of-the-art methods."
Facial Attribute Capsules for Noise Face Super Resolution,"Existing face super-resolution (SR) methods mainly assume the input image to be noise-free. Their performance degrades drastically when applied to real-world scenarios where the input image is always contaminated by noise. In this paper, we propose a Facial Attribute Capsules Network (FACN) to deal with the problem of high-scale super-resolution of noisy face image. Capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector models different properties of the same entity. Inspired by the concept of capsule, we propose an integrated representation model of facial information, which named Facial Attribute Capsule (FAC). In the SR processing, we first generated a group of FACs from the input LR face, and then reconstructed the HR face from this group of FACs. Aiming to effectively improve the robustness of FAC to noise, we generate FAC in semantic, probabilistic and facial attributes manners by means of integrated learning strategy. Each FAC can be divided into two sub-capsules: Semantic Capsule (SC) and Probabilistic Capsule (PC). Them describe an explicit facial attribute in detail from two aspects of semantic representation and probability distribution. The group of FACs model an image as a combination of facial attribute information in the semantic space and probabilistic space by an attribute-disentangling way. The diverse FACs could better combine the face prior information to generate the face images with fine-grained semantic attributes. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves superior hallucination results and outperforms state-of-the-art for very low resolution (LR) noise face image super resolution."
FusionDN: A Unified Densely Connected Network for Image Fusion,"In this paper, we present a new unsupervised and unified densely connected network for different types of image fusion tasks, termed as FusionDN. In our method, the densely connected network is trained to generate the fused image conditioned on source images. Meanwhile, a weight block is applied to obtain two data-driven weights as the retention degrees of features in different source images, which are the measurement of the quality and the amount of information in them. Losses of similarities based on these weights are applied for unsupervised learning. In addition, we obtain a single model applicable to multiple fusion tasks by applying elastic weight consolidation to avoid forgetting what has been learned from previous tasks when training multiple tasks sequentially, rather than train individual models for every fusion task or jointly train tasks roughly. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the advantages of FusionDN compared with state-of-the-art methods in different fusion tasks."
Universal-RCNN: Universal Object Detector via Transferable Graph R-CNN,"The dominant object detection approaches treat each dataset separately and fit towards a specific domain, which cannot adapt to other domains without extensive retraining. In this paper, we address the problem of designing a universal object detection model that exploits diverse category granularity from multiple domains and predict all kinds of categories in one system. Existing works treat this problem by integrating multiple detection branches upon one shared backbone network. However, this paradigm overlooks the crucial semantic correlations between multiple domains, such as categories hierarchy, visual similarity, and linguistic relationship. To address these drawbacks, we present a novel universal object detector called Universal-RCNN that incorporates graph transfer learning for propagating relevant semantic information across multiple datasets to reach semantic coherency. Specifically, we first generate a global semantic pool by integrating all high-level semantic representation of all the categories. Then an Intra-Domain Reasoning Module learns and propagates the sparse graph representation within one dataset guided by a spatial-aware GCN. Finally, an Inter-Domain Transfer Module is proposed to exploit diverse transfer dependencies across all domains and enhance the regional feature representation by attending and transferring semantic contexts globally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms multiple-branch models and achieves the state-of-the-art results on multiple object detection benchmarks (mAP: 49.1% on COCO)."
Geometry Sharing Network for 3D Point Cloud Classification and Segmentation,"In spite of the recent progresses on classifying 3D point cloud with deep CNNs, large geometric transformations like rotation and translation remain challenging problem and harm the final classification performance. To address this challenge, we propose Geometry Sharing Network (GS-Net) which effectively learns point descriptors with holistic context to enhance the robustness to geometric transformations. Compared with previous 3D point CNNs which perform convolution on nearby points, GS-Net can aggregate point features in a more global way. Specially, GS-Net consists of Geometry Similarity Connection (GSC) modules which exploit Eigen-Graph to group distant points with similar and relevant geometric information, and aggregate features from nearest neighbors in both Euclidean space and Eigenvalue space. This design allows GS-Net to efficiently capture both local and holistic geometric features such as symmetry, curvature, convexity and connectivity. Theoretically, we show the nearest neighbors of each point in Eigenvalue space are invariant to rotation and translation. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets, ModelNet40, ShapeNet Part. Experiments demonstrate that GS-Net achieves the state-of-the-art performances on major datasets, 93.3% on ModelNet40, and are more robust to geometric transformations."
Learning Inverse Depth Regression for Multi-View Stereo with Correlation Cost Volume,"Deep learning has shown to be effective for depth inference in multi-view stereo (MVS). However, the scalability and accuracy still remain an open problem in this domain. This can be attributed to the memory-consuming cost volume representation and inappropriate depth inference. Inspired by the group-wise correlation in stereo matching, we propose an average group-wise correlation similarity measure to construct a lightweight cost volume. This can not only reduce the memory consumption but also reduce the computational burden in the cost volume filtering. Based on our effective cost volume representation, we propose a cascade 3D U-Net module to regularize the cost volume to further boost the performance. Unlike the previous methods that treat multi-view depth inference as a depth regression problem or an inverse depth classification problem, we recast multi-view depth inference as an inverse depth regression task. This allows our network to achieve sub-pixel estimation and be applicable to large-scale scenes. Through extensive experiments on DTU dataset and Tanks and Temples dataset, we show that our proposed network with Correlation cost volume and Inverse DEpth Regression (CIDER1), achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its superior performance on scalability and accuracy."
Planar Prior Assisted PatchMatch Multi-View Stereo,"The completeness of 3D models is still a challenging problem in multi-view stereo (MVS) due to the unreliable photometric consistency in low-textured areas. Since low-textured areas usually exhibit strong planarity, planar models are advantageous to the depth estimation of low-textured areas. On the other hand, PatchMatch multi-view stereo is very efficient for its sampling and propagation scheme. By taking advantage of planar models and PatchMatch multi-view stereo, we propose a planar prior assisted PatchMatch multi-view stereo framework in this paper. In detail, we utilize a probabilistic graphical model to embed planar models into PatchMatch multi-view stereo and contribute a novel multi-view aggregated matching cost. This novel cost takes both photometric consistency and planar compatibility into consideration, making it suited for the depth estimation of both non-planar and planar regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can efficiently recover the depth information of extremely low-textured areas, thus obtaining high complete 3D models and achieving state-of-the-art performance."
A Proposal-Based Approach for Activity Image-to-Video Retrieval,"Activity image-to-video retrieval task aims to retrieve videos containing the similar activity as the query image, which is a challenging task because videos generally have many background segments irrelevant to the activity. In this paper, we utilize R-C3D model to represent a video by a bag of activity proposals, which can filter out background segments to some extent. However, there are still noisy proposals in each bag. Thus, we propose an Activity Proposal-based Image-to-Video Retrieval (APIVR) approach, which incorporates multi-instance learning into cross-modal retrieval framework to address the proposal noise issue. Specifically, we propose a Graph Multi-Instance Learning (GMIL) module with graph convolutional layer, and integrate this module with classification loss, adversarial loss, and triplet loss in our cross-modal retrieval framework. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware triplet loss based on point-to-subspace distance to preserve the structural information of activity proposals. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach."
GDFace: Gated Deformation for Multi-View Face Image Synthesis,"Photorealistic multi-view face synthesis from a single image is an important but challenging problem. Existing methods mainly learn a texture mapping model from the source face to the target face. However, they fail to consider the internal deformation caused by the change of poses, leading to the unsatisfactory synthesized results for large pose variations. In this paper, we propose a Gated Deformable Face Synthesis Network to model the deformation of faces that aids the synthesis of the target face image. Specifically, we propose a dual network that consists of two modules. The first module estimates the deformation of two views in the form of convolution offsets according to the input and target poses. The second one, on the other hand, leverages the predicted deformation offsets to create the target face image. In this way, pose changes are explicitly modeled in the face generator to cope with geometric transformation, by adaptively focusing on pertinent regions of the source image. To compensate offset estimation errors, we introduce a soft-gating mechanism that enables adaptive fusion between deformable features and primitive features. Extensive experimental results on five widely-used benchmarks show that our approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts on multi-view face synthesis, especially for large pose changes."
CF-LSTM: Cascaded Feature-Based Long Short-Term Networks for Predicting Pedestrian Trajectory,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an important but difficult task in self-driving or autonomous mobile robot field because there are complex unpredictable human-human interactions in crowded scenarios. There have been a large number of studies that attempt to understand humans' social behavior. However, most of these studies extract location features from previous one time step while neglecting the vital velocity features. In order to address this issue, we propose a novel feature-cascaded framework for long short-term network (CF-LSTM) without extra artificial settings or social rules. In this framework, feature information from previous two time steps are firstly extracted and then integrated as a cascaded feature to LSTM, which is able to capture the previous location information and dynamic velocity information, simultaneously. In addition, this scene-agnostic cascaded feature is the external manifestation of complex human-human interactions, which can also effectively capture dynamic interaction information in different scenes without any other pedestrians' information. Experiments on public benchmark datasets indicate that our model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods and this feature-cascaded framework has the ability to implicitly learn human-human interactions."
SiamFC++: Towards Robust and Accurate Visual Tracking with Target Estimation Guidelines,"Visual tracking problem demands to efficiently perform robust classification and accurate target state estimation over a given target at the same time. Former methods have proposed various ways of target state estimation, yet few of them took the particularity of the visual tracking problem itself into consideration. Based on a careful analysis, we propose a set of practical guidelines of target state estimation for high-performance generic object tracker design. Following these guidelines, we design our Fully Convolutional Siamese tracker++ (SiamFC++) by introducing both classification and target state estimation branch (G1), classification score without ambiguity (G2), tracking without prior knowledge (G3), and estimation quality score (G4). Extensive analysis and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles, our SiamFC++ tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks(OTB2015, VOT2018, LaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet), which proves both the tracking and generalization ability of the tracker. Particularly, on the large-scale TrackingNet dataset, SiamFC++ achieves a previously unseen AUC score of 75.4 while running at over 90 FPS, which is far above the real-time requirement."
ZoomNet: Part-Aware Adaptive Zooming Neural Network for 3D Object Detection,"3D object detection is an essential task in autonomous driving and robotics. Though great progress has been made, challenges remain in estimating 3D pose for distant and occluded objects. In this paper, we present a novel framework named ZoomNet for stereo imagery-based 3D detection. The pipeline of ZoomNet begins with an ordinary 2D object detection model which is used to obtain pairs of left-right bounding boxes. To further exploit the abundant texture cues in rgb images for more accurate disparity estimation, we introduce a conceptually straight-forward module – adaptive zooming, which simultaneously resizes 2D instance bounding boxes to a unified resolution and adjusts the camera intrinsic parameters accordingly. In this way, we are able to estimate higher-quality disparity maps from the resized box images then construct dense point clouds for both nearby and distant objects. Moreover, we introduce to learn part locations as complementary features to improve the resistance against occlusion and put forward the 3D fitting score to better estimate the 3D detection quality. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI 3D detection dataset indicate ZoomNet surpasses all previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins (improved by 9.4% on APbv (IoU=0.7) over pseudo-LiDAR). Ablation study also demonstrates that our adaptive zooming strategy brings an improvement of over 10% on AP3d (IoU=0.7). In addition, since the official KITTI benchmark lacks fine-grained annotations like pixel-wise part locations, we also present our KFG dataset by augmenting KITTI with detailed instance-wise annotations including pixel-wise part location, pixel-wise disparity, etc.. Both the KFG dataset and our codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/detectRecog/ZoomNet."
Shape-Aware Organ Segmentation by Predicting Signed Distance Maps,"In this work, we propose to resolve the issue existing in current deep learning based organ segmentation systems that they often produce results that do not capture the overall shape of the target organ and often lack smoothness. Since there is a rigorous mapping between the Signed Distance Map (SDM) calculated from object boundary contours and the binary segmentation map, we exploit the feasibility of learning the SDM directly from medical scans. By converting the segmentation task into predicting an SDM, we show that our proposed method retains superior segmentation performance and has better smoothness and continuity in shape. To leverage the complementary information in traditional segmentation training, we introduce an approximated Heaviside function to train the model by predicting SDMs and segmentation maps simultaneously. We validate our proposed models by conducting extensive experiments on a hippocampus segmentation dataset and the public MICCAI 2015 Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge dataset with multiple organs. While our carefully designed backbone 3D segmentation network improves the Dice coefficient by more than 5% compared to current state-of-the-arts, the proposed model with SDM learning produces smoother segmentation results with smaller Hausdorff distance and average surface distance, thus proving the effectiveness of our method."
FAS-Net: Construct Effective Features Adaptively for Multi-Scale Object Detection,"Feature pyramid is the mainstream method for multi-scale object detection. In most detectors with feature pyramid, each proposal is predicted based on feature grids pooled from only one feature level, which is assigned heuristically. Recent studies report that the feature representation extracted using this method is sub-optimal, since they ignore the valid information exists on other unselected layers of the feature pyramid. To address this issue, researchers present to fuse valid information across all feature levels. However, these methods can be further improved: the feature fusion strategies, which use common operation (element-wise max or sum) in most detectors, should be replaced by a more flexible way. In this work, a novel method called feature adaptive selection subnetwork (FAS-Net) is proposed to construct effective features for detecting objects of different scales. Particularly, its adaption consists of two level: global attention and local adaptive selection. First, we model the global context of each feature map with global attention based feature selection module (GAFSM), which can strengthen the effective features across each layer adaptively. Then we extract the features of each region of interest (RoI) on the entire feature pyramid to construct a RoI feature pyramid. Finally, the RoI feature pyramid is sent to the feature adaptive selection module (FASM) to integrate the strengthened features according to the input adaptively. Our FAS-Net can be easily extended to other two-stage object detectors with feature pyramid, and supports to analyze the importance of different feature levels for multi-scale objects quantitatively. Besides, FAS-Net can also be further applied to instance segmentation task and get consistent improvements. Experiments on PASCAL07/12 and MSCOCO17 demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method."
Gated Convolutional Networks with Hybrid Connectivity for Image Classification,"We propose a simple yet effective method to reduce the redundancy of DenseNet by substantially decreasing the number of stacked modules by replacing the original bottleneck by our SMG module, which is augmented by local residual. Furthermore, SMG module is equipped with an efficient two-stage pipeline, which aims to DenseNet-like architectures that need to integrate all previous outputs, i.e., squeezing the incoming informative but redundant features gradually by hierarchical convolutions as a hourglass shape and then exciting it by multi-kernel depthwise convolutions, the output of which would be compact and hold more informative multi-scale features. We further develop a forget and an update gate by introducing the popular attention modules to implement the effective fusion instead of a simple addition between reused and new features. Due to the Hybrid Connectivity (nested combination of global dense and local residual) and Gated mechanisms, we called our network as the HCGNet. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets show that HCGNet is more prominently efficient than DenseNet, and can also significantly outperform state-of-the-art networks with less complexity. Moreover, HCGNet also shows the remarkable interpretability and robustness by network dissection and adversarial defense, respectively. On MS-COCO, HCGNet can consistently learn better features than popular backbones."
Mining on Heterogeneous Manifolds for Zero-Shot Cross-Modal Image Retrieval,"Most recent approaches for the zero-shot cross-modal image retrieval map images from different modalities into a uniform feature space to exploit their relevance by using a pre-trained model. Based on the observation that manifolds of zero-shot images are usually deformed and incomplete, we argue that the manifolds of unseen classes are inevitably distorted during the training of a two-stream model that simply maps images from different modalities into a uniform space. This issue directly leads to poor cross-modal retrieval performance. We propose a bi-directional random walk scheme to mining more reliable relationships between images by traversing heterogeneous manifolds in the feature space of each modality. Our proposed method benefits from intra-modal distributions to alleviate the interference caused by noisy similarities in the cross-modal feature space. As a result, we achieved great improvement in the performance of the thermal v.s. visible image retrieval task. The code of this paper: https://github.com/fyang93/cross-modal-retrieval"
Asymmetric Co-Teaching for Unsupervised Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (re-ID), is a challenging task due to the high variance within identity samples and imaging conditions. Although recent advances in deep learning have achieved remarkable accuracy in settled scenes, i.e., source domain, few works can generalize well on the unseen target domain. One popular solution is assigning unlabeled target images with pseudo labels by clustering, and then retraining the model. However, clustering methods tend to introduce noisy labels and discard low confidence samples as outliers, which may hinder the retraining process and thus limit the generalization ability. In this study, we argue that by explicitly adding a sample filtering procedure after the clustering, the mined examples can be much more efficiently used. To this end, we design an asymmetric co-teaching framework, which resists noisy labels by cooperating two models to select data with possibly clean labels for each other. Meanwhile, one of the models receives samples as pure as possible, while the other takes in samples as diverse as possible. This procedure encourages that the selected training samples can be both clean and miscellaneous, and that the two models can promote each other iteratively. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework can consistently benefit most clustering based methods, and boost the state-of-the-art adaptation accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/FlyingRoastDuck/ACT_AAAI20."
Learning to Incorporate Structure Knowledge for Image Inpainting,"This paper develops a multi-task learning framework that attempts to incorporate the image structure knowledge to assist image inpainting, which is not well explored in previous works. The primary idea is to train a shared generator to simultaneously complete the corrupted image and corresponding structures — edge and gradient, thus implicitly encouraging the generator to exploit relevant structure knowledge while inpainting. In the meantime, we also introduce a structure embedding scheme to explicitly embed the learned structure features into the inpainting process, thus to provide possible preconditions for image completion. Specifically, a novel pyramid structure loss is proposed to supervise structure learning and embedding. Moreover, an attention mechanism is developed to further exploit the recurrent structures and patterns in the image to refine the generated structures and contents. Through multi-task learning, structure embedding besides with attention, our framework takes advantage of the structure knowledge and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets quantitatively and qualitatively."
An Adversarial Perturbation Oriented Domain Adaptation Approach for Semantic Segmentation,"We focus on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for the task of semantic segmentation. Recently, adversarial alignment has been widely adopted to match the marginal distribution of feature representations across two domains globally. However, this strategy fails in adapting the representations of the tail classes or small objects for semantic segmentation since the alignment objective is dominated by head categories or large objects. In contrast to adversarial alignment, we propose to explicitly train a domain-invariant classifier by generating and defensing against pointwise feature space adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we firstly perturb the intermediate feature maps with several attack objectives (i.e., discriminator and classifier) on each individual position for both domains, and then the classifier is trained to be invariant to the perturbations. By perturbing each position individually, our model treats each location evenly regardless of the category or object size and thus circumvents the aforementioned issue. Moreover, the domain gap in feature space is reduced by extrapolating source and target perturbed features towards each other with attack on the domain discriminator. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two challenging domain adaptation tasks for semantic segmentation: GTA5 → Cityscapes and SYNTHIA → Cityscapes."
FAN-Face: a Simple Orthogonal Improvement to Deep Face Recognition,"It is known that facial landmarks provide pose, expression and shape information. In addition, when matching, for example, a profile and/or expressive face to a frontal one, knowledge of these landmarks is useful for establishing correspondence which can help improve recognition. However, in prior work on face recognition, facial landmarks are only used for face cropping in order to remove scale, rotation and translation variations. This paper proposes a simple approach to face recognition which gradually integrates features from different layers of a facial landmark localization network into different layers of the recognition network. To this end, we propose an appropriate feature integration layer which makes the features compatible before integration. We show that such a simple approach systematically improves recognition on the most difficult face recognition datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art on IJB-B, IJB-C and MegaFace datasets."
Towards Scale-Free Rain Streak Removal via Self-Supervised Fractal Band Learning,"Data-driven rain streak removal methods, which most of rely on synthesized paired data, usually come across the generalization problem when being applied in real cases. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning based rain streak removal method injected with self-supervision to improve the ability to remove rain streaks in various scales. To realize this goal, we made efforts in two aspects. First, considering that rain streak removal is highly correlated with texture characteristics, we create a fractal band learning (FBL) network based on frequency band recovery. It integrates commonly seen band feature operations with neural modules and effectively improves the capacity to capture discriminative features for deraining. Second, to further improve the generalization ability of FBL for rain streaks in various scales, we add cross-scale self-supervision to regularize the network training. The constraint forces the extracted features of inputs in different scales to be equivalent after rescaling. Therefore, FBL can offer similar responses based on solely image content without the interleave of scale and is capable to remove rain streaks in various scales. Extensive experiments in quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our FBL for rain streak removal, especially for the real cases where very large rain streaks exist, and prove the effectiveness of its each component. Our code will be public available at: https://github.com/flyywh/AAAI-2020-FBL-SS."
SOGNet: Scene Overlap Graph Network for Panoptic Segmentation,"The panoptic segmentation task requires a unified result from semantic and instance segmentation outputs that may contain overlaps. However, current studies widely ignore modeling overlaps. In this study, we aim to model overlap relations among instances and resolve them for panoptic segmentation. Inspired by scene graph representation, we formulate the overlapping problem as a simplified case, named scene overlap graph. We leverage each object's category, geometry and appearance features to perform relational embedding, and output a relation matrix that encodes overlap relations. In order to overcome the lack of supervision, we introduce a differentiable module to resolve the overlap between any pair of instances. The mask logits after removing overlaps are fed into per-pixel instance id classification, which leverages the panoptic supervision to assist in the modeling of overlap relations. Besides, we generate an approximate ground truth of overlap relations as the weak supervision, to quantify the accuracy of overlap relations predicted by our method. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate that our method is able to accurately predict overlap relations, and outperform the state-of-the-art performance for panoptic segmentation. Our method also won the Innovation Award in COCO 2019 challenge."
Release the Power of Online-Training for Robust Visual Tracking,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted in the visual tracking community, significantly improving the state-of-the-art. However, most of them ignore the important cues lying in the distribution of training data and high-level features that are tightly coupled with the target/background classification. In this paper, we propose to improve the tracking accuracy via online training. On the one hand, we squeeze redundant training data by analyzing the dataset distribution in low-level feature space. On the other hand, we design statistic-based losses to increase the inter-class distance while decreasing the intra-class variance of high-level semantic features. We demonstrate the effectiveness on top of two high-performance tracking methods: MDNet and DAT. Experimental results on the challenging large-scale OTB2015 and UAVDT demonstrate the outstanding performance of our tracking method."
Context-Transformer: Tackling Object Confusion for Few-Shot Detection,"Few-shot object detection is a challenging but realistic scenario, where only a few annotated training images are available for training detectors. A popular approach to handle this problem is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a detector pretrained on a source-domain benchmark. However, such transferred detector often fails to recognize new objects in the target domain, due to low data diversity of training samples. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Context-Transformer within a concise deep transfer framework. Specifically, Context-Transformer can effectively leverage source-domain object knowledge as guidance, and automatically exploit contexts from only a few training images in the target domain. Subsequently, it can adaptively integrate these relational clues to enhance the discriminative power of detector, in order to reduce object confusion in few-shot scenarios. Moreover, Context-Transformer is flexibly embedded in the popular SSD-style detectors, which makes it a plug-and-play module for end-to-end few-shot learning. Finally, we evaluate Context-Transformer on the challenging settings of few-shot detection and incremental few-shot detection. The experimental results show that, our framework outperforms the recent state-of-the-art approaches."
SM-NAS: Structural-to-Modular Neural Architecture Search for Object Detection,"The state-of-the-art object detection method is complicated with various modules such as backbone, RPN, feature fusion neck and RCNN head, where each module may have different designs and structures. How to leverage the computational cost and accuracy trade-off for the structural combination as well as the modular selection of multiple modules? Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great potential in finding an optimal solution. Existing NAS works for object detection only focus on searching better design of a single module such as backbone or feature fusion neck, while neglecting the balance of the whole system. In this paper, we present a two-stage coarse-to-fine searching strategy named Structural-to-Modular NAS (SM-NAS) for searching a GPU-friendly design of both an efficient combination of modules and better modular-level architecture for object detection. Specifically, Structural-level searching stage first aims to find an efficient combination of different modules; Modular-level searching stage then evolves each specific module and pushes the Pareto front forward to a faster task-specific network. We consider a multi-objective search where the search space covers many popular designs of detection methods. We directly search a detection backbone without pre-trained models or any proxy task by exploring a fast training from scratch strategy. The resulting architectures dominate state-of-the-art object detection systems in both inference time and accuracy and demonstrate the effectiveness on multiple detection datasets, e.g. halving the inference time with additional 1% mAP improvement compared to FPN and reaching 46% mAP with the similar inference time of MaskRCNN."
Deep Discriminative CNN with Temporal Ensembling for Ambiguously-Labeled Image Classification,"In this paper, we study the problem of image classification where training images are ambiguously annotated with multiple candidate labels, among which only one is correct but is not accessible during the training phase. Due to the adopted non-deep framework and improper disambiguation strategies, traditional approaches are usually short of the representation ability and discrimination ability, so their performances are still to be improved. To remedy these two shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel approach termed “Deep Discriminative CNN” (D2CNN) with temporal ensembling. Specifically, to improve the representation ability, we innovatively employ the deep convolutional neural networks for ambiguously-labeled image classification, in which the well-known ResNet is adopted as our backbone. To enhance the discrimination ability, we design an entropy-based regularizer to maximize the margin between the potentially correct label and the unlikely ones of each image. In addition, we utilize the temporally assembled predictions of different epochs to guide the training process so that the latent groundtruth label can be confidently highlighted. This is much superior to the traditional disambiguation operations which treat all candidate labels equally and identify the hidden groundtruth label via some heuristic ways. Thorough experimental results on multiple datasets firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed D2CNN when compared with other existing state-of-the-art approaches."
Object-Guided Instance Segmentation for Biological Images,"Instance segmentation of biological images is essential for studying object behaviors and properties. The challenges, such as clustering, occlusion, and adhesion problems of the objects, make instance segmentation a non-trivial task. Current box-free instance segmentation methods typically rely on local pixel-level information. Due to a lack of global object view, these methods are prone to over- or under-segmentation. On the contrary, the box-based instance segmentation methods incorporate object detection into the segmentation, performing better in identifying the individual instances. In this paper, we propose a new box-based instance segmentation method. Mainly, we locate the object bounding boxes from their center points. The object features are subsequently reused in the segmentation branch as a guide to separate the clustered instances within an RoI patch. Along with the instance normalization, the model is able to recover the target object distribution and suppress the distribution of neighboring attached objects. Consequently, the proposed model performs excellently in segmenting the clustered objects while retaining the target object details. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on three biological datasets: cell nuclei, plant phenotyping dataset, and neural cells."
Leveraging Multi-View Image Sets for Unsupervised Intrinsic Image Decomposition and Highlight Separation,"We present an unsupervised approach for factorizing object appearance into highlight, shading, and albedo layers, trained by multi-view real images. To do so, we construct a multi-view dataset by collecting numerous customer product photos online, which exhibit large illumination variations that make them suitable for training of reflectance separation and can facilitate object-level decomposition. The main contribution of our approach is a proposed image representation based on local color distributions that allows training to be insensitive to the local misalignments of multi-view images. In addition, we present a new guidance cue for unsupervised training that exploits synergy between highlight separation and intrinsic image decomposition. Over a broad range of objects, our technique is shown to yield state-of-the-art results for both of these tasks."
Joint Super-Resolution and Alignment of Tiny Faces,"Super-resolution (SR) and landmark localization of tiny faces are highly correlated tasks. On the one hand, landmark localization could obtain higher accuracy with faces of high-resolution (HR). On the other hand, face SR would benefit from prior knowledge of facial attributes such as landmarks. Thus, we propose a joint alignment and SR network to simultaneously detect facial landmarks and super-resolve tiny faces. More specifically, a shared deep encoder is applied to extract features for both tasks by leveraging complementary information. To exploit representative power of the hierarchical encoder, intermediate layers of a shared feature extraction module are fused to form efficient feature representations. The fused features are then fed to task-specific modules to detect landmarks and super-resolve face images in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in both landmark localization and SR of faces. We show a large improvement for landmark localization of tiny faces (i.e., 16 × 16). Furthermore, the proposed framework yields comparable results for landmark localization on low-resolution (LR) faces (i.e., 64 × 64) to existing methods on HR (i.e., 256 × 256). As for SR, the proposed method recovers sharper edges and more details from LR face images than other state-of-the-art methods, which we demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively."
Facial Action Unit Intensity Estimation via Semantic Correspondence Learning with Dynamic Graph Convolution,"The intensity estimation of facial action units (AUs) is challenging due to subtle changes in the person's facial appearance. Previous approaches mainly rely on probabilistic models or predefined rules for modeling co-occurrence relationships among AUs, leading to limited generalization. In contrast, we present a new learning framework that automatically learns the latent relationships of AUs via establishing semantic correspondences between feature maps. In the heatmap regression-based network, feature maps preserve rich semantic information associated with AU intensities and locations. Moreover, the AU co-occurring pattern can be reflected by activating a set of feature channels, where each channel encodes a specific visual pattern of AU. This motivates us to model the correlation among feature channels, which implicitly represents the co-occurrence relationship of AU intensity levels. Specifically, we introduce a semantic correspondence convolution (SCC) module to dynamically compute the correspondences from deep and low resolution feature maps, and thus enhancing the discriminability of features. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the superior performance of our method on two benchmark datasets."
Cross-Modality Attention with Semantic Graph Embedding for Multi-Label Classification,"Multi-label image and video classification are fundamental yet challenging tasks in computer vision. The main challenges lie in capturing spatial or temporal dependencies between labels and discovering the locations of discriminative features for each class. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose to use cross-modality attention with semantic graph embedding for multi-label classification. Based on the constructed label graph, we propose an adjacency-based similarity graph embedding method to learn semantic label embeddings, which explicitly exploit label relationships. Then our novel cross-modality attention maps are generated with the guidance of learned label embeddings. Experiments on two multi-label image classification datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE) show our method outperforms other existing state-of-the-arts. In addition, we validate our method on a large multi-label video classification dataset (YouTube-8M Segments) and the evaluation results demonstrate the generalization capability of our method."
Pointwise Rotation-Invariant Network with Adaptive Sampling and 3D Spherical Voxel Convolution,"Point cloud analysis without pose priors is very challenging in real applications, as the orientations of point clouds are often unknown. In this paper, we propose a brand new point-set learning framework PRIN, namely, Pointwise Rotation-Invariant Network, focusing on rotation-invariant feature extraction in point clouds analysis. We construct spherical signals by Density Aware Adaptive Sampling to deal with distorted point distributions in spherical space. In addition, we propose Spherical Voxel Convolution and Point Re-sampling to extract rotation-invariant features for each point. Our network can be applied to tasks ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to 3D feature matching and label alignment. We show that, on the dataset with randomly rotated point clouds, PRIN demonstrates better performance than state-of-the-art methods without any data augmentation. We also provide theoretical analysis for the rotation-invariance achieved by our methods."
Cascading Convolutional Color Constancy,"Regressing the illumination of a scene from the representations of object appearances is popularly adopted in computational color constancy. However, it's still challenging due to intrinsic appearance and label ambiguities caused by unknown illuminants, diverse reflection properties of materials and extrinsic imaging factors (such as different camera sensors). In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm – Cascading Convolutional Color Constancy (in short, C4) to improve robustness of regression learning and achieve stable generalization capability across datasets (different cameras and scenes) in a unique framework. The proposed C4 method ensembles a series of dependent illumination hypotheses from each cascade stage via introducing a weighted multiply-accumulate loss function, which can inherently capture different modes of illuminations and explicitly enforce coarse-to-fine network optimization. Experimental results on the public Color Checker and NUS 8-Camera benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, especially for more difficult scenes."
Region Normalization for Image Inpainting,"Feature Normalization (FN) is an important technique to help neural network training, which typically normalizes features across spatial dimensions. Most previous image inpainting methods apply FN in their networks without considering the impact of the corrupted regions of the input image on normalization, e.g. mean and variance shifts. In this work, we show that the mean and variance shifts caused by full-spatial FN limit the image inpainting network training and we propose a spatial region-wise normalization named Region Normalization (RN) to overcome the limitation. RN divides spatial pixels into different regions according to the input mask, and computes the mean and variance in each region for normalization. We develop two kinds of RN for our image inpainting network: (1) Basic RN (RN-B), which normalizes pixels from the corrupted and uncorrupted regions separately based on the original inpainting mask to solve the mean and variance shift problem; (2) Learnable RN (RN-L), which automatically detects potentially corrupted and uncorrupted regions for separate normalization, and performs global affine transformation to enhance their fusion. We apply RN-B in the early layers and RN-L in the latter layers of the network respectively. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. We further generalize RN to other inpainting networks and achieve consistent performance improvements."
Patchy Image Structure Classification Using Multi-Orientation Region Transform,"Exterior contour and interior structure are both vital features for classifying objects. However, most of the existing methods consider exterior contour feature and internal structure feature separately, and thus fail to function when classifying patchy image structures that have similar contours and flexible structures. To address above limitations, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Orientation Region Transform (MORT), which can effectively characterize both contour and structure features simultaneously, for patchy image structure classification. MORT is performed over multiple orientation regions at multiple scales to effectively integrate patchy features, and thus enables a better description of the shape in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, the proposed MORT can be extended to combine with the deep convolutional neural network techniques, for further enhancement of classification accuracy. Very encouraging experimental results on the challenging ultra-fine-grained cultivar recognition task, insect wing recognition task, and large variation butterfly recognition task are obtained, which demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed MORT over the state-of-the-art methods in classifying patchy image structures. Our code and three patchy image structure datasets are available at: https://github.com/XiaohanYu-GU/MReT2019."
Human Synthesis and Scene Compositing,"Generating good quality and geometrically plausible synthetic images of humans with the ability to control appearance, pose and shape parameters, has become increasingly important for a variety of tasks ranging from photo editing, fashion virtual try-on, to special effects and image compression. In this paper, we propose a HUSC (HUman Synthesis and Scene Compositing) framework for the realistic synthesis of humans with different appearance, in novel poses and scenes. Central to our formulation is 3d reasoning for both people and scenes, in order to produce realistic collages, by correctly modeling perspective effects and occlusion, by taking into account scene semantics and by adequately handling relative scales. Conceptually our framework consists of three components: (1) a human image synthesis model with controllable pose and appearance, based on a parametric representation, (2) a person insertion procedure that leverages the geometry and semantics of the 3d scene, and (3) an appearance compositing process to create a seamless blending between the colors of the scene and the generated human image, and avoid visual artifacts. The performance of our framework is supported by both qualitative and quantitative results, in particular state-of-the art synthesis scores for the DeepFashion dataset."
Realistic Face Reenactment via Self-Supervised Disentangling of Identity and Pose,"Recent works have shown how realistic talking face images can be obtained under the supervision of geometry guidance, e.g., facial landmark or boundary. To alleviate the demand for manual annotations, in this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised hybrid model (DAE-GAN) that learns how to reenact face naturally given large amounts of unlabeled videos. Our approach combines two deforming autoencoders with the latest advances in the conditional generation. On the one hand, we adopt the deforming autoencoder to disentangle identity and pose representations. A strong prior in talking face videos is that each frame can be encoded as two parts: one for video-specific identity and the other for various poses. Inspired by that, we utilize a multi-frame deforming autoencoder to learn a pose-invariant embedded face for each video. Meanwhile, a multi-scale deforming autoencoder is proposed to extract pose-related information for each frame. On the other hand, the conditional generator allows for enhancing fine details and overall reality. It leverages the disentangled features to generate photo-realistic and pose-alike face images. We evaluate our model on VoxCeleb1 and RaFD dataset. Experiment results demonstrate the superior quality of reenacted images and the flexibility of transferring facial movements between identities."
Reliability Does Matter: An End-to-End Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Approach,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a challenging task as it only takes image-level information as supervision for training but produces pixel-level predictions for testing. To address such a challenging task, most recent state-of-the-art approaches propose to adopt two-step solutions, i.e.  1) learn to generate pseudo pixel-level masks, and 2) engage FCNs to train the semantic segmentation networks with the pseudo masks. However, the two-step solutions usually employ many bells and whistles in producing high-quality pseudo masks, making this kind of methods complicated and inelegant. In this work, we harness the image-level labels to produce reliable pixel-level annotations and design a fully end-to-end network to learn to predict segmentation maps. Concretely, we firstly leverage an image classification branch to generate class activation maps for the annotated categories, which are further pruned into confident yet tiny object/background regions. Such reliable regions are then directly served as ground-truth labels for the parallel segmentation branch, where a newly designed dense energy loss function is adopted for optimization. Despite its apparent simplicity, our one-step solution achieves competitive mIoU scores (val: 62.6, test: 62.9) on Pascal VOC compared with those two-step state-of-the-arts. By extending our one-step method to two-step, we get a new state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC (val: 66.3, test: 66.5)."
Shape-Oriented Convolution Neural Network for Point Cloud Analysis,"Point cloud is a principal data structure adopted for 3D geometric information encoding. Unlike other conventional visual data, such as images and videos, these irregular points describe the complex shape features of 3D objects, which makes shape feature learning an essential component of point cloud analysis. To this end, a shape-oriented message passing scheme dubbed ShapeConv is proposed to focus on the representation learning of the underlying shape formed by each local neighboring point. Despite this intra-shape relationship learning, ShapeConv is also designed to incorporate the contextual effects from the inter-shape relationship through capturing the long-ranged dependencies between local underlying shapes. This shape-oriented operator is stacked into our hierarchical learning architecture, namely Shape-Oriented Convolutional Neural Network (SOCNN), developed for point cloud analysis. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate its significance in the tasks of point cloud classification and part segmentation."
Web-Supervised Network with Softly Update-Drop Training for Fine-Grained Visual Classification,"Labeling objects at the subordinate level typically requires expert knowledge, which is not always available from a random annotator. Accordingly, learning directly from web images for fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) has attracted broad attention. However, the existence of noise in web images is a huge obstacle for training robust deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to remove irrelevant samples from the real-world web images during training, and only utilize useful images for updating the networks. Thus, our network can alleviate the harmful effects caused by irrelevant noisy web images to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments on three commonly used fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our approach is much superior to state-of-the-art webly supervised methods. The data and source code of this work have been made anonymously available at: https://github.com/z337-408/WSNFGVC."
FDN: Feature Decoupling Network for Head Pose Estimation,"Head pose estimation from RGB images without depth information is a challenging task due to the loss of spatial information as well as large head pose variations in the wild. The performance of existing landmark-free methods remains unsatisfactory as the quality of estimated pose is inferior. In this paper, we propose a novel three-branch network architecture, termed as Feature Decoupling Network (FDN), a more powerful architecture for landmark-free head pose estimation from a single RGB image. In FDN, we first propose a feature decoupling (FD) module to explicitly learn the discriminative features for each pose angle by adaptively recalibrating its channel-wise responses. Besides, we introduce a cross-category center (CCC) loss to constrain the distribution of the latent variable subspaces and thus we can obtain more compact and distinct subspaces. Extensive experiments on both in-the-wild and controlled environment datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods based on a single RGB image and behaves on par with approaches based on multimodal input resources."
Rethinking the Image Fusion: A Fast Unified Image Fusion Network based on Proportional Maintenance of Gradient and Intensity,"In this paper, we propose a fast unified image fusion network based on proportional maintenance of gradient and intensity (PMGI), which can end-to-end realize a variety of image fusion tasks, including infrared and visible image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion, medical image fusion, multi-focus image fusion and pan-sharpening. We unify the image fusion problem into the texture and intensity proportional maintenance problem of the source images. On the one hand, the network is divided into gradient path and intensity path for information extraction. We perform feature reuse in the same path to avoid loss of information due to convolution. At the same time, we introduce the pathwise transfer block to exchange information between different paths, which can not only pre-fuse the gradient information and intensity information, but also enhance the information to be processed later. On the other hand, we define a uniform form of loss function based on these two kinds of information, which can adapt to different fusion tasks. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PMGI over the state-of-the-art in terms of both visual effect and quantitative metric in a variety of fusion tasks. In addition, our method is faster compared with the state-of-the-art."
Model Watermarking for Image Processing Networks,"Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in numerous industrial applications. As training a good model often needs massive high-quality data and computation resources, the learned models often have significant business values. However, these valuable deep models are exposed to a huge risk of infringements. For example, if the attacker has the full information of one target model including the network structure and weights, the model can be easily finetuned on new datasets. Even if the attacker can only access the output of the target model, he/she can still train another similar surrogate model by generating a large scale of input-output training pairs. How to protect the intellectual property of deep models is a very important but seriously under-researched problem. There are a few recent attempts at classification network protection only.In this paper, we propose the first model watermarking framework for protecting image processing models. To achieve this goal, we leverage the spatial invisible watermarking mechanism. Specifically, given a black-box target model, a unified and invisible watermark is hidden into its outputs, which can be regarded as a special task-agnostic barrier. In this way, when the attacker trains one surrogate model by using the input-output pairs of the target model, the hidden watermark will be learned and extracted afterward. To enable watermarks from binary bits to high-resolution images, both traditional and deep spatial invisible watermarking mechanism are considered. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of the proposed watermarking mechanism, which can resist surrogate models learned with different network structures and objective functions. Besides deep models, the proposed method is also easy to be extended to protect data and traditional image processing algorithms."
Deep Object Co-Segmentation via Spatial-Semantic Network Modulation,"Object co-segmentation is to segment the shared objects in multiple relevant images, which has numerous applications in computer vision. This paper presents a spatial and semantic modulated deep network framework for object co-segmentation. A backbone network is adopted to extract multi-resolution image features. With the multi-resolution features of the relevant images as input, we design a spatial modulator to learn a mask for each image. The spatial modulator captures the correlations of image feature descriptors via unsupervised learning. The learned mask can roughly localize the shared foreground object while suppressing the background. For the semantic modulator, we model it as a supervised image classification task. We propose a hierarchical second-order pooling module to transform the image features for classification use. The outputs of the two modulators manipulate the multi-resolution features by a shift-and-scale operation so that the features focus on segmenting co-object regions. The proposed model is trained end-to-end without any intricate post-processing. Extensive experiments on four image co-segmentation benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at http://kaihuazhang.net/."
Pixel-Aware Deep Function-Mixture Network for Spectral Super-Resolution,"Spectral super-resolution (SSR) aims at generating a hyperspectral image (HSI) from a given RGB image. Recently, a promising direction is to learn a complicated mapping function from the RGB image to the HSI counterpart using a deep convolutional neural network. This essentially involves mapping the RGB context within a size-specific receptive field centered at each pixel to its spectrum in the HSI. The focus thereon is to appropriately determine the receptive field size and establish the mapping function from RGB context to the corresponding spectrum. Due to their differences in category or spatial position, pixels in HSIs often require different-sized receptive fields and distinct mapping functions. However, few efforts have been invested to explicitly exploit this prior.To address this problem, we propose a pixel-aware deep function-mixture network for SSR, which is composed of a new class of modules, termed function-mixture (FM) blocks. Each FM block is equipped with some basis functions, i.e., parallel subnets of different-sized receptive fields. Besides, it incorporates an extra subnet as a mixing function to generate pixel-wise weights, and then linearly mixes the outputs of all basis functions with those generated weights. This enables us to pixel-wisely determine the receptive field size and the mapping function. Moreover, we stack several such FM blocks to further increase the flexibility of the network in learning the pixel-wise mapping. To encourage feature reuse, intermediate features generated by the FM blocks are fused in late stage, which proves to be effective for boosting the SSR performance. Experimental results on three benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."
RIS-GAN: Explore Residual and Illumination with Generative Adversarial Networks for Shadow Removal,"Residual images and illumination estimation have been proved very helpful in image enhancement. In this paper, we propose a general and novel framework RIS-GAN which explores residual and illumination with Generative Adversarial Networks for shadow removal. Combined with the coarse shadow-removal image, the estimated negative residual images and inverse illumination maps can be used to generate indirect shadow-removal images to refine the coarse shadow-removal result to the fine shadow-free image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Three discriminators are designed to distinguish whether the predicted negative residual images, shadow-removal images, and the inverse illumination maps are real or fake jointly compared with the corresponding ground-truth information. To our best knowledge, we are the first one to explore residual and illumination for shadow removal. We evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark datasets, i.e., SRD and ISTD, and the extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the superior performance to state-of-the-arts, although we have no particular shadow-aware components designed in our generators."
3D Crowd Counting via Multi-View Fusion with 3D Gaussian Kernels,"Crowd counting has been studied for decades and a lot of works have achieved good performance, especially the DNNs-based density map estimation methods. Most existing crowd counting works focus on single-view counting, while few works have studied multi-view counting for large and wide scenes, where multiple cameras are used. Recently, an end-to-end multi-view crowd counting method called multi-view multi-scale (MVMS) has been proposed, which fuses multiple camera views using a CNN to predict a 2D scene-level density map on the ground-plane. Unlike MVMS, we propose to solve the multi-view crowd counting task through 3D feature fusion with 3D scene-level density maps, instead of the 2D ground-plane ones. Compared to 2D fusion, the 3D fusion extracts more information of the people along z-dimension (height), which helps to solve the scale variations across multiple views. The 3D density maps still preserve the 2D density maps property that the sum is the count, while also providing 3D information about the crowd density. We also explore the projection consistency among the 3D prediction and the ground-truth in the 2D views to further enhance the counting performance. The proposed method is tested on 3 multi-view counting datasets and achieves better or comparable counting performance to the state-of-the-art."
Deep Camouflage Images,"This paper addresses the problem of creating camouflage images. Such images typically contain one or more hidden objects embedded into a background image, so that viewers are required to consciously focus to discover them. Previous methods basically rely on hand-crafted features and texture synthesis to create camouflage images. However, due to lack of reliable understanding of what essentially makes an object recognizable, they typically result in either complete standout or complete invisible hidden objects. Moreover, they may fail to produce seamless and natural images because of the sensitivity to appearance differences. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel neural style transfer approach that adopts the visual perception mechanism to create camouflage images, which allows us to hide objects more effectively while producing natural-looking results. In particular, we design an attention-aware camouflage loss to adaptively mask out information that make the hidden objects visually standout, and also leave subtle yet enough feature clues for viewers to perceive the hidden objects. To remove the appearance discontinuities between the hidden objects and the background, we formulate a naturalness regularization to constrain the hidden objects to maintain the manifold structure of the covered background. Extensive experiments show the advantages of our approach over existing camouflage methods and state-of-the-art neural style transfer algorithms."
AutoRemover: Automatic Object Removal for Autonomous Driving Videos,"Motivated by the need for photo-realistic simulation in autonomous driving, in this paper we present a video inpainting algorithm AutoRemover, designed specifically for generating street-view videos without any moving objects. In our setup we have two challenges: the first is the shadow, shadows are usually unlabeled but tightly coupled with the moving objects. The second is the large ego-motion in the videos. To deal with shadows, we build up an autonomous driving shadow dataset and design a deep neural network to detect shadows automatically. To deal with large ego-motion, we take advantage of the multi-source data, in particular the 3D data, in autonomous driving. More specifically, the geometric relationship between frames is incorporated into an inpainting deep neural network to produce high-quality structurally consistent video output. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) object removal algorithms, reducing the RMSE by over 19%."
Knowledge Integration Networks for Action Recognition,"In this work, we propose Knowledge Integration Networks (referred as KINet) for video action recognition. KINet is capable of aggregating meaningful context features which are of great importance to identifying an action, such as human information and scene context. We design a three-branch architecture consisting of a main branch for action recognition, and two auxiliary branches for human parsing and scene recognition which allow the model to encode the knowledge of human and scene for action recognition. We explore two pre-trained models as teacher networks to distill the knowledge of human and scene for training the auxiliary tasks of KINet. Furthermore, we propose a two-level knowledge encoding mechanism which contains a Cross Branch Integration (CBI) module for encoding the auxiliary knowledge into medium-level convolutional features, and an Action Knowledge Graph (AKG) for effectively fusing high-level context information. This results in an end-to-end trainable framework where the three tasks can be trained collaboratively, allowing the model to compute strong context knowledge efficiently. The proposed KINet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale action recognition benchmark Kinetics-400, with a top-1 accuracy of 77.8%. We further demonstrate that our KINet has strong capability by transferring the Kinetics-trained model to UCF-101, where it obtains 97.8% top-1 accuracy."
Learning 2D Temporal Adjacent Networks for Moment Localization with Natural Language,"We address the problem of retrieving a specific moment from an untrimmed video by a query sentence. This is a challenging problem because a target moment may take place in relations to other temporal moments in the untrimmed video. Existing methods cannot tackle this challenge well since they consider temporal moments individually and neglect the temporal dependencies. In this paper, we model the temporal relations between video moments by a two-dimensional map, where one dimension indicates the starting time of a moment and the other indicates the end time. This 2D temporal map can cover diverse video moments with different lengths, while representing their adjacent relations. Based on the 2D map, we propose a Temporal Adjacent Network (2D-TAN), a single-shot framework for moment localization. It is capable of encoding the adjacent temporal relation, while learning discriminative features for matching video moments with referring expressions. We evaluate the proposed 2D-TAN on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., Charades-STA, ActivityNet Captions, and TACoS, where our 2D-TAN outperforms the state-of-the-art."
Single Camera Training for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (ReID) aims at finding the same person in different cameras. Training such systems usually requires a large amount of cross-camera pedestrians to be annotated from surveillance videos, which is labor-consuming especially when the number of cameras is large. Differently, this paper investigates ReID in an unexplored single-camera-training (SCT) setting, where each person in the training set appears in only one camera. To the best of our knowledge, this setting was never studied before. SCT enjoys the advantage of low-cost data collection and annotation, and thus eases ReID systems to be trained in a brand new environment. However, it raises major challenges due to the lack of cross-camera person occurrences, which conventional approaches heavily rely on to extract discriminative features. The key to dealing with the challenges in the SCT setting lies in designing an effective mechanism to complement cross-camera annotation. We start with a regular deep network for feature extraction, upon which we propose a novel loss function named multi-camera negative loss (MCNL). This is a metric learning loss motivated by probability, suggesting that in a multi-camera system, one image is more likely to be closer to the most similar negative sample in other cameras than to the most similar negative sample in the same camera. In experiments, MCNL significantly boosts ReID accuracy in the SCT setting, which paves the way of fast deployment of ReID systems with good performance on new target scenes."
Multi-Instance Multi-Label Action Recognition and Localization Based on Spatio-Temporal Pre-Trimming for Untrimmed Videos,"Weakly supervised action recognition and localization for untrimmed videos is a challenging problem with extensive applications. The overwhelming irrelevant background contents in untrimmed videos severely hamper effective identification of actions of interest. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-instance multi-label modeling network based on spatio-temporal pre-trimming to recognize actions and locate corresponding frames in untrimmed videos. Motivated by the fact that person is the key factor in a human action, we spatially and temporally segment each untrimmed video into person-centric clips with pose estimation and tracking techniques. Given the bag-of-instances structure associated with video-level labels, action recognition is naturally formulated as a multi-instance multi-label learning problem. The network is optimized iteratively with selective coarse-to-fine pre-trimming based on instance-label activation. After convergence, temporal localization is further achieved with local-global temporal class activation map. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e. THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, and experimental results clearly corroborate the efficacy of our method when compared with the state-of-the-arts."
FACT: Fused Attention for Clothing Transfer with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Clothing transfer is a challenging task in computer vision where the goal is to transfer the human clothing style in an input image conditioned on a given language description. However, existing approaches have limited ability in delicate colorization and texture synthesis with a conventional fully convolutional generator. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel semantic-based Fused Attention model for Clothing Transfer (FACT), which allows fine-grained synthesis, high global consistency and plausible hallucination in images. Towards this end, we incorporate two attention modules based on spatial levels: (i) soft attention that searches for the most related positions in sentences, and (ii) self-attention modeling long-range dependencies on feature maps. Furthermore, we also develop a stylized channel-wise attention module to capture correlations on feature levels. We effectively fuse these attention modules in the generator and achieve better performances than the state-of-the-art method on the DeepFashion dataset. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons against the baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Find Objects and Focus on Highlights: Mining Object Semantics for Video Highlight Detection via Graph Neural Networks,"With the increasing prevalence of portable computing devices, browsing unedited videos is time-consuming and tedious. Video highlight detection has the potential to significantly ease this situation, which discoveries moments of user's major or special interest in a video. Existing methods suffer from two problems. Firstly, most existing approaches only focus on learning holistic visual representations of videos but ignore object semantics for inferring video highlights. Secondly, current state-of-the-art approaches often adopt the pairwise ranking-based strategy, which cannot enjoy the global information to infer highlights. Therefore, we propose a novel video highlight framework, named VH-GNN, to construct an object-aware graph and model the relationships between objects from a global view. To reduce computational cost, we decompose the whole graph into two types of graphs: a spatial graph to capture the complex interactions of object within each frame, and a temporal graph to obtain object-aware representation of each frame and capture the global information. In addition, we optimize the framework via a proposed multi-stage loss, where the first stage aims to determine the highlight-probability and the second stage leverage the relationships between frames and focus on hard examples from the former stage. Extensive experiments on two standard datasets strongly evidence that VH-GNN obtains significant performance compared with state-of-the-arts."
When Radiology Report Generation Meets Knowledge Graph,"Automatic radiology report generation has been an attracting research problem towards computer-aided diagnosis to alleviate the workload of doctors in recent years. Deep learning techniques for natural image captioning are successfully adapted to generating radiology reports. However, radiology image reporting is different from the natural image captioning task in two aspects: 1) the accuracy of positive disease keyword mentions is critical in radiology image reporting in comparison to the equivalent importance of every single word in a natural image caption; 2) the evaluation of reporting quality should focus more on matching the disease keywords and their associated attributes instead of counting the occurrence of N-gram. Based on these concerns, we propose to utilize a pre-constructed graph embedding module (modeled with a graph convolutional neural network) on multiple disease findings to assist the generation of reports in this work. The incorporation of knowledge graph allows for dedicated feature learning for each disease finding and the relationship modeling between them. In addition, we proposed a new evaluation metric for radiology image reporting with the assistance of the same composed graph. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the methods integrated with the proposed graph embedding module on a publicly accessible dataset (IU-RR) of chest radiographs compared with previous approaches using both the conventional evaluation metrics commonly adopted for image captioning and our proposed ones."
Exploiting Motion Information from Unlabeled Videos for Static Image Action Recognition,"Static image action recognition, which aims to recognize action based on a single image, usually relies on expensive human labeling effort such as adequate labeled action images and large-scale labeled image dataset. In contrast, abundant unlabeled videos can be economically obtained. Therefore, several works have explored using unlabeled videos to facilitate image action recognition, which can be categorized into the following two groups: (a) enhance visual representations of action images with a designed proxy task on unlabeled videos, which falls into the scope of self-supervised learning; (b) generate auxiliary representations for action images with the generator learned from unlabeled videos. In this paper, we integrate the above two strategies in a unified framework, which consists of Visual Representation Enhancement (VRE) module and Motion Representation Augmentation (MRA) module. Specifically, the VRE module includes a proxy task which imposes pseudo motion label constraint and temporal coherence constraint on unlabeled videos, while the MRA module could predict the motion information of a static action image by exploiting unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework based on four benchmark human action datasets with limited labeled data."
Adaptive Unimodal Cost Volume Filtering for Deep Stereo Matching,"State-of-the-art deep learning based stereo matching approaches treat disparity estimation as a regression problem, where loss function is directly defined on true disparities and their estimated ones. However, disparity is just a byproduct of a matching process modeled by cost volume, while indirectly learning cost volume driven by disparity regression is prone to overfitting since the cost volume is under constrained. In this paper, we propose to directly add constraints to the cost volume by filtering cost volume with unimodal distribution peaked at true disparities. In addition, variances of the unimodal distributions for each pixel are estimated to explicitly model matching uncertainty under different contexts. The proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on Scene Flow and two KITTI stereo benchmarks. In particular, our method ranked the 1st place of KITTI 2012 evaluation and the 4th place of KITTI 2015 evaluation (recorded on 2019.8.20). The codes of AcfNet are available at: https://github.com/youmi-zym/AcfNet."
Fully Convolutional Network for Consistent Voxel-Wise Correspondence,"In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional network-based dense map from voxels to invertible pair of displacement vector fields regarding a template grid for the consistent voxel-wise correspondence. We parameterize the volumetric mapping using a convolutional network and train it in an unsupervised way by leveraging the spatial transformer to minimize the gap between the warped volumetric image and the template grid. Instead of learning the unidirectional map, we learn the nonlinear mapping functions for both forward and backward transformations. We introduce the combinational inverse constraints for the volumetric one-to-one maps, where the pairwise and triple constraints are utilized to learn the cycle-consistent correspondence maps between volumes. Experiments on both synthetic and clinically captured volumetric cone-beam CT (CBCT) images show that the proposed framework is effective and competitive against state-of-the-art deformable registration techniques."
Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval via Graph Convolution Network,"Zero-Shot Sketch-based Image Retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has been proposed recently, putting the traditional Sketch-based Image Retrieval (SBIR) under the setting of zero-shot learning. Dealing with both the challenges in SBIR and zero-shot learning makes it become a more difficult task. Previous works mainly focus on utilizing one kind of information, i.e., the visual information or the semantic information. In this paper, we propose a SketchGCN model utilizing the graph convolution network, which simultaneously considers both the visual information and the semantic information. Thus, our model can effectively narrow the domain gap and transfer the knowledge. Furthermore, we generate the semantic information from the visual information using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder rather than only map them back from the visual space to the semantic space, which enhances the generalization ability of our model. Besides, feature loss, classification loss, and semantic loss are introduced to optimize our proposed SketchGCN model. Our model gets a good performance on the challenging Sketchy and TU-Berlin datasets."
JSNet: Joint Instance and Semantic Segmentation of 3D Point Clouds,"In this paper, we propose a novel joint instance and semantic segmentation approach, which is called JSNet, in order to address the instance and semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds simultaneously. Firstly, we build an effective backbone network to extract robust features from the raw point clouds. Secondly, to obtain more discriminative features, a point cloud feature fusion module is proposed to fuse the different layer features of the backbone network. Furthermore, a joint instance semantic segmentation module is developed to transform semantic features into instance embedding space, and then the transformed features are further fused with instance features to facilitate instance segmentation. Meanwhile, this module also aggregates instance features into semantic feature space to promote semantic segmentation. Finally, the instance predictions are generated by applying a simple mean-shift clustering on instance embeddings. As a result, we evaluate the proposed JSNet on a large-scale 3D indoor point cloud dataset S3DIS and a part dataset ShapeNet, and compare it with existing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method in 3D instance segmentation with a significant improvement in 3D semantic prediction and our method is also beneficial for part segmentation. The source code for this work is available at https://github.com/dlinzhao/JSNet."
Spherical Criteria for Fast and Accurate 360° Object Detection,"With the advance of omnidirectional panoramic technology, 360◦ imagery has become increasingly popular in the past few years. To better understand the 360◦ content, many works resort to the 360◦ object detection and various criteria have been proposed to bound the objects and compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) between bounding boxes based on the common equirectangular projection (ERP) or perspective projection (PSP). However, the existing 360◦ criteria are either inaccurate or inefficient for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel spherical criteria for fast and accurate 360◦ object detection, including both spherical bounding boxes and spherical IoU (SphIoU). Based on the spherical criteria, we propose a novel two-stage 360◦ detector, i.e., Reprojection R-CNN, by combining the advantages of both ERP and PSP, yielding efficient and accurate 360◦ object detection. To validate the design of spherical criteria and Reprojection R-CNN, we construct two unbiased synthetic datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results reveal that compared with the existing criteria, the two-stage detector with spherical criteria achieves the best mAP results under the same inference speed, demonstrating that the spherical criteria can be more suitable for 360◦ object detection. Moreover, Reprojection R-CNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by over 30% on mAP with competitive speed, which confirms the efficiency and accuracy of the design."
GTNet: Generative Transfer Network for Zero-Shot Object Detection,"We propose a Generative Transfer Network (GTNet) for zero-shot object detection (ZSD). GTNet consists of an Object Detection Module and a Knowledge Transfer Module. The Object Detection Module can learn large-scale seen domain knowledge. The Knowledge Transfer Module leverages a feature synthesizer to generate unseen class features, which are applied to train a new classification layer for the Object Detection Module. In order to synthesize features for each unseen class with both the intra-class variance and the IoU variance, we design an IoU-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IoUGAN) as the feature synthesizer, which can be easily integrated into GTNet. Specifically, IoUGAN consists of three unit models: Class Feature Generating Unit (CFU), Foreground Feature Generating Unit (FFU), and Background Feature Generating Unit (BFU). CFU generates unseen features with the intra-class variance conditioned on the class semantic embeddings. FFU and BFU add the IoU variance to the results of CFU, yielding class-specific foreground and background features, respectively. We evaluate our method on three public datasets and the results demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art ZSD approaches."
Multi-Source Distilling Domain Adaptation,"Deep neural networks suffer from performance decay when there is domain shift between the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain, which motivates the research on domain adaptation (DA). Conventional DA methods usually assume that the labeled data is sampled from a single source distribution. However, in practice, labeled data may be collected from multiple sources, while naive application of the single-source DA algorithms may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-source distilling domain adaptation (MDDA) network, which not only considers the different distances among multiple sources and the target, but also investigates the different similarities of the source samples to the target ones. Specifically, the proposed MDDA includes four stages: (1) pre-train the source classifiers separately using the training data from each source; (2) adversarially map the target into the feature space of each source respectively by minimizing the empirical Wasserstein distance between source and target; (3) select the source training samples that are closer to the target to fine-tune the source classifiers; and (4) classify each encoded target feature by corresponding source classifier, and aggregate different predictions using respective domain weight, which corresponds to the discrepancy between each source and target. Extensive experiments are conducted on public DA benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed MDDA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Our source code is released at: https://github.com/daoyuan98/MDDA."
MemCap: Memorizing Style Knowledge for Image Captioning,"Generating stylized captions for images is a challenging task since it requires not only describing the content of the image accurately but also expressing the desired linguistic style appropriately. In this paper, we propose MemCap, a novel stylized image captioning method that explicitly encodes the knowledge about linguistic styles with memory mechanism. Rather than relying heavily on a language model to capture style factors in existing methods, our method resorts to memorizing stylized elements learned from training corpus. Particularly, we design a memory module that comprises a set of embedding vectors for encoding style-related phrases in training corpus. To acquire the style-related phrases, we develop a sentence decomposing algorithm that splits a stylized sentence into a style-related part that reflects the linguistic style and a content-related part that contains the visual content. When generating captions, our MemCap first extracts content-relevant style knowledge from the memory module via an attention mechanism and then incorporates the extracted knowledge into a language model. Extensive experiments on two stylized image captioning datasets (SentiCap and FlickrStyle10K) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Distance-IoU Loss: Faster and Better Learning for Bounding Box Regression,"Bounding box regression is the crucial step in object detection. In existing methods, while ℓn-norm loss is widely adopted for bounding box regression, it is not tailored to the evaluation metric, i.e., Intersection over Union (IoU). Recently, IoU loss and generalized IoU (GIoU) loss have been proposed to benefit the IoU metric, but still suffer from the problems of slow convergence and inaccurate regression. In this paper, we propose a Distance-IoU (DIoU) loss by incorporating the normalized distance between the predicted box and the target box, which converges much faster in training than IoU and GIoU losses. Furthermore, this paper summarizes three geometric factors in bounding box regression, i.e., overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio, based on which a Complete IoU (CIoU) loss is proposed, thereby leading to faster convergence and better performance. By incorporating DIoU and CIoU losses into state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, e.g., YOLO v3, SSD and Faster R-CNN, we achieve notable performance gains in terms of not only IoU metric but also GIoU metric. Moreover, DIoU can be easily adopted into non-maximum suppression (NMS) to act as the criterion, further boosting performance improvement. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU."
Random Erasing Data Augmentation,"In this paper, we introduce Random Erasing, a new data augmentation method for training the convolutional neural network (CNN). In training, Random Erasing randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values. In this process, training images with various levels of occlusion are generated, which reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the model robust to occlusion. Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhunzhong07/Random-Erasing."
Spatial-Temporal Multi-Cue Network for Continuous Sign Language Recognition,"Despite the recent success of deep learning in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR), deep models typically focus on the most discriminative features, ignoring other potentially non-trivial and informative contents. Such characteristic heavily constrains their capability to learn implicit visual grammars behind the collaboration of different visual cues (i,e., hand shape, facial expression and body posture). By injecting multi-cue learning into neural network design, we propose a spatial-temporal multi-cue (STMC) network to solve the vision-based sequence learning problem. Our STMC network consists of a spatial multi-cue (SMC) module and a temporal multi-cue (TMC) module. The SMC module is dedicated to spatial representation and explicitly decomposes visual features of different cues with the aid of a self-contained pose estimation branch. The TMC module models temporal correlations along two parallel paths, i.e., intra-cue and inter-cue, which aims to preserve the uniqueness and explore the collaboration of multiple cues. Finally, we design a joint optimization strategy to achieve the end-to-end sequence learning of the STMC network. To validate the effectiveness, we perform experiments on three large-scale CSLR benchmarks: PHOENIX-2014, CSL and PHOENIX-2014-T. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on all three benchmarks."
Discriminative and Robust Online Learning for Siamese Visual Tracking,"The problem of visual object tracking has traditionally been handled by variant tracking paradigms, either learning a model of the object's appearance exclusively online or matching the object with the target in an offline-trained embedding space. Despite the recent success, each method agonizes over its intrinsic constraint. The online-only approaches suffer from a lack of generalization of the model they learn thus are inferior in target regression, while the offline-only approaches (e.g., convolutional siamese trackers) lack the target-specific context information thus are not discriminative enough to handle distractors, and robust enough to deformation. Therefore, we propose an online module with an attention mechanism for offline siamese networks to extract target-specific features under L2 error. We further propose a filter update strategy adaptive to treacherous background noises for discriminative learning, and a template update strategy to handle large target deformations for robust learning. Effectiveness can be validated in the consistent improvement over three siamese baselines: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamMask. Beyond that, our model based on SiamRPN++ obtains the best results over six popular tracking benchmarks and can operate beyond real-time."
Deep Domain-Adversarial Image Generation for Domain Generalisation,"Machine learning models typically suffer from the domain shift problem when trained on a source dataset and evaluated on a target dataset of different distribution. To overcome this problem, domain generalisation (DG) methods aim to leverage data from multiple source domains so that a trained model can generalise to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a novel DG approach based on Deep Domain-Adversarial Image Generation (DDAIG). Specifically, DDAIG consists of three components, namely a label classifier, a domain classifier and a domain transformation network (DoTNet). The goal for DoTNet is to map the source training data to unseen domains. This is achieved by having a learning objective formulated to ensure that the generated data can be correctly classified by the label classifier while fooling the domain classifier. By augmenting the source training data with the generated unseen domain data, we can make the label classifier more robust to unknown domain changes. Extensive experiments on four DG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Progressive Bi-C3D Pose Grammar for Human Pose Estimation,"In this paper, we propose a progressive pose grammar network learned with Bi-C3D (Bidirectional Convolutional 3D) for human pose estimation. Exploiting the dependencies among the human body parts proves effective in solving the problems such as complex articulation, occlusion and so on. Therefore, we propose two articulated grammars learned with Bi-C3D to build the relationships of the human joints and exploit the contextual information of human body structure. Firstly, a local multi-scale Bi-C3D kinematics grammar is proposed to promote the message passing process among the locally related joints. The multi-scale kinematics grammar excavates different levels human context learned by the network. Moreover, a global sequential grammar is put forward to capture the long-range dependencies among the human body joints. The whole procedure can be regarded as a local-global progressive refinement process. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves competitive performance on both MPII and LSP benchmarks compared with previous methods, which confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of C3D in information interactions."
Unified Vision-Language Pre-Training for Image Captioning and VQA,"This paper presents a unified Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) model. The model is unified in that (1) it can be fine-tuned for either vision-language generation (e.g., image captioning) or understanding (e.g., visual question answering) tasks, and (2) it uses a shared multi-layer transformer network for both encoding and decoding, which differs from many existing methods where the encoder and decoder are implemented using separate models. The unified VLP model is pre-trained on a large amount of image-text pairs using the unsupervised learning objectives of two tasks: bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) masked vision-language prediction. The two tasks differ solely in what context the prediction conditions on. This is controlled by utilizing specific self-attention masks for the shared transformer network. To the best of our knowledge, VLP is the first reported model that achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision-language generation and understanding tasks, as disparate as image captioning and visual question answering, across three challenging benchmark datasets: COCO Captions, Flickr30k Captions, and VQA 2.0. The code and the pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/LuoweiZhou/VLP."
Ladder Loss for Coherent Visual-Semantic Embedding,"For visual-semantic embedding, the existing methods normally treat the relevance between queries and candidates in a bipolar way – relevant or irrelevant, and all “irrelevant” candidates are uniformly pushed away from the query by an equal margin in the embedding space, regardless of their various proximity to the query. This practice disregards relatively discriminative information and could lead to suboptimal ranking in the retrieval results and poorer user experience, especially in the long-tail query scenario where a matching candidate may not necessarily exist. In this paper, we introduce a continuous variable to model the relevance degree between queries and multiple candidates, and propose to learn a coherent embedding space, where candidates with higher relevance degrees are mapped closer to the query than those with lower relevance degrees. In particular, the new ladder loss is proposed by extending the triplet loss inequality to a more general inequality chain, which implements variable push-away margins according to respective relevance degrees. In addition, a proper Coherent Score metric is proposed to better measure the ranking results including those “irrelevant” candidates. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed method, which achieves significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods."
"Generate, Segment, and Refine: Towards Generic Manipulation Segmentation","Detecting manipulated images has become a significant emerging challenge. The advent of image sharing platforms and the easy availability of advanced photo editing software have resulted in a large quantities of manipulated images being shared on the internet. While the intent behind such manipulations varies widely, concerns on the spread of false news and misinformation is growing. Current state of the art methods for detecting these manipulated images suffers from the lack of training data due to the laborious labeling process. We address this problem in this paper, for which we introduce a manipulated image generation process that creates true positives using currently available datasets. Drawing from traditional work on image blending, we propose a novel generator for creating such examples. In addition, we also propose to further create examples that force the algorithm to focus on boundary artifacts during training. Strong experimental results validate our proposal."
Motion-Attentive Transition for Zero-Shot Video Object Segmentation,"In this paper, we present a novel Motion-Attentive Transition Network (MATNet) for zero-shot video object segmentation, which provides a new way of leveraging motion information to reinforce spatio-temporal object representation. An asymmetric attention block, called Motion-Attentive Transition (MAT), is designed within a two-stream encoder, which transforms appearance features into motion-attentive representations at each convolutional stage. In this way, the encoder becomes deeply interleaved, allowing for closely hierarchical interactions between object motion and appearance. This is superior to the typical two-stream architecture, which treats motion and appearance separately in each stream and often suffers from overfitting to appearance information. Additionally, a bridge network is proposed to obtain a compact, discriminative and scale-sensitive representation for multi-level encoder features, which is further fed into a decoder to achieve segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS-16, FBMS and Youtube-Objects) show that our model achieves compelling performance against the state-of-the-arts. Code is available at: https://github.com/tfzhou/MATNet."
When AWGN-Based Denoiser Meets Real Noises,"Discriminative learning based image denoisers have achieved promising performance on synthetic noises such as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The synthetic noises adopted in most previous work are pixel-independent, but real noises are mostly spatially/channel-correlated and spatially/channel-variant. This domain gap yields unsatisfied performance on images with real noises if the model is only trained with AWGN. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to boost the performance of a real image denoiser which is trained only with synthetic pixel-independent noise data dominated by AWGN. First, we train a deep model that consists of a noise estimator and a denoiser with mixed AWGN and Random Value Impulse Noise (RVIN). We then investigate Pixel-shuffle Down-sampling (PD) strategy to adapt the trained model to real noises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed approach. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on real sRGB images in the DND benchmark among models trained with synthetic noises. Codes are available at https://github.com/yzhouas/PD-Denoising-pytorch."
Multi-Type Self-Attention Guided Degraded Saliency Detection,"Existing saliency detection techniques are sensitive to image quality and perform poorly on degraded images. In this paper, we systematically analyze the current status of the research on detecting salient objects from degraded images and then propose a new multi-type self-attention network, namely MSANet, for degraded saliency detection. The main contributions include: 1) Applying attention transfer learning to promote semantic detail perception and internal feature mining of the target network on degraded images; 2) Developing a multi-type self-attention mechanism to achieve the weight recalculation of multi-scale features. By computing global and local attention scores, we obtain the weighted features of different scales, effectively suppress the interference of noise and redundant information, and achieve a more complete boundary extraction. The proposed MSANet converts low-quality inputs to high-quality saliency maps directly in an end-to-end fashion. Experiments on seven widely-used datasets show that our approach produces good performance on both clear and degraded images."
Towards Omni-Supervised Face Alignment for Large Scale Unlabeled Videos,"In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal relational reasoning networks (STRRN) approach to investigate the problem of omni-supervised face alignment in videos. Unlike existing fully supervised methods which rely on numerous annotations by hand, our learner exploits large scale unlabeled videos plus available labeled data to generate auxiliary plausible training annotations. Motivated by the fact that neighbouring facial landmarks are usually correlated and coherent across consecutive frames, our approach automatically reasons about discriminative spatial-temporal relationships among landmarks for stable face tracking. Specifically, we carefully develop an interpretable and efficient network module, which disentangles facial geometry relationship for every static frame and simultaneously enforces the bi-directional cycle-consistency across adjacent frames, thus allowing the modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal relations from raw face sequences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of most fully supervised state-of-the-arts."
FASTER Recurrent Networks for Efficient Video Classification,"Typical video classification methods often divide a video into short clips, do inference on each clip independently, then aggregate the clip-level predictions to generate the video-level results. However, processing visually similar clips independently ignores the temporal structure of the video sequence, and increases the computational cost at inference time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named FASTER, i.e., Feature Aggregation for Spatio-TEmporal Redundancy. FASTER aims to leverage the redundancy between neighboring clips and reduce the computational cost by learning to aggregate the predictions from models of different complexities. The FASTER framework can integrate high quality representations from expensive models to capture subtle motion information and lightweight representations from cheap models to cover scene changes in the video. A new recurrent network (i.e., FAST-GRU) is designed to aggregate the mixture of different representations. Compared with existing approaches, FASTER can reduce the FLOPs by over 10× while maintaining the state-of-the-art accuracy across popular datasets, such as Kinetics, UCF-101 and HMDB-51."
EEMEFN: Low-Light Image Enhancement via Edge-Enhanced Multi-Exposure Fusion Network,"This work focuses on the extremely low-light image enhancement, which aims to improve image brightness and reveal hidden information in darken areas. Recently, image enhancement approaches have yielded impressive progress. However, existing methods still suffer from three main problems: (1) low-light images usually are high-contrast. Existing methods may fail to recover images details in extremely dark or bright areas; (2) current methods cannot precisely correct the color of low-light images; (3) when the object edges are unclear, the pixel-wise loss may treat pixels of different objects equally and produce blurry images. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method called Edge-Enhanced Multi-Exposure Fusion Network (EEMEFN) to enhance extremely low-light images. In the first stage, we employ a multi-exposure fusion module to address the high contrast and color bias issues. We synthesize a set of images with different exposure time from a single image and construct an accurate normal-light image by combining well-exposed areas under different illumination conditions. Thus, it can produce realistic initial images with correct color from extremely noisy and low-light images. Secondly, we introduce an edge enhancement module to refine the initial images with the help of the edge information. Therefore, our method can reconstruct high-quality images with sharp edges when minimizing the pixel-wise loss. Experiments on the See-in-the-Dark dataset indicate that our EEMEFN approach achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Viewpoint-Aware Loss with Angular Regularization for Person Re-Identification,"Although great progress in supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) has been made recently, due to the viewpoint variation of a person, Re-ID remains a massive visual challenge. Most existing viewpoint-based person Re-ID methods project images from each viewpoint into separated and unrelated sub-feature spaces. They only model the identity-level distribution inside an individual viewpoint but ignore the underlying relationship between different viewpoints. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, called Viewpoint-Aware Loss with Angular Regularization (VA-reID). Instead of one subspace for each viewpoint, our method projects the feature from different viewpoints into a unified hypersphere and effectively models the feature distribution on both the identity-level and the viewpoint-level. In addition, rather than modeling different viewpoints as hard labels used for conventional viewpoint classification, we introduce viewpoint-aware adaptive label smoothing regularization (VALSR) that assigns the adaptive soft label to feature representation. VALSR can effectively solve the ambiguity of the viewpoint cluster label assignment. Extensive experiments on the Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised Re-ID methods."
iFAN: Image-Instance Full Alignment Networks for Adaptive Object Detection,"Training an object detector on a data-rich domain and applying it to a data-poor one with limited performance drop is highly attractive in industry, because it saves huge annotation cost. Recent research on unsupervised domain adaptive object detection has verified that aligning data distributions between source and target images through adversarial learning is very useful. The key is when, where and how to use it to achieve best practice. We propose Image-Instance Full Alignment Networks (iFAN) to tackle this problem by precisely aligning feature distributions on both image and instance levels: 1) Image-level alignment: multi-scale features are roughly aligned by training adversarial domain classifiers in a hierarchically-nested fashion. 2) Full instance-level alignment: deep semantic information and elaborate instance representations are fully exploited to establish a strong relationship among categories and domains. Establishing these correlations is formulated as a metric learning problem by carefully constructing instance pairs. Above-mentioned adaptations can be integrated into an object detector (e.g. Faster R-CNN), resulting in an end-to-end trainable framework where multiple alignments can work collaboratively in a coarse-to-fine manner. In two domain adaptation tasks: synthetic-to-real (SIM10K → Cityscapes) and normal-to-foggy weather (Cityscapes → Foggy Cityscapes), iFAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with a boost of 10%+ AP over the source-only baseline."
Learning Attentive Pairwise Interaction for Fine-Grained Classification,"Fine-grained classification is a challenging problem, due to subtle differences among highly-confused categories. Most approaches address this difficulty by learning discriminative representation of individual input image. On the other hand, humans can effectively identify contrastive clues by comparing image pairs. Inspired by this fact, this paper proposes a simple but effective Attentive Pairwise Interaction Network (API-Net), which can progressively recognize a pair of fine-grained images by interaction. Specifically, API-Net first learns a mutual feature vector to capture semantic differences in the input pair. It then compares this mutual vector with individual vectors to generate gates for each input image. These distinct gate vectors inherit mutual context on semantic differences, which allow API-Net to attentively capture contrastive clues by pairwise interaction between two images. Additionally, we train API-Net in an end-to-end manner with a score ranking regularization, which can further generalize API-Net by taking feature priorities into account. We conduct extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks in fine-grained classification. API-Net outperforms the recent SOTA methods, i.e., CUB-200-2011 (90.0%), Aircraft (93.9%), Stanford Cars (95.3%), Stanford Dogs (90.3%), and NABirds (88.1%)."

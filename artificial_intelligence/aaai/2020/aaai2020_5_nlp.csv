Subsidy Allocations in the Presence of Income Shocks,"Poverty and economic hardship are understood to be highly complex and dynamic phenomena. Due to the multi-faceted nature of welfare, assistance programs targeted at alleviating hardship can face challenges, as they often rely on simpler welfare measurements, such as income or wealth, that fail to capture to full complexity of each family's state. Here, we explore one important dimension – susceptibility to income shocks. We introduce a model of welfare that incorporates income, wealth, and income shocks and analyze this model to show that it can vary, at times substantially, from measures of welfare that only use income or wealth. We then study the algorithmic problem of optimally allocating subsidies in the presence of income shocks. We consider two well-studied objectives: the first aims to minimize the expected number of agents that fall below a given welfare threshold (a min-sum objective) and the second aims to minimize the likelihood that the most vulnerable agent falls below this threshold (a min-max objective). We present optimal and near-optimal algorithms for various general settings. We close with a discussion on future directions on allocating societal resources and ethical implications of related approaches."
Parameterised Resource-Bounded ATL,"It is often advantageous to be able to extract resource requirements in resource logics of strategic ability, rather than to verify whether a fixed resource requirement is sufficient for achieving a goal. We study Parameterised Resource-Bounded Alternating Time Temporal Logic where parameter extraction is possible. We give a parameter extraction algorithm and prove that the model-checking problem is 2EXPTIME-complete."
Partner Selection for the Emergence of Cooperation in Multi-Agent Systems Using Reinforcement Learning,"Social dilemmas have been widely studied to explain how humans are able to cooperate in society. Considerable effort has been invested in designing artificial agents for social dilemmas that incorporate explicit agent motivations that are chosen to favor coordinated or cooperative responses. The prevalence of this general approach points towards the importance of achieving an understanding of both an agent's internal design and external environment dynamics that facilitate cooperative behavior. In this paper, we investigate how partner selection can promote cooperative behavior between agents who are trained to maximize a purely selfish objective function. Our experiments reveal that agents trained with this dynamic learn a strategy that retaliates against defectors while promoting cooperation with other agents resulting in a prosocial society."
Incentive-Compatible Classification,"We investigate the possibility of an incentive-compatible (IC, a.k.a. strategy-proof) mechanism for the classification of agents in a network according to their reviews of each other. In the α-classification problem we are interested in selecting the top α fraction of users. We give upper bounds (impossibilities) and lower bounds (mechanisms) on the worst-case coincidence between the classification of an IC mechanism and the ideal α-classification.We prove bounds which depend on α and on the maximal number of reviews given by a single agent, Δ. Our results show that it is harder to find a good mechanism when α is smaller and Δ is larger. In particular, if Δ is unbounded, then the best mechanism is trivial (that is, it does not take into account the reviews). On the other hand, when Δ is sublinear in the number of agents, we give a simple, natural mechanism, with a coincidence ratio of α."
Learning the Value of Teamwork to Form Efficient Teams,"In this paper we describe a novel approach to team formation based on the value of inter-agent interactions. Specifically, we propose a model of teamwork that considers outcomes from chains of interactions between agents. Based on our model, we devise a number of network metrics to capture the contribution of interactions between agents. This is then used to learn the value of teamwork from historical team performance data. We apply our model to predict team performance and validate our approach using real-world team performance data from the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Our model is shown to better predict the real-world performance of teams by up to 46% compared to models that ignore inter-agent interactions."
Model Checking Temporal Epistemic Logic under Bounded Recall,"We study the problem of verifying multi-agent systems under the assumption of bounded recall. We introduce the logic CTLKBR, a bounded-recall variant of the temporal-epistemic logic CTLK. We define and study the model checking problem against CTLK specifications under incomplete information and bounded recall and present complexity upper bounds. We present an extension of the BDD-based model checker MCMAS implementing model checking under bounded recall semantics and discuss the experimental results obtained."
ODSS: Efficient Hybridization for Optimal Coalition Structure Generation,"Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) is an NP-complete problem that remains difficult to solve on account of its complexity. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid algorithm for optimal coalition structure generation called ODSS. ODSS is a hybrid version of two previously established algorithms IDP (Rahwan and Jennings 2008) and IP (Rahwan et al. 2009). ODSS minimizes the overlapping between IDP and IP by dividing the whole search space of CSG into two disjoint sets of subspaces and proposes a novel subspace shrinking technique to reduce the size of the subspace searched by IP with the help of IDP. When compared to the state-of-the-art against a wide variety of value distributions, ODSS is shown to perform better by up to 54.15% on benchmark inputs."
HS-CAI: A Hybrid DCOP Algorithm via Combining Search with Context-Based Inference,"Search and inference are two main strategies for optimally solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs). Recently, several algorithms were proposed to combine their advantages. Unfortunately, such algorithms only use an approximated inference as a one-shot preprocessing phase to construct the initial lower bounds which lead to inefficient pruning under the limited memory budget. On the other hand, iterative inference algorithms (e.g., MB-DPOP) perform a context-based complete inference for all possible contexts but suffer from tremendous traffic overheads. In this paper, (i) hybridizing search with context-based inference, we propose a complete algorithm for DCOPs, named HS-CAI where the inference utilizes the contexts derived from the search process to establish tight lower bounds while the search uses such bounds for efficient pruning and thereby reduces contexts for the inference. Furthermore, (ii) we introduce a context evaluation mechanism to select the context patterns for the inference to further reduce the overheads incurred by iterative inferences. Finally, (iii) we prove the correctness of our algorithm and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art."
AATEAM: Achieving the Ad Hoc Teamwork by Employing the Attention Mechanism,"In the ad hoc teamwork setting, a team of agents needs to perform a task without prior coordination. The most advanced approach learns policies based on previous experiences and reuses one of the policies to interact with new teammates. However, the selected policy in many cases is sub-optimal. Switching between policies to adapt to new teammates' behaviour takes time, which threatens the successful performance of a task. In this paper, we propose AATEAM – a method that uses the attention-based neural networks to cope with new teammates' behaviour in real-time. We train one attention network per teammate type. The attention networks learn both to extract the temporal correlations from the sequence of states (i.e. contexts) and the mapping from contexts to actions. Each attention network also learns to predict a future state given the current context and its output action. The prediction accuracies help to determine which actions the ad hoc agent should take. We perform extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our method."
Convergence of Opinion Diffusion is PSPACE-Complete,"We analyse opinion diffusion in social networks, where a finite set of individuals is connected in a directed graph and each simultaneously changes their opinion to that of the majority of their influencers. We study the algorithmic properties of the fixed-point behaviour of such networks, showing that the problem of establishing whether individuals converge to stable opinions is PSPACE-complete."
A Particle Swarm Based Algorithm for Functional Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems,"Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are a widely studied constraint handling framework. The objective of a DCOP algorithm is to optimize a global objective function that can be described as the aggregation of several distributed constraint cost functions. In a DCOP, each of these functions is defined by a set of discrete variables. However, in many applications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor networks, continuous valued variables are more suited than the discrete ones. Considering this, Functional DCOPs (F-DCOPs) have been proposed that can explicitly model a problem containing continuous variables. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art F-DCOPs approaches experience onerous memory or computation overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new F-DCOP algorithm, namely Particle Swarm based F-DCOP (PFD), which is inspired by a meta-heuristic, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Although it has been successfully applied to many continuous optimization problems, the potential of PSO has not been utilized in F-DCOPs. To be exact, PFD devises a distributed method of solution construction while significantly reducing the computation and memory requirements. Moreover, we theoretically prove that PFD is an anytime algorithm. Finally, our empirical results indicate that PFD outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of solution quality and computation overhead."
An Operational Semantics for True Concurrency in BDI Agent Systems,"Agent programming languages have proved useful for formally modelling implemented systems such as PRS and JACK, and for reasoning about their behaviour. Over the past decades, many agent programming languages and extensions have been developed. A key feature in some of them is their support for the specification of ‘concurrent’ actions and programs. However, their notion of concurrency is still limited, as it amounts to a nondeterministic choice between (sequential) action interleavings. Thus, the notion does not represent ‘true concurrency’, which can more naturally exploit multi-core computers and multi-robot manufacturing cells. This paper provides a true concurrency operational semantics for a BDI agent programming language, allowing actions to overlap in execution. We prove key properties of the semantics, relating to true concurrency and to its link with interleaving."
Scalable Decision-Theoretic Planning in Open and Typed Multiagent Systems,"In open agent systems, the set of agents that are cooperating or competing changes over time and in ways that are nontrivial to predict. For example, if collaborative robots were tasked with fighting wildfires, they may run out of suppressants and be temporarily unavailable to assist their peers. We consider the problem of planning in these contexts with the additional challenges that the agents are unable to communicate with each other and that there are many of them. Because an agent's optimal action depends on the actions of others, each agent must not only predict the actions of its peers, but, before that, reason whether they are even present to perform an action. Addressing openness thus requires agents to model each other's presence, which becomes computationally intractable with high numbers of agents. We present a novel, principled, and scalable method in this context that enables an agent to reason about others' presence in its shared environment and their actions. Our method extrapolates models of a few peers to the overall behavior of the many-agent system, and combines it with a generalization of Monte Carlo tree search to perform individual agent reasoning in many-agent open environments. Theoretical analyses establish the number of agents to model in order to achieve acceptable worst case bounds on extrapolation error, as well as regret bounds on the agent's utility from modeling only some neighbors. Simulations of multiagent wildfire suppression problems demonstrate our approach's efficacy compared with alternative baselines."
Parameterized Complexity of Envy-Free Resource Allocation in Social Networks,"We consider the classical problem of allocating resources among agents in an envy-free (and, where applicable, proportional) way. Recently, the basic model was enriched by introducing the concept of a social network which allows to capture situations where agents might not have full information about the allocation of all resources. We initiate the study of the parameterized complexity of these resource allocation problems by considering natural parameters which capture structural properties of the network and similarities between agents and items. In particular, we show that even very general fragments of the considered problems become tractable as long as the social network has bounded treewidth or bounded clique-width. We complement our results with matching lower bounds which show that our algorithms cannot be substantially improved."
On the Convergence of Model Free Learning in Mean Field Games,"Learning by experience in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is a difficult and exciting task, due to the lack of stationarity of the environment, whose dynamics evolves as the population learns. In order to design scalable algorithms for systems with a large population of interacting agents (e.g., swarms), this paper focuses on Mean Field MAS, where the number of agents is asymptotically infinite. Recently, a very active burgeoning field studies the effects of diverse reinforcement learning algorithms for agents with no prior information on a stationary Mean Field Game (MFG) and learn their policy through repeated experience. We adopt a high perspective on this problem and analyze in full generality the convergence of a fictitious iterative scheme using any single agent learning algorithm at each step. We quantify the quality of the computed approximate Nash equilibrium, in terms of the accumulated errors arising at each learning iteration step. Notably, we show for the first time convergence of model free learning algorithms towards non-stationary MFG equilibria, relying only on classical assumptions on the MFG dynamics. We illustrate our theoretical results with a numerical experiment in a continuous action-space environment, where the approximate best response of the iterative fictitious play scheme is computed with a deep RL algorithm."
Implicit Coordination Using FOND Planning,"Epistemic planning can be used to achieve implicit coordination in cooperative multi-agent settings where knowledge and capabilities are distributed between the agents. In these scenarios, agents plan and act on their own without having to agree on a common plan or protocol beforehand. However, epistemic planning is undecidable in general. In this paper, we show how implicit coordination can be achieved in a simpler, propositional setting by using nondeterminism as a means to allow the agents to take the other agents' perspectives. We identify a decidable fragment of epistemic planning that allows for arbitrary initial state uncertainty and non-determinism, but where actions can never increase the uncertainty of the agents. We show that in this fragment, planning for implicit coordination can be reduced to a version of fully observable nondeterministic (FOND) planning and that it thus has the same computational complexity as FOND planning. We provide a small case study, modeling the problem of multi-agent path finding with destination uncertainty in FOND, to show that our approach can be successfully applied in practice."
Communication Learning via Backpropagation in Discrete Channels with Unknown Noise,"This work focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) with inter-agent communication, in which communication is differentiable and optimized through backpropagation. Such differentiable approaches tend to converge more quickly to higher-quality policies compared to techniques that treat communication as actions in a traditional RL framework. However, modern communication networks (e.g., Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) rely on discrete communication channels, for which existing differentiable approaches that consider real-valued messages cannot be directly applied, or require biased gradient estimators. Some works have overcome this problem by treating the message space as an extension of the action space, and use standard RL to optimize message selection, but these methods tend to converge slower and to inferior policies. In this paper, we propose a stochastic message encoding/decoding procedure that makes a discrete communication channel mathematically equivalent to an analog channel with additive noise, through which gradients can be backpropagated. Additionally, we introduce an encryption step for use in noisy channels that forces channel noise to be message-independent, allowing us to compute unbiased derivative estimates even in the presence of unknown channel noise. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first differentiable communication learning approach that can compute unbiased derivatives through channels with unknown noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two example multi-robot tasks: a path finding and a collaborative search problem. There, we show that our approach achieves learning speed and performance similar to differentiable communication learning with real-valued messages (i.e., unlimited communication bandwidth), while naturally handling more realistic real-world communication constraints. Content Areas: Multi-Agent Communication, Reinforcement Learning."
Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent with Event-Triggered Communication,"We develop a Distributed Event-Triggered Stochastic GRAdient Descent (DETSGRAD) algorithm for solving non-convex optimization problems typically encountered in distributed deep learning. We propose a novel communication triggering mechanism that would allow the networked agents to update their model parameters aperiodically and provide sufficient conditions on the algorithm step-sizes that guarantee the asymptotic mean-square convergence. The algorithm is applied to a distributed supervised-learning problem, in which a set of networked agents collaboratively train their individual neural networks to perform image classification, while aperiodically sharing the model parameters with their one-hop neighbors. Results indicate that all agents report similar performance that is also comparable to the performance of a centrally trained neural network, while the event-triggered communication provides significant reduction in inter-agent communication. Results also show that the proposed algorithm allows the individual agents to classify the images even though the training data corresponding to all the classes are not locally available to each agent."
Distributed Machine Learning through Heterogeneous Edge Systems,"Many emerging AI applications request distributed machine learning (ML) among edge systems (e.g., IoT devices and PCs at the edge of the Internet), where data cannot be uploaded to a central venue for model training, due to their large volumes and/or security/privacy concerns. Edge devices are intrinsically heterogeneous in computing capacity, posing significant challenges to parameter synchronization for parallel training with the parameter server (PS) architecture. This paper proposes ADSP, a parameter synchronization model for distributed machine learning (ML) with heterogeneous edge systems. Eliminating the significant waiting time occurring with existing parameter synchronization models, the core idea of ADSP is to let faster edge devices continue training, while committing their model updates at strategically decided intervals. We design algorithms that decide time points for each worker to commit its model update, and ensure not only global model convergence but also faster convergence. Our testbed implementation and experiments show that ADSP outperforms existing parameter synchronization models significantly in terms of ML model convergence time, scalability and adaptability to large heterogeneity."
Improving Policies via Search in Cooperative Partially Observable Games,"Recent superhuman results in games have largely been achieved in a variety of zero-sum settings, such as Go and Poker, in which agents need to compete against others. However, just like humans, real-world AI systems have to coordinate and communicate with other agents in cooperative partially observable environments as well. These settings commonly require participants to both interpret the actions of others and to act in a way that is informative when being interpreted. Those abilities are typically summarized as theory of mind and are seen as crucial for social interactions. In this paper we propose two different search techniques that can be applied to improve an arbitrary agreed-upon policy in a cooperative partially observable game. The first one, single-agent search, effectively converts the problem into a single agent setting by making all but one of the agents play according to the agreed-upon policy. In contrast, in multi-agent search all agents carry out the same common-knowledge search procedure whenever doing so is computationally feasible, and fall back to playing according to the agreed-upon policy otherwise. We prove that these search procedures are theoretically guaranteed to at least maintain the original performance of the agreed-upon policy (up to a bounded approximation error). In the benchmark challenge problem of Hanabi, our search technique greatly improves the performance of every agent we tested and when applied to a policy trained using RL achieves a new state-of-the-art score of 24.61 / 25 in the game, compared to a previous-best of 24.08 / 25."
Generative Attention Networks for Multi-Agent Behavioral Modeling,"Understanding and modeling behavior of multi-agent systems is a central step for artificial intelligence. Here we present a deep generative model which captures behavior generating process of multi-agent systems, supports accurate predictions and inference, infers how agents interact in a complex system, as well as identifies agent groups and interaction types. Built upon advances in deep generative models and a novel attention mechanism, our model can learn interactions in highly heterogeneous systems with linear complexity in the number of agents. We apply this model to three multi-agent systems in different domains and evaluate performance on a diverse set of tasks including behavior prediction, interaction analysis and system identification. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to model multi-agent systems, yielding improved performance over competitive baselines. We also show the model can successfully identify agent groups and interaction types in these systems. Our model offers new opportunities to predict complex multi-agent behaviors and takes a step forward in understanding interactions in multi-agent systems."
A Variational Perturbative Approach to Planning in Graph-Based Markov Decision Processes,"Coordinating multiple interacting agents to achieve a common goal is a difficult task with huge applicability. This problem remains hard to solve, even when limiting interactions to be mediated via a static interaction-graph. We present a novel approximate solution method for multi-agent Markov decision problems on graphs, based on variational perturbation theory. We adopt the strategy of planning via inference, which has been explored in various prior works. We employ a non-trivial extension of a novel high-order variational method that allows for approximate inference in large networks and has been shown to surpass the accuracy of existing variational methods. To compare our method to two state-of-the-art methods for multi-agent planning on graphs, we apply the method different standard GMDP problems. We show that in cases, where the goal is encoded as a non-local cost function, our method performs well, while state-of-the-art methods approach the performance of random guess. In a final experiment, we demonstrate that our method brings significant improvement for synchronization tasks."
Multi-Agent Game Abstraction via Graph Attention Neural Network,"In large-scale multi-agent systems, the large number of agents and complex game relationship cause great difficulty for policy learning. Therefore, simplifying the learning process is an important research issue. In many multi-agent systems, the interactions between agents often happen locally, which means that agents neither need to coordinate with all other agents nor need to coordinate with others all the time. Traditional methods attempt to use pre-defined rules to capture the interaction relationship between agents. However, the methods cannot be directly used in a large-scale environment due to the difficulty of transforming the complex interactions between agents into rules. In this paper, we model the relationship between agents by a complete graph and propose a novel game abstraction mechanism based on two-stage attention network (G2ANet), which can indicate whether there is an interaction between two agents and the importance of the interaction. We integrate this detection mechanism into graph neural network-based multi-agent reinforcement learning for conducting game abstraction and propose two novel learning algorithms GA-Comm and GA-AC. We conduct experiments in Traffic Junction and Predator-Prey. The results indicate that the proposed methods can simplify the learning process and meanwhile get better asymptotic performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."
Neighborhood Cognition Consistent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Social psychology and real experiences show that cognitive consistency plays an important role to keep human society in order: if people have a more consistent cognition about their environments, they are more likely to achieve better cooperation. Meanwhile, only cognitive consistency within a neighborhood matters because humans only interact directly with their neighbors. Inspired by these observations, we take the first step to introduce neighborhood cognitive consistency (NCC) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Our NCC design is quite general and can be easily combined with existing MARL methods. As examples, we propose neighborhood cognition consistent deep Q-learning and Actor-Critic to facilitate large-scale multi-agent cooperations. Extensive experiments on several challenging tasks (i.e., packet routing, wifi configuration and Google football player control) justify the superior performance of our methods compared with state-of-the-art MARL approaches."
Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Planning for Jointly Discovering and Tracking Mobile Objects,"We consider the challenging problem of online planning for a team of agents to autonomously search and track a time-varying number of mobile objects under the practical constraint of detection range limited onboard sensors. A standard POMDP with a value function that either encourages discovery or accurate tracking of mobile objects is inadequate to simultaneously meet the conflicting goals of searching for undiscovered mobile objects whilst keeping track of discovered objects. The planning problem is further complicated by misdetections or false detections of objects caused by range limited sensors and noise inherent to sensor measurements. We formulate a novel multi-objective POMDP based on information theoretic criteria, and an online multi-object tracking filter for the problem. Since controlling multi-agent is a well known combinatorial optimization problem, assigning control actions to agents necessitates a greedy algorithm. We prove that our proposed multi-objective value function is a monotone submodular set function; consequently, the greedy algorithm can achieve a (1-1/e) approximation for maximizing the submodular multi-objective function."
Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with Hierarchical Graph Attention Network,"Most previous studies on multi-agent reinforcement learning focus on deriving decentralized and cooperative policies to maximize a common reward and rarely consider the transferability of trained policies to new tasks. This prevents such policies from being applied to more complex multi-agent tasks. To resolve these limitations, we propose a model that conducts both representation learning for multiple agents using hierarchical graph attention network and policy learning using multi-agent actor-critic. The hierarchical graph attention network is specially designed to model the hierarchical relationships among multiple agents that either cooperate or compete with each other to derive more advanced strategic policies. Two attention networks, the inter-agent and inter-group attention layers, are used to effectively model individual and group level interactions, respectively. The two attention networks have been proven to facilitate the transfer of learned policies to new tasks with different agent compositions and allow one to interpret the learned strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods in several mixed cooperative and competitive tasks."
Clouseau: Generating Communication Protocols from Commitments,"Engineering a decentralized multiagent system (MAS) requires realizing interactions modeled as a communication protocol between autonomous agents. We contribute Clouseau, an approach that takes a commitment-based specification of an interaction and generates a communication protocol amenable to decentralized enactment. We show that the generated protocol is (1) correct—realizes all and only the computations that satisfy the input specification; (2) safe—ensures the agents' local views remain consistent; and (3) live—ensures the agents can proceed to completion."
Arena: A General Evaluation Platform and Building Toolkit for Multi-Agent Intelligence,"Learning agents that are not only capable of taking tests, but also innovating is becoming a hot topic in AI. One of the most promising paths towards this vision is multi-agent learning, where agents act as the environment for each other, and improving each agent means proposing new problems for others. However, existing evaluation platforms are either not compatible with multi-agent settings, or limited to a specific game. That is, there is not yet a general evaluation platform for research on multi-agent intelligence. To this end, we introduce Arena, a general evaluation platform for multi-agent intelligence with 35 games of diverse logics and representations. Furthermore, multi-agent intelligence is still at the stage where many problems remain unexplored. Therefore, we provide a building toolkit for researchers to easily invent and build novel multi-agent problems from the provided game set based on a GUI-configurable social tree and five basic multi-agent reward schemes. Finally, we provide Python implementations of five state-of-the-art deep multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines. Along with the baseline implementations, we release a set of 100 best agents/teams that we can train with different training schemes for each game, as the base for evaluating agents with population performance. As such, the research community can perform comparisons under a stable and uniform standard. All the implementations and accompanied tutorials have been open-sourced for the community at https://sites.google.com/view/arena-unity/."
Learning to Communicate Implicitly by Actions,"In situations where explicit communication is limited, human collaborators act by learning to: (i) infer meaning behind their partner's actions, and (ii) convey private information about the state to their partner implicitly through actions. The first component of this learning process has been well-studied in multi-agent systems, whereas the second — which is equally crucial for successful collaboration — has not. To mimic both components mentioned above, thereby completing the learning process, we introduce a novel algorithm: Policy Belief Learning (PBL). PBL uses a belief module to model the other agent's private information and a policy module to form a distribution over actions informed by the belief module. Furthermore, to encourage communication by actions, we propose a novel auxiliary reward which incentivizes one agent to help its partner to make correct inferences about its private information. The auxiliary reward for communication is integrated into the learning of the policy module. We evaluate our approach on a set of environments including a matrix game, particle environment and the non-competitive bidding problem from contract bridge. We show empirically that this auxiliary reward is effective and easy to generalize. These results demonstrate that our PBL algorithm can produce strong pairs of agents in collaborative games where explicit communication is disabled."
Fair Procedures for Fair Stable Marriage Outcomes,"Given a two-sided market where each agent ranks those on the other side by preference, the stable marriage problem calls for finding a perfect matching such that no pair of agents prefer each other to their matches. Recent studies show that the number of stable solutions can be large in practice. Yet the classical solution to the problem, the Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm, assigns an optimal match to each agent on one side, and a pessimal one to each on the other side; such a solution may fare well in terms of equity only in highly asymmetric markets. Finding a stable matching that minimizes the sex equality cost, an equity measure expressing the discrepancy of mean happiness among the two sides, is strongly NP-hard. Extant heuristics either (a) oblige some agents to involuntarily abandon their matches, or (b) bias the outcome in favor of some agents, or (c) need high-polynomial or unbounded time.We provide the first procedurally fair algorithms that output equitable stable marriages and are guaranteed to terminate in at most cubic time; the key to this breakthrough is the monitoring of a monotonic state function and the use of a selective criterion for accepting proposals. Our experiments with diverse simulated markets show that: (a) extant heuristics fail to yield high equity; (b) the best solution found by the GS algorithm can be very far from optimal equity; and (c) our procedures stand out in both efficiency and equity, even when compared to a non-procedurally fair approximation scheme."
Generalized and Sub-Optimal Bipartite Constraints for Conflict-Based Search,"The main idea of conflict-based search (CBS), a popular, state-of-the-art algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding is to resolve conflicts between agents by systematically adding constraints to agents. Recently, CBS has been adapted for new domains and variants, including non-unit costs and continuous time settings. These adaptations require new types of constraints. This paper introduces a new automatic constraint generation technique called bipartite reduction (BR). BR converts the constraint generation step of CBS to a surrogate bipartite graph problem. The properties of BR guarantee completeness and optimality for CBS. Also, BR's properties may be relaxed to obtain suboptimal solutions. Empirical results show that BR yields significant speedups in 2k connected grids over the previous state-of-the-art for both optimal and suboptimal search."
Shapley Q-Value: A Local Reward Approach to Solve Global Reward Games,"Cooperative game is a critical research area in the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Global reward game is a subclass of cooperative games, where all agents aim to maximize the global reward. Credit assignment is an important problem studied in the global reward game. Most of previous works stood by the view of non-cooperative-game theoretical framework with the shared reward approach, i.e., each agent being assigned a shared global reward directly. This, however, may give each agent an inaccurate reward on its contribution to the group, which could cause inefficient learning. To deal with this problem, we i) introduce a cooperative-game theoretical framework called extended convex game (ECG) that is a superset of global reward game, and ii) propose a local reward approach called Shapley Q-value. Shapley Q-value is able to distribute the global reward, reflecting each agent's own contribution in contrast to the shared reward approach. Moreover, we derive an MARL algorithm called Shapley Q-value deep deterministic policy gradient (SQDDPG), using Shapley Q-value as the critic for each agent. We evaluate SQDDPG on Cooperative Navigation, Prey-and-Predator and Traffic Junction, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, e.g., MADDPG, COMA, Independent DDPG and Independent A2C. In the experiments, SQDDPG shows a significant improvement on the convergence rate. Finally, we plot Shapley Q-value and validate the property of fair credit assignment."
From Few to More: Large-Scale Dynamic Multiagent Curriculum Learning,"A lot of efforts have been devoted to investigating how agents can learn effectively and achieve coordination in multiagent systems. However, it is still challenging in large-scale multiagent settings due to the complex dynamics between the environment and agents and the explosion of state-action space. In this paper, we design a novel Dynamic Multiagent Curriculum Learning (DyMA-CL) to solve large-scale problems by starting from learning on a multiagent scenario with a small size and progressively increasing the number of agents. We propose three transfer mechanisms across curricula to accelerate the learning process. Moreover, due to the fact that the state dimension varies across curricula, and existing network structures cannot be applied in such a transfer setting since their network input sizes are fixed. Therefore, we design a novel network structure called Dynamic Agent-number Network (DyAN) to handle the dynamic size of the network input. Experimental results show that DyMA-CL using DyAN greatly improves the performance of large-scale multiagent learning compared with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning approaches. We also investigate the influence of three transfer mechanisms across curricula through extensive simulations."
SMIX(λ): Enhancing Centralized Value Functions for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"This work presents a sample efficient and effective value-based method, named SMIX(λ), for reinforcement learning in multi-agent environments (MARL) within the paradigm of centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), in which learning a stable and generalizable centralized value function (CVF) is crucial. To achieve this, our method carefully combines different elements, including 1) removing the unrealistic centralized greedy assumption during the learning phase, 2) using the λ-return to balance the trade-off between bias and variance and to deal with the environment's non-Markovian property, and 3) adopting an experience-replay style off-policy training. Interestingly, it is revealed that there exists inherent connection between SMIX(λ) and previous off-policy Q(λ) approach for single-agent learning. Experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) benchmark show that the proposed SMIX(λ) algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art MARL methods by a large margin, and that it can be used as a general tool to improve the overall performance of a CTDE-type method by enhancing the evaluation quality of its CVF. We open-source our code at: https://github.com/chaovven/SMIX."
Optimal Common Contract with Heterogeneous Agents,"We consider the principal-agent problem with heterogeneous agents. Previous works assume that the principal signs independent incentive contracts with every agent to make them invest more efforts on the tasks. However, in many circumstances, these contracts need to be identical for the sake of fairness. We investigate the optimal common contract problem. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider this natural and important generalization. We first show this problem is NP-complete. Then we provide a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal contract in O(n2m) time, where n,m are the number of agents and actions, under the assumption that the agents' cost functions obey increasing difference property. At last, we generalize the setting such that each agent can choose to directly produce a reward in [0,1]. We provide an O(log n)-approximate algorithm for this generalization."
COBRA: Context-Aware Bernoulli Neural Networks for Reputation Assessment,"Trust and reputation management (TRM) plays an increasingly important role in large-scale online environments such as multi-agent systems (MAS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). One main objective of TRM is to achieve accurate trust assessment of entities such as agents or IoT service providers. However, this encounters an accuracy-privacy dilemma as we identify in this paper, and we propose a framework called Context-aware Bernoulli Neural Network based"
Bi-Level Actor-Critic for Multi-Agent Coordination,"Coordination is one of the essential problems in multi-agent systems. Typically multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods treat agents equally and the goal is to solve the Markov game to an arbitrary Nash equilibrium (NE) when multiple equilibra exist, thus lacking a solution for NE selection. In this paper, we treat agents unequally and consider Stackelberg equilibrium as a potentially better convergence point than Nash equilibrium in terms of Pareto superiority, especially in cooperative environments. Under Markov games, we formally define the bi-level reinforcement learning problem in finding Stackelberg equilibrium. We propose a novel bi-level actor-critic learning method that allows agents to have different knowledge base (thus intelligent), while their actions still can be executed simultaneously and distributedly. The convergence proof is given, while the resulting learning algorithm is tested against the state of the arts. We found that the proposed bi-level actor-critic algorithm successfully converged to the Stackelberg equilibria in matrix games and find a asymmetric solution in a highway merge environment."
Beyond Trees: Analysis and Convergence of Belief Propagation in Graphs with Multiple Cycles,"Belief propagation, an algorithm for solving problems represented by graphical models, has long been known to converge to the optimal solution when the graph is a tree. When the graph representing the problem includes a single cycle, the algorithm either converges to the optimal solution or performs periodic oscillations. While the conditions that trigger these two behaviors have been established, the question regarding the convergence and divergence of the algorithm on graphs that include more than one cycle is still open.Focusing on Max-sum, the version of belief propagation for solving distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs), we extend the theory on the behavior of belief propagation in general – and Max-sum specifically – when solving problems represented by graphs with multiple cycles. This includes: 1) Generalizing the results obtained for graphs with a single cycle to graphs with multiple cycles, by using backtrack cost trees (BCT). 2) Proving that when the algorithm is applied to adjacent symmetric cycles, the use of a large enough damping factor guarantees convergence to the optimal solution."
LeDeepChef Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Families of Text-Based Games,"While Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches lead to significant achievements in a variety of areas in recent history, natural language tasks remained mostly unaffected, due to the compositional and combinatorial nature that makes them notoriously hard to optimize. With the emerging field of Text-Based Games (TBGs), researchers try to bridge this gap. Inspired by the success of RL algorithms on Atari games, the idea is to develop new methods in a restricted game world and then gradually move to more complex environments. Previous work in the area of TBGs has mainly focused on solving individual games. We, however, consider the task of designing an agent that not just succeeds in a single game, but performs well across a whole family of games, sharing the same theme. In this work, we present our deep RL agent—LeDeepChef—that shows generalization capabilities to never-before-seen games of the same family with different environments and task descriptions. The agent participated in Microsoft Research's First TextWorld Problems: A Language and Reinforcement Learning Challenge and outperformed all but one competitor on the final test set. The games from the challenge all share the same theme, namely cooking in a modern house environment, but differ significantly in the arrangement of the rooms, the presented objects, and the specific goal (recipe to cook). To build an agent that achieves high scores across a whole family of games, we use an actor-critic framework and prune the action-space by using ideas from hierarchical reinforcement learning and a specialized module trained on a recipe database."
Knowledge Distillation from Internal Representations,"Knowledge distillation is typically conducted by training a small model (the student) to mimic a large and cumbersome model (the teacher). The idea is to compress the knowledge from the teacher by using its output probabilities as soft-labels to optimize the student. However, when the teacher is considerably large, there is no guarantee that the internal knowledge of the teacher will be transferred into the student; even if the student closely matches the soft-labels, its internal representations may be considerably different. This internal mismatch can undermine the generalization capabilities originally intended to be transferred from the teacher to the student. In this paper, we propose to distill the internal representations of a large model such as BERT into a simplified version of it. We formulate two ways to distill such representations and various algorithms to conduct the distillation. We experiment with datasets from the GLUE benchmark and consistently show that adding knowledge distillation from internal representations is a more powerful method than only using soft-label distillation."
Modelling Sentence Pairs via Reinforcement Learning: An Actor-Critic Approach to Learn the Irrelevant Words,"Learning sentence representation is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing. Most of the existing sentence pair modelling architectures focus only on extracting and using the rich sentence pair features. The drawback of utilizing all of these features makes the learning process much harder. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) method to learn a sentence pair representation when performing tasks like semantic similarity, paraphrase identification, and question-answer pair modelling. We formulate this learning problem as a sequential decision making task where the decision made in the current state will have a strong impact on the following decisions. We address this decision making with a policy gradient RL method which chooses the irrelevant words to delete by looking at the sub-optimal representation of the sentences being compared. With this policy, extensive experiments show that our model achieves on par performance when learning task-specific representations of sentence pairs without needing any further knowledge like parse trees. We suggest that the simplicity of each task inference provided by our RL model makes it easier to explain."
End-to-End Argumentation Knowledge Graph Construction,"This paper studies the end-to-end construction of an argumentation knowledge graph that is intended to support argument synthesis, argumentative question answering, or fake news detection, among others. The study is motivated by the proven effectiveness of knowledge graphs for interpretable and controllable text generation and exploratory search. Original in our work is that we propose a model of the knowledge encapsulated in arguments. Based on this model, we build a new corpus that comprises about 16k manual annotations of 4740 claims with instances of the model's elements, and we develop an end-to-end framework that automatically identifies all modeled types of instances. The results of experiments show the potential of the framework for building a web-based argumentation graph that is of high quality and large scale."
Story Realization: Expanding Plot Events into Sentences,"Neural network based approaches to automated story plot generation attempt to learn how to generate novel plots from a corpus of natural language plot summaries. Prior work has shown that a semantic abstraction of sentences called events improves neural plot generation and and allows one to decompose the problem into: (1) the generation of a sequence of events (event-to-event) and (2) the transformation of these events into natural language sentences (event-to-sentence). However, typical neural language generation approaches to event-to-sentence can ignore the event details and produce grammatically-correct but semantically-unrelated sentences. We present an ensemble-based model that generates natural language guided by events. We provide results—including a human subjects study—for a full end-to-end automated story generation system showing that our method generates more coherent and plausible stories than baseline approaches 1."
Do Not Have Enough Data? Deep Learning to the Rescue!,"Based on recent advances in natural language modeling and those in text generation capabilities, we propose a novel data augmentation method for text classification tasks. We use a powerful pre-trained neural network model to artificially synthesize new labeled data for supervised learning. We mainly focus on cases with scarce labeled data. Our method, referred to as language-model-based data augmentation (LAMBADA), involves fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language generator to a specific task through an initial training phase on the existing (usually small) labeled data. Using the fine-tuned model and given a class label, new sentences for the class are generated. Our process then filters these new sentences by using a classifier trained on the original data. In a series of experiments, we show that LAMBADA improves classifiers' performance on a variety of datasets. Moreover, LAMBADA significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art techniques for data augmentation, specifically those applicable to text classification tasks with little data."
Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing over Distantly Supervised Data Based on Refined Representations,"Fine-Grained Named Entity Typing (FG-NET) is a key component in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It aims at classifying an entity mention into a wide range of entity types. Due to a large number of entity types, distant supervision is used to collect training data for this task, which noisily assigns type labels to entity mentions irrespective of the context. In order to alleviate the noisy labels, existing approaches on FG-NET analyze the entity mentions entirely independent of each other and assign type labels solely based on mention's sentence-specific context. This is inadequate for highly overlapping and/or noisy type labels as it hinders information passing across sentence boundaries. For this, we propose an edge-weighted attentive graph convolution network that refines the noisy mention representations by attending over corpus-level contextual clues prior to the end classification. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing research by a relative score of upto 10.2% and 8.3% for macro-f1 and micro-f1 respectively."
Understanding the Semantic Content of Sparse Word Embeddings Using a Commonsense Knowledge Base,"Word embeddings have developed into a major NLP tool with broad applicability. Understanding the semantic content of word embeddings remains an important challenge for additional applications. One aspect of this issue is to explore the interpretability of word embeddings. Sparse word embeddings have been proposed as models with improved interpretability. Continuing this line of research, we investigate the extent to which human interpretable semantic concepts emerge along the bases of sparse word representations. In order to have a broad framework for evaluation, we consider three general approaches for constructing sparse word representations, which are then evaluated in multiple ways. We propose a novel methodology to evaluate the semantic content of word embeddings using a commonsense knowledge base, applied here to the sparse case. This methodology is illustrated by two techniques using the ConceptNet knowledge base. The first approach assigns a commonsense concept label to the individual dimensions of the embedding space. The second approach uses a metric, derived by spreading activation, to quantify the coherence of coordinates along the individual axes. We also provide results on the relationship between the two approaches. The results show, for example, that in the individual dimensions of sparse word embeddings, words having high coefficients are more semantically related in terms of path lengths in the knowledge base than the ones having zero coefficients."
Simultaneously Linking Entities and Extracting Relations from Biomedical Text without Mention-Level Supervision,"Understanding the meaning of text often involves reasoning about entities and their relationships. This requires identifying textual mentions of entities, linking them to a canonical concept, and discerning their relationships. These tasks are nearly always viewed as separate components within a pipeline, each requiring a distinct model and training data. While relation extraction can often be trained with readily available weak or distant supervision, entity linkers typically require expensive mention-level supervision – which is not available in many domains. Instead, we propose a model which is trained to simultaneously produce entity linking and relation decisions while requiring no mention-level annotations. This approach avoids cascading errors that arise from pipelined methods and more accurately predicts entity relationships from text. We show that our model outperforms a state-of-the art entity linking and relation extraction pipeline on two biomedical datasets and can drastically improve the overall recall of the system."
Zero-Resource Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition,"Recently, neural methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for many languages without the need for manually crafted features. However, these models still require manually annotated training data, which is not available for many languages. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cross-lingual NER model that can transfer NER knowledge from one language to another in a completely unsupervised way without relying on any bilingual dictionary or parallel data. Our model achieves this through word-level adversarial learning and augmented fine-tuning with parameter sharing and feature augmentation. Experiments on five different languages demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing models by a good margin and setting a new SOTA for each language pair."
Generating Well-Formed Answers by Machine Reading with Stochastic Selector Networks,"Question answering (QA) based on machine reading comprehension has been a recent surge in popularity, yet most work has focused on extractive methods. We instead address a more challenging QA problem of generating a well-formed answer by reading and summarizing the paragraph for a given question.For the generative QA task, we introduce a new neural architecture, LatentQA, in which a novel stochastic selector network composes a well-formed answer with words selected from the question, the paragraph and the global vocabulary, based on a sequence of discrete latent variables. Bayesian inference for the latent variables is performed to train the LatentQA model. The experiments on public datasets of natural answer generation confirm the effectiveness of LatentQA in generating high-quality well-formed answers."
PIQA: Reasoning about Physical Commonsense in Natural Language,"To apply eyeshadow without a brush, should I use a cotton swab or a toothpick? Questions requiring this kind of physical commonsense pose a challenge to today's natural language understanding systems. While recent pretrained models (such as BERT) have made progress on question answering over more abstract domains – such as news articles and encyclopedia entries, where text is plentiful – in more physical domains, text is inherently limited due to reporting bias. Can AI systems learn to reliably answer physical commonsense questions without experiencing the physical world?In this paper, we introduce the task of physical commonsense reasoning and a corresponding benchmark dataset Physical Interaction: Question Answering or PIQA. Though humans find the dataset easy (95% accuracy), large pretrained models struggle (∼75%). We provide analysis about the dimensions of knowledge that existing models lack, which offers significant opportunities for future research."
Back to the Future – Temporal Adaptation of Text Representations,"Language evolves over time in many ways relevant to natural language processing tasks. For example, recent occurrences of tokens 'BERT' and 'ELMO' in publications refer to neural network architectures rather than persons. This type of temporal signal is typically overlooked, but is important if one aims to deploy a machine learning model over an extended period of time. In particular, language evolution causes data drift between time-steps in sequential decision-making tasks. Examples of such tasks include prediction of paper acceptance for yearly conferences (regular intervals) or author stance prediction for rumours on Twitter (irregular intervals). Inspired by successes in computer vision, we tackle data drift by sequentially aligning learned representations. We evaluate on three challenging tasks varying in terms of time-scales, linguistic units, and domains. These tasks show our method outperforming several strong baselines, including using all available data. We argue that, due to its low computational expense, sequential alignment is a practical solution to dealing with language evolution."
Modelling Semantic Categories Using Conceptual Neighborhood,"While many methods for learning vector space embeddings have been proposed in the field of Natural Language Processing, these methods typically do not distinguish between categories and individuals. Intuitively, if individuals are represented as vectors, we can think of categories as (soft) regions in the embedding space. Unfortunately, meaningful regions can be difficult to estimate, especially since we often have few examples of individuals that belong to a given category. To address this issue, we rely on the fact that different categories are often highly interdependent. In particular, categories often have conceptual neighbors, which are disjoint from but closely related to the given category (e.g. fruit and vegetable). Our hypothesis is that more accurate category representations can be learned by relying on the assumption that the regions representing such conceptual neighbors should be adjacent in the embedding space. We propose a simple method for identifying conceptual neighbors and then show that incorporating these conceptual neighbors indeed leads to more accurate region based representations."
Inducing Relational Knowledge from BERT,"One of the most remarkable properties of word embeddings is the fact that they capture certain types of semantic and syntactic relationships. Recently, pre-trained language models such as BERT have achieved groundbreaking results across a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, it is unclear to what extent such models capture relational knowledge beyond what is already captured by standard word embeddings. To explore this question, we propose a methodology for distilling relational knowledge from a pre-trained language model. Starting from a few seed instances of a given relation, we first use a large text corpus to find sentences that are likely to express this relation. We then use a subset of these extracted sentences as templates. Finally, we fine-tune a language model to predict whether a given word pair is likely to be an instance of some relation, when given an instantiated template for that relation as input."
Graph Transformer for Graph-to-Sequence Learning,"The dominant graph-to-sequence transduction models employ graph neural networks for graph representation learning, where the structural information is reflected by the receptive field of neurons. Unlike graph neural networks that restrict the information exchange between immediate neighborhood, we propose a new model, known as Graph Transformer, that uses explicit relation encoding and allows direct communication between two distant nodes. It provides a more efficient way for global graph structure modeling. Experiments on the applications of text generation from Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and syntax-based neural machine translation show the superiority of our proposed model. Specifically, our model achieves 27.4 BLEU on LDC2015E86 and 29.7 BLEU on LDC2017T10 for AMR-to-text generation, outperforming the state-of-the-art results by up to 2.2 points. On the syntax-based translation tasks, our model establishes new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU scores, 21.3 for English-to-German and 14.1 for English-to-Czech, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 1 BLEU."
Learning from Easy to Complex: Adaptive Multi-Curricula Learning for Neural Dialogue Generation,"Current state-of-the-art neural dialogue systems are mainly data-driven and are trained on human-generated responses. However, due to the subjectivity and open-ended nature of human conversations, the complexity of training dialogues varies greatly. The noise and uneven complexity of query-response pairs impede the learning efficiency and effects of the neural dialogue generation models. What is more, so far, there are no unified dialogue complexity measurements, and the dialogue complexity embodies multiple aspects of attributes—specificity, repetitiveness, relevance, etc. Inspired by human behaviors of learning to converse, where children learn from easy dialogues to complex ones and dynamically adjust their learning progress, in this paper, we first analyze five dialogue attributes to measure the dialogue complexity in multiple perspectives on three publicly available corpora. Then, we propose an adaptive multi-curricula learning framework to schedule a committee of the organized curricula. The framework is established upon the reinforcement learning paradigm, which automatically chooses different curricula at the evolving learning process according to the learning status of the neural dialogue generation model. Extensive experiments conducted on five state-of-the-art models demonstrate its learning efficiency and effectiveness with respect to 13 automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Reading Comprehension,"Reading comprehension (RC) has been studied in a variety of datasets with the boosted performance brought by deep neural networks. However, the generalization capability of these models across different domains remains unclear. To alleviate the problem, we investigate unsupervised domain adaptation on RC, wherein a model is trained on the labeled source domain and to be applied to the target domain with only unlabeled samples. We first show that even with the powerful BERT contextual representation, a model can not generalize well from one domain to another. To solve this, we provide a novel conditional adversarial self-training method (CASe). Specifically, our approach leverages a BERT model fine-tuned on the source dataset along with the confidence filtering to generate reliable pseudo-labeled samples in the target domain for self-training. On the other hand, it further reduces domain distribution discrepancy through conditional adversarial learning across domains. Extensive experiments show our approach achieves comparable performance to supervised models on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets."
Zero-Shot Text-to-SQL Learning with Auxiliary Task,"Recent years have seen great success in the use of neural seq2seq models on the text-to-SQL task. However, little work has paid attention to how these models generalize to realistic unseen data, which naturally raises a question: does this impressive performance signify a perfect generalization model, or are there still some limitations?In this paper, we first diagnose the bottleneck of the text-to-SQL task by providing a new testbed, in which we observe that existing models present poor generalization ability on rarely-seen data. The above analysis encourages us to design a simple but effective auxiliary task, which serves as a supportive model as well as a regularization term to the generation task to increase the models' generalization. Experimentally, We evaluate our models on a large text-to-SQL dataset WikiSQL. Compared to a strong baseline coarse-to-fine model, our models improve over the baseline by more than 3% absolute in accuracy on the whole dataset. More interestingly, on a zero-shot subset test of WikiSQL, our models achieve 5% absolute accuracy gain over the baseline, clearly demonstrating its superior generalizability."
Hyperbolic Interaction Model for Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification,"Different from the traditional classification tasks which assume mutual exclusion of labels, hierarchical multi-label classification (HMLC) aims to assign multiple labels to every instance with the labels organized under hierarchical relations. Besides the labels, since linguistic ontologies are intrinsic hierarchies, the conceptual relations between words can also form hierarchical structures. Thus it can be a challenge to learn mappings from word hierarchies to label hierarchies. We propose to model the word and label hierarchies by embedding them jointly in the hyperbolic space. The main reason is that the tree-likeness of the hyperbolic space matches the complexity of symbolic data with hierarchical structures. A new Hyperbolic Interaction Model (HyperIM) is designed to learn the label-aware document representations and make predictions for HMLC. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results have demonstrated that the new model can realistically capture the complex data structures and further improve the performance for HMLC comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. To facilitate future research, our code is publicly available."
DMRM: A Dual-Channel Multi-Hop Reasoning Model for Visual Dialog,"Visual Dialog is a vision-language task that requires an AI agent to engage in a conversation with humans grounded in an image. It remains a challenging task since it requires the agent to fully understand a given question before making an appropriate response not only from the textual dialog history, but also from the visually-grounded information. While previous models typically leverage single-hop reasoning or single-channel reasoning to deal with this complex multimodal reasoning task, which is intuitively insufficient. In this paper, we thus propose a novel and more powerful Dual-channel Multi-hop Reasoning Model for Visual Dialog, named DMRM. DMRM synchronously captures information from the dialog history and the image to enrich the semantic representation of the question by exploiting dual-channel reasoning. Specifically, DMRM maintains a dual channel to obtain the question- and history-aware image features and the question- and image-aware dialog history features by a mulit-hop reasoning process in each channel. Additionally, we also design an effective multimodal attention to further enhance the decoder to generate more accurate responses. Experimental results on the VisDial v0.9 and v1.0 datasets demonstrate that the proposed model is effective and outperforms compared models by a significant margin."
Sequence Generation with Optimal-Transport-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used to aid training in language generation. This is achieved by enhancing standard maximum likelihood objectives with user-specified reward functions that encourage global semantic consistency. We propose a principled approach to address the difficulties associated with RL-based solutions, namely, high-variance gradients, uninformative rewards and brittle training. By leveraging the optimal transport distance, we introduce a regularizer that significantly alleviates the above issues. Our formulation emphasizes the preservation of semantic features, enabling end-to-end training instead of ad-hoc fine-tuning, and when combined with RL, it controls the exploration space for more efficient model updates. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we perform a comprehensive evaluation covering a wide variety of NLP tasks: machine translation, abstractive text summarization and image caption, with consistent improvements over competing solutions."
Schema-Guided Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking with Graph Attention Neural Networks,"Dialogue state tracking (DST) aims at estimating the current dialogue state given all the preceding conversation. For multi-domain DST, the data sparsity problem is also a major obstacle due to the increased number of state candidates. Existing approaches generally predict the value for each slot independently and do not consider slot relations, which may aggravate the data sparsity problem. In this paper, we propose a Schema-guided multi-domain dialogue State Tracker with graph attention networks (SST) that predicts dialogue states from dialogue utterances and schema graphs which contain slot relations in edges. We also introduce a graph attention matching network to fuse information from utterances and graphs, and a recurrent graph attention network to control state updating. Experiment results show that our approach obtains new state-of-the-art performance on both MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 benchmarks."
Improving Entity Linking by Modeling Latent Entity Type Information,"Existing state of the art neural entity linking models employ attention-based bag-of-words context model and pre-trained entity embeddings bootstrapped from word embeddings to assess topic level context compatibility. However, the latent entity type information in the immediate context of the mention is neglected, which causes the models often link mentions to incorrect entities with incorrect type. To tackle this problem, we propose to inject latent entity type information into the entity embeddings based on pre-trained BERT. In addition, we integrate a BERT-based entity similarity score into the local context model of a state-of-the-art model to better capture latent entity type information. Our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art entity linking models on standard benchmark (AIDA-CoNLL). Detailed experiment analysis demonstrates that our model corrects most of the type errors produced by the direct baseline."
TemPEST: Soft Template-Based Personalized EDM Subject Generation through Collaborative Summarization,"We address personalized Electronic Direct Mail (EDM) subject generation, which generates an attractive subject line for a product description according to user's preference on different contents or writing styles. Generating personalized EDM subjects has a few notable differences from generating text summaries. The subject has to be not only faithful to the description itself but also attractive to increase the click-through rate. Moreover, different users may have different preferences over the styles of topics. We propose a novel personalized EDM subject generation model named Soft Template-based Personalized EDM Subject Generator (TemPEST) to consider the aforementioned users' characteristics when generating subjects, which contains a soft template-based selective encoder network, a user rating encoder network, a summary decoder network and a rating decoder. Experimental results indicate that TemPEST is able to generate personalized topics and also effectively perform recommending rating reconstruction."
Learning to Map Frequent Phrases to Sub-Structures of Meaning Representation for Neural Semantic Parsing,"Neural semantic parsers usually generate meaning representation tokens from natural language tokens via an encoder-decoder model. However, there is often a vocabulary-mismatch problem between natural language utterances and logical forms. That is, one word maps to several atomic logical tokens, which need to be handled as a whole, rather than individual logical tokens at multiple steps. In this paper, we propose that the vocabulary-mismatch problem can be effectively resolved by leveraging appropriate logical tokens. Specifically, we exploit macro actions, which are of the same granularity of words/phrases, and allow the model to learn mappings from frequent phrases to corresponding sub-structures of meaning representation. Furthermore, macro actions are compact, and therefore utilizing them can significantly reduce the search space, which brings a great benefit to weakly supervised semantic parsing. Experiments show that our method leads to substantial performance improvement on three benchmarks, in both supervised and weakly supervised settings."
Attending to Entities for Better Text Understanding,"Recent progress in NLP witnessed the development of large-scale pre-trained language models (GPT, BERT, XLNet, etc.) based on Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017), and in a range of end tasks, such models have achieved state-of-the-art results, approaching human performance. This clearly demonstrates the power of the stacked self-attention architecture when paired with a sufficient number of layers and a large amount of pre-training data. However, on tasks that require complex and long-distance reasoning where surface-level cues are not enough, there is still a large gap between the pre-trained models and human performance. Strubell et al. (2018) recently showed that it is possible to inject knowledge of syntactic structure into a model through supervised self-attention. We conjecture that a similar injection of semantic knowledge, in particular, coreference information, into an existing model would improve performance on such complex problems. On the LAMBADA (Paperno et al. 2016) task, we show that a model trained from scratch with coreference as auxiliary supervision for self-attention outperforms the largest GPT-2 model, setting the new state-of-the-art, while only containing a tiny fraction of parameters compared to GPT-2. We also conduct a thorough analysis of different variants of model architectures and supervision configurations, suggesting future directions on applying similar techniques to other problems."
Dynamic Embedding on Textual Networks via a Gaussian Process,"Textual network embedding aims to learn low-dimensional representations of text-annotated nodes in a graph. Prior work in this area has typically focused on fixed graph structures; however, real-world networks are often dynamic. We address this challenge with a novel end-to-end node-embedding model, called Dynamic Embedding for Textual Networks with a Gaussian Process (DetGP). After training, DetGP can be applied efficiently to dynamic graphs without re-training or backpropagation. The learned representation of each node is a combination of textual and structural embeddings. Because the structure is allowed to be dynamic, our method uses the Gaussian process to take advantage of its non-parametric properties. To use both local and global graph structures, diffusion is used to model multiple hops between neighbors. The relative importance of global versus local structure for the embeddings is learned automatically. With the non-parametric nature of the Gaussian process, updating the embeddings for a changed graph structure requires only a forward pass through the learned model. Considering link prediction and node classification, experiments demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our method compared to baseline approaches. We further show that DetGP can be straightforwardly and efficiently applied to dynamic textual networks."
Cross-Lingual Natural Language Generation via Pre-Training,"In this work we focus on transferring supervision signals of natural language generation (NLG) tasks between multiple languages. We propose to pretrain the encoder and the decoder of a sequence-to-sequence model under both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. The pre-training objective encourages the model to represent different languages in the shared space, so that we can conduct zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. After the pre-training procedure, we use monolingual data to fine-tune the pre-trained model on downstream NLG tasks. Then the sequence-to-sequence model trained in a single language can be directly evaluated beyond that language (i.e., accepting multi-lingual input and producing multi-lingual output). Experimental results on question generation and abstractive summarization show that our model outperforms the machine-translation-based pipeline methods for zero-shot cross-lingual generation. Moreover, cross-lingual transfer improves NLG performance of low-resource languages by leveraging rich-resource language data. Our implementation and data are available at https://github.com/CZWin32768/xnlg."
An Empirical Study of Content Understanding in Conversational Question Answering,"With a lot of work about context-free question answering systems, there is an emerging trend of conversational question answering models in the natural language processing field. Thanks to the recently collected datasets, including QuAC and CoQA, there has been more work on conversational question answering, and recent work has achieved competitive performance on both datasets. However, to best of our knowledge, two important questions for conversational comprehension research have not been well studied: 1) How well can the benchmark dataset reflect models' content understanding? 2) Do the models well utilize the conversation content when answering questions? To investigate these questions, we design different training settings, testing settings, as well as an attack to verify the models' capability of content understanding on QuAC and CoQA. The experimental results indicate some potential hazards in the benchmark datasets, QuAC and CoQA, for conversational comprehension research. Our analysis also sheds light on both what models may learn and how datasets may bias the models. With deep investigation of the task, it is believed that this work can benefit the future progress of conversation comprehension. The source code is available at https://github.com/MiuLab/CQA-Study."
How to Ask Better Questions? A Large-Scale Multi-Domain Dataset for Rewriting Ill-Formed Questions,"We present a large-scale dataset for the task of rewriting an ill-formed natural language question to a well-formed one. Our multi-domain question rewriting (MQR) dataset is constructed from human contributed Stack Exchange question edit histories. The dataset contains 427,719 question pairs which come from 303 domains. We provide human annotations for a subset of the dataset as a quality estimate. When moving from ill-formed to well-formed questions, the question quality improves by an average of 45 points across three aspects. We train sequence-to-sequence neural models on the constructed dataset and obtain an improvement of 13.2% in BLEU-4 over baseline methods built from other data resources. We release the MQR dataset to encourage research on the problem of question rewriting.1"
Guiding Attention in Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Dialogue Act Prediction,"The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality. Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to the state of the art our model does not require handcrafted features and is trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on MRDA."
Discriminative Sentence Modeling for Story Ending Prediction,"Story Ending Prediction is a task that needs to select an appropriate ending for the given story, which requires the machine to understand the story and sometimes needs commonsense knowledge. To tackle this task, we propose a new neural network called Diff-Net for better modeling the differences of each ending in this task. The proposed model could discriminate two endings in three semantic levels: contextual representation, story-aware representation, and discriminative representation. Experimental results on the Story Cloze Test dataset show that the proposed model siginificantly outperforms various systems by a large margin, and detailed ablation studies are given for better understanding our model. We also carefully examine the traditional and BERT-based models on both SCT v1.0 and v1.5 with interesting findings that may potentially help future studies."
Multiple Positional Self-Attention Network for Text Classification,"Self-attention mechanisms have recently caused many concerns on Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Relative positional information is important to self-attention mechanisms. We propose Faraway Mask focusing on the (2m + 1)-gram words and Scaled-Distance Mask putting the logarithmic distance punishment to avoid and weaken the self-attention of distant words respectively. To exploit different masks, we present Positional Self-Attention Layer for generating different Masked-Self-Attentions and a following Position-Fusion Layer in which fused positional information multiplies the Masked-Self-Attentions for generating sentence embeddings. To evaluate our sentence embeddings approach Multiple Positional Self-Attention Network (MPSAN), we perform the comparison experiments on sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness and sentence classification tasks. The result shows that our MPSAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five datasets and the test accuracy is improved by 0.81%, 0.6% on SST, CR datasets, respectively. In addition, we reduce training parameters and improve the time efficiency of MPSAN by lowering the dimension number of self-attention and simplifying fusion mechanism."
Adversarial Training Based Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Sentiment Analysis,"Multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MS-UDA) for sentiment analysis (SA) aims to leverage useful information in multiple source domains to help do SA in an unlabeled target domain that has no supervised information. Existing algorithms of MS-UDA either only exploit the shared features, i.e., the domain-invariant information, or based on some weak assumption in NLP, e.g., smoothness assumption. To avoid these problems, we propose two transfer learning frameworks based on the multi-source domain adaptation methodology for SA by combining the source hypotheses to derive a good target hypothesis. The key feature of the first framework is a novel Weighting Scheme based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation framework ((WS-UDA), which combine the source classifiers to acquire pseudo labels for target instances directly. While the second framework is a Two-Stage Training based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation framework (2ST-UDA), which further exploits these pseudo labels to train a target private extractor. Importantly, the weights assigned to each source classifier are based on the relations between target instances and source domains, which measured by a discriminator through the adversarial training. Furthermore, through the same discriminator, we also fulfill the separation of shared features and private features.Experimental results on two SA datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our frameworks, which outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art competitors."
Hypernym Detection Using Strict Partial Order Networks,"This paper introduces Strict Partial Order Networks (SPON), a novel neural network architecture designed to enforce asymmetry and transitive properties as soft constraints. We apply it to induce hypernymy relations by training with is-a pairs. We also present an augmented variant of SPON that can generalize type information learned for in-vocabulary terms to previously unseen ones. An extensive evaluation over eleven benchmarks across different tasks shows that SPON consistently either outperforms or attains the state of the art on all but one of these benchmarks."
Just Add Functions: A Neural-Symbolic Language Model,"Neural network language models (NNLMs) have achieved ever-improving accuracy due to more sophisticated architectures and increasing amounts of training data. However, the inductive bias of these models (formed by the distributional hypothesis of language), while ideally suited to modeling most running text, results in key limitations for today's models. In particular, the models often struggle to learn certain spatial, temporal, or quantitative relationships, which are commonplace in text and are second-nature for human readers. Yet, in many cases, these relationships can be encoded with simple mathematical or logical expressions. How can we augment today's neural models with such encodings?In this paper, we propose a general methodology to enhance the inductive bias of NNLMs by incorporating simple functions into a neural architecture to form a hierarchical neural-symbolic language model (NSLM). These functions explicitly encode symbolic deterministic relationships to form probability distributions over words. We explore the effectiveness of this approach on numbers and geographic locations, and show that NSLMs significantly reduce perplexity in small-corpus language modeling, and that the performance improvement persists for rare tokens even on much larger corpora. The approach is simple and general, and we discuss how it can be applied to other word classes beyond numbers and geography."
An Iterative Polishing Framework Based on Quality Aware Masked Language Model for Chinese Poetry Generation,"Owing to its unique literal and aesthetical characteristics, automatic generation of Chinese poetry is still challenging in Artificial Intelligence, which can hardly be straightforwardly realized by end-to-end methods. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative polishing framework for highly qualified Chinese poetry generation. In the first stage, an encoder-decoder structure is utilized to generate a poem draft. Afterwards, our proposed Quality-Aware Masked Language Model (QA-MLM) is employed to polish the draft towards higher quality in terms of linguistics and literalness. Based on a multi-task learning scheme, QA-MLM is able to determine whether polishing is needed based on the poem draft. Furthermore, QA-MLM is able to localize improper characters of the poem draft and substitute with newly predicted ones accordingly. Benefited from the masked language model structure, QA-MLM incorporates global context information into the polishing process, which can obtain more appropriate polishing results than the unidirectional sequential decoding. Moreover, the iterative polishing process will be terminated automatically when QA-MLM regards the processed poem as a qualified one. Both human and automatic evaluation have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that our approach is effective to improve the performance of encoder-decoder structure."
Joint Learning of Answer Selection and Answer Summary Generation in Community Question Answering,"Community question answering (CQA) gains increasing popularity in both academy and industry recently. However, the redundancy and lengthiness issues of crowdsourced answers limit the performance of answer selection and lead to reading difficulties and misunderstandings for community users. To solve these problems, we tackle the tasks of answer selection and answer summary generation in CQA with a novel joint learning model. Specifically, we design a question-driven pointer-generator network, which exploits the correlation information between question-answer pairs to aid in attending the essential information when generating answer summaries. Meanwhile, we leverage the answer summaries to alleviate noise in original lengthy answers when ranking the relevancy degrees of question-answer pairs. In addition, we construct a new large-scale CQA corpus, WikiHowQA, which contains long answers for answer selection as well as reference summaries for answer summarization. The experimental results show that the joint learning method can effectively address the answer redundancy issue in CQA and achieves state-of-the-art results on both answer selection and text summarization tasks. Furthermore, the proposed model is shown to be of great transferring ability and applicability for resource-poor CQA tasks, which lack of reference answer summaries."
On Measuring and Mitigating Biased Inferences of Word Embeddings,"Word embeddings carry stereotypical connotations from the text they are trained on, which can lead to invalid inferences in downstream models that rely on them. We use this observation to design a mechanism for measuring stereotypes using the task of natural language inference. We demonstrate a reduction in invalid inferences via bias mitigation strategies on static word embeddings (GloVe). Further, we show that for gender bias, these techniques extend to contextualized embeddings when applied selectively only to the static components of contextualized embeddings (ELMo, BERT)."
Asymmetrical Hierarchical Networks with Attentive Interactions for Interpretable Review-Based Recommendation,"Recently, recommender systems have been able to emit substantially improved recommendations by leveraging user-provided reviews. Existing methods typically merge all reviews of a given user (item) into a long document, and then process user and item documents in the same manner. In practice, however, these two sets of reviews are notably different: users' reviews reflect a variety of items that they have bought and are hence very heterogeneous in their topics, while an item's reviews pertain only to that single item and are thus topically homogeneous. In this work, we develop a novel neural network model that properly accounts for this important difference by means of asymmetric attentive modules. The user module learns to attend to only those signals that are relevant with respect to the target item, whereas the item module learns to extract the most salient contents with regard to properties of the item. Our multi-hierarchical paradigm accounts for the fact that neither are all reviews equally useful, nor are all sentences within each review equally pertinent. Extensive experimental results on a variety of real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Detecting Asks in Social Engineering Attacks: Impact of Linguistic and Structural Knowledge,"Social engineers attempt to manipulate users into undertaking actions such as downloading malware by clicking links or providing access to money or sensitive information. Natural language processing, computational sociolinguistics, and media-specific structural clues provide a means for detecting both the ask (e.g., buy gift card) and the risk/reward implied by the ask, which we call framing (e.g., lose your job, get a raise). We apply linguistic resources such as Lexical Conceptual Structure to tackle ask detection and also leverage structural clues such as links and their proximity to identified asks to improve confidence in our results. Our experiments indicate that the performance of ask detection, framing detection, and identification of the top ask is improved by linguistically motivated classes coupled with structural clues such as links. Our approach is implemented in a system that informs users about social engineering risk situations."
Corpus Wide Argument Mining—A Working Solution,"One of the main tasks in argument mining is the retrieval of argumentative content pertaining to a given topic. Most previous work addressed this task by retrieving a relatively small number of relevant documents as the initial source for such content. This line of research yielded moderate success, which is of limited use in a real-world system. Furthermore, for such a system to yield a comprehensive set of relevant arguments, over a wide range of topics, it requires leveraging a large and diverse corpus in an appropriate manner. Here we present a first end-to-end high-precision, corpus-wide argument mining system. This is made possible by combining sentence-level queries over an appropriate indexing of a very large corpus of newspaper articles, with an iterative annotation scheme. This scheme addresses the inherent label bias in the data and pinpoints the regions of the sample space whose manual labeling is required to obtain high-precision among top-ranked candidates."
Latent Emotion Memory for Multi-Label Emotion Classification,"Identifying multiple emotions in a sentence is an important research topic. Existing methods usually model the problem as multi-label classification task. However, previous methods have two issues, limiting the performance of the task. First, these models do not consider prior emotion distribution in a sentence. Second, they fail to effectively capture the context information closely related to the corresponding emotion. In this paper, we propose a Latent Emotion Memory network (LEM) for multi-label emotion classification. The proposed model can learn the latent emotion distribution without external knowledge, and can effectively leverage it into the classification network. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms strong baselines, achieving the state-of-the-art performance."
Translucent Answer Predictions in Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension,"Research on the task of Reading Comprehension style Question Answering (RCQA) has gained momentum in recent years due to the emergence of human annotated datasets and associated leaderboards, for example CoQA, HotpotQA, SQuAD, TriviaQA, etc. While state-of-the-art has advanced considerably, there is still ample opportunity to advance it further on some important variants of the RCQA task. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural architecture, called TAP (Translucent Answer Prediction), to identify answers and evidence (in the form of supporting facts) in an RCQA task requiring multi-hop reasoning. TAP comprises two loosely coupled networks – Local and Global Interaction eXtractor (LoGIX) and Answer Predictor (AP). LoGIX predicts supporting facts, whereas AP consumes these predicted supporting facts to predict the answer span. The novel design of LoGIX is inspired by two key design desiderata – local context and global interaction– that we identified by analyzing examples of multi-hop RCQA task. The loose coupling between LoGIX and the AP reveals the set of sentences used by the AP in predicting an answer. Therefore, answer predictions of TAP can be interpreted in a translucent manner. TAP offers state-of-the-art performance on the HotpotQA (Yang et al. 2018) dataset – an apt dataset for multi-hop RCQA task – as it occupies Rank-1 on its leaderboard (https://hotpotqa.github.io/) at the time of submission."
Posterior-GAN: Towards Informative and Coherent Response Generation with Posterior Generative Adversarial Network,"Neural conversational models learn to generate responses by taking into account the dialog history. These models are typically optimized over the query-response pairs with a maximum likelihood estimation objective. However, the query-response tuples are naturally loosely coupled, and there exist multiple responses that can respond to a given query, which leads the conversational model learning burdensome. Besides, the general dull response problem is even worsened when the model is confronted with meaningless response training instances. Intuitively, a high-quality response not only responds to the given query but also links up to the future conversations, in this paper, we leverage the query-response-future turn triples to induce the generated responses that consider both the given context and the future conversations. To facilitate the modeling of these triples, we further propose a novel encoder-decoder based generative adversarial learning framework, Posterior Generative Adversarial Network (Posterior-GAN), which consists of a forward and a backward generative discriminator to cooperatively encourage the generated response to be informative and coherent by two complementary assessment perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively boosts the informativeness and coherence of the generated response on both automatic and human evaluation, which verifies the advantages of considering two assessment perspectives."
Learning to Select Bi-Aspect Information for Document-Scale Text Content Manipulation,"In this paper, we focus on a new practical task, document-scale text content manipulation, which is the opposite of text style transfer and aims to preserve text styles while altering the content. In detail, the input is a set of structured records and a reference text for describing another recordset. The output is a summary that accurately describes the partial content in the source recordset with the same writing style of the reference. The task is unsupervised due to lack of parallel data, and is challenging to select suitable records and style words from bi-aspect inputs respectively and generate a high-fidelity long document. To tackle those problems, we first build a dataset based on a basketball game report corpus as our testbed, and present an unsupervised neural model with interactive attention mechanism, which is used for learning the semantic relationship between records and reference texts to achieve better content transfer and better style preservation. In addition, we also explore the effectiveness of the back-translation in our task for constructing some pseudo-training pairs. Empirical results show superiority of our approaches over competitive methods, and the models also yield a new state-of-the-art result on a sentence-level dataset. 1"
Discontinuous Constituent Parsing with Pointer Networks,"One of the most complex syntactic representations used in computational linguistics and NLP are discontinuous constituent trees, crucial for representing all grammatical phenomena of languages such as German. Recent advances in dependency parsing have shown that Pointer Networks excel in efficiently parsing syntactic relations between words in a sentence. This kind of sequence-to-sequence models achieve outstanding accuracies in building non-projective dependency trees, but its potential has not been proved yet on a more difficult task. We propose a novel neural network architecture that, by means of Pointer Networks, is able to generate the most accurate discontinuous constituent representations to date, even without the need of Part-of-Speech tagging information. To do so, we internally model discontinuous constituent structures as augmented non-projective dependency structures. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the two widely-used NEGRA and TIGER benchmarks, outperforming previous work by a wide margin."
Rethinking Generalization of Neural Models: A Named Entity Recognition Case Study,"While neural network-based models have achieved impressive performance on a large body of NLP tasks, the generalization behavior of different models remains poorly understood: Does this excellent performance imply a perfect generalization model, or are there still some limitations? In this paper, we take the NER task as a testbed to analyze the generalization behavior of existing models from different perspectives and characterize the differences of their generalization abilities through the lens of our proposed measures, which guides us to better design models and training methods. Experiments with in-depth analyses diagnose the bottleneck of existing neural NER models in terms of breakdown performance analysis, annotation errors, dataset bias, and category relationships, which suggest directions for improvement. We have released the datasets: (ReCoNLL, PLONER) for the future research at our project page: http://pfliu.com/InterpretNER/."
Document Summarization with VHTM: Variational Hierarchical Topic-Aware Mechanism,"Automatic text summarization focuses on distilling summary information from texts. This research field has been considerably explored over the past decades because of its significant role in many natural language processing tasks; however, two challenging issues block its further development: (1) how to yield a summarization model embedding topic inference rather than extending with a pre-trained one and (2) how to merge the latent topics into diverse granularity levels. In this study, we propose a variational hierarchical model to holistically address both issues, dubbed VHTM. Different from the previous work assisted by a pre-trained single-grained topic model, VHTM is the first attempt to jointly accomplish summarization with topic inference via variational encoder-decoder and merge topics into multi-grained levels through topic embedding and attention. Comprehensive experiments validate the superior performance of VHTM compared with the baselines, accompanying with semantically consistent topics."
Open Domain Event Text Generation,"Text generation tasks aim at generating human-readable text from different kinds of data. Normally, the generated text only contains the information included in the data and its application is thus restricted to some limited scenarios. In this paper, we extend the task to an open domain event text generation scenario with an entity chain as its skeleton. Specifically, given an entity chain containing several related event entities, the model should retrieve from a trustworthy repository (e.g. Wikipedia) the detailed information of these entities and generate a description text based on the retrieved sentences. We build a new dataset called WikiEvent1 that provides 34K pairs of entity chain and its corresponding description sentences. To solve the problem, we propose a wiki augmented generator framework that contains an encoder, a retriever, and a decoder. The encoder encodes the entity chain into a hidden space while the decoder decodes from the hidden space and generates description text. The retriever retrieves relevant text from a trustworthy repository which provides more information for generation. To alleviate the overfitting problem, we propose a novel random drop component that randomly deletes words from the retrieved sentences making our model more robust for handling long input sentences. We apply the proposed model on the WikiEvent dataset and compare it with a few baselines. The experimental results show that our carefully-designed architecture does help generate better event text, and extensive analysis further uncovers the characteristics of the proposed task."
ABSent: Cross-Lingual Sentence Representation Mapping with Bidirectional GANs,"A number of cross-lingual transfer learning approaches based on neural networks have been proposed for the case when large amounts of parallel text are at our disposal. However, in many real-world settings, the size of parallel annotated training data is restricted. Additionally, prior cross-lingual mapping research has mainly focused on the word level. This raises the question of whether such techniques can also be applied to effortlessly obtain cross-lingually aligned sentence representations. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Bi-directional Sentence Embedding Mapping (ABSent) framework, which learns mappings of cross-lingual sentence representations from limited quantities of parallel data. The experiments show that our method outperforms several technically more powerful approaches, especially under challenging low-resource circumstances. The source code is available from https://github.com/zuohuif/ABSent along with relevant datasets."
Likelihood Ratios and Generative Classifiers for Unsupervised Out-of-Domain Detection in Task Oriented Dialog,"The task of identifying out-of-domain (OOD) input examples directly at test-time has seen renewed interest recently due to increased real world deployment of models. In this work, we focus on OOD detection for natural language sentence inputs to task-based dialog systems. Our findings are three-fold:First, we curate and release ROSTD (Real Out-of-Domain Sentences From Task-oriented Dialog) - a dataset of 4K OOD examples for the publicly available dataset from (Schuster et al. 2019). In contrast to existing settings which synthesize OOD examples by holding out a subset of classes, our examples were authored by annotators with apriori instructions to be out-of-domain with respect to the sentences in an existing dataset.Second, we explore likelihood ratio based approaches as an alternative to currently prevalent paradigms. Specifically, we reformulate and apply these approaches to natural language inputs. We find that they match or outperform the latter on all datasets, with larger improvements on non-artificial OOD benchmarks such as our dataset. Our ablations validate that specifically using likelihood ratios rather than plain likelihood is necessary to discriminate well between OOD and in-domain data.Third, we propose learning a generative classifier and computing a marginal likelihood (ratio) for OOD detection. This allows us to use a principled likelihood while at the same time exploiting training-time labels. We find that this approach outperforms both simple likelihood (ratio) based and other prior approaches. We are hitherto the first to investigate the use of generative classifiers for OOD detection at test-time."
Neural Snowball for Few-Shot Relation Learning,"Knowledge graphs typically undergo open-ended growth of new relations. This cannot be well handled by relation extraction that focuses on pre-defined relations with sufficient training data. To address new relations with few-shot instances, we propose a novel bootstrapping approach, Neural Snowball, to learn new relations by transferring semantic knowledge about existing relations. More specifically, we use Relational Siamese Networks (RSN) to learn the metric of relational similarities between instances based on existing relations and their labeled data. Afterwards, given a new relation and its few-shot instances, we use RSN to accumulate reliable instances from unlabeled corpora; these instances are used to train a relation classifier, which can further identify new facts of the new relation. The process is conducted iteratively like a snowball. Experiments show that our model can gather high-quality instances for better few-shot relation learning and achieves significant improvement compared to baselines. Codes and datasets are released on https://github.com/thunlp/Neural-Snowball."
TANDA: Transfer and Adapt Pre-Trained Transformer Models for Answer Sentence Selection,"We propose TandA, an effective technique for fine-tuning pre-trained Transformer models for natural language tasks. Specifically, we first transfer a pre-trained model into a model for a general task by fine-tuning it with a large and high-quality dataset. We then perform a second fine-tuning step to adapt the transferred model to the target domain. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach for answer sentence selection, which is a well-known inference task in Question Answering. We built a large scale dataset to enable the transfer step, exploiting the Natural Questions dataset. Our approach establishes the state of the art on two well-known benchmarks, WikiQA and TREC-QA, achieving the impressive MAP scores of 92% and 94.3%, respectively, which largely outperform the the highest scores of 83.4% and 87.5% of previous work. We empirically show that TandA generates more stable and robust models reducing the effort required for selecting optimal hyper-parameters. Additionally, we show that the transfer step of TandA makes the adaptation step more robust to noise. This enables a more effective use of noisy datasets for fine-tuning. Finally, we also confirm the positive impact of TandA in an industrial setting, using domain specific datasets subject to different types of noise."
Predictive Engagement: An Efficient Metric for Automatic Evaluation of Open-Domain Dialogue Systems,"User engagement is a critical metric for evaluating the quality of open-domain dialogue systems. Prior work has focused on conversation-level engagement by using heuristically constructed features such as the number of turns and the total time of the conversation. In this paper, we investigate the possibility and efficacy of estimating utterance-level engagement and define a novel metric, predictive engagement, for automatic evaluation of open-domain dialogue systems. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) human annotators have high agreement on assessing utterance-level engagement scores; (2) conversation-level engagement scores can be predicted from properly aggregated utterance-level engagement scores. Furthermore, we show that the utterance-level engagement scores can be learned from data. These scores can be incorporated into automatic evaluation metrics for open-domain dialogue systems to improve the correlation with human judgements. This suggests that predictive engagement can be used as a real-time feedback for training better dialogue models."
Two-Level Transformer and Auxiliary Coherence Modeling for Improved Text Segmentation,"Breaking down the structure of long texts into semantically coherent segments makes the texts more readable and supports downstream applications like summarization and retrieval. Starting from an apparent link between text coherence and segmentation, we introduce a novel supervised model for text segmentation with simple but explicit coherence modeling. Our model – a neural architecture consisting of two hierarchically connected Transformer networks – is a multi-task learning model that couples the sentence-level segmentation objective with the coherence objective that differentiates correct sequences of sentences from corrupt ones. The proposed model, dubbed Coherence-Aware Text Segmentation (CATS), yields state-of-the-art segmentation performance on a collection of benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by coupling CATS with cross-lingual word embeddings, we demonstrate its effectiveness in zero-shot language transfer: it can successfully segment texts in languages unseen in training."
A Large-Scale Dataset for Argument Quality Ranking: Construction and Analysis,"Identifying the quality of free-text arguments has become an important task in the rapidly expanding field of computational argumentation. In this work, we explore the challenging task of argument quality ranking. To this end, we created a corpus of 30,497 arguments carefully annotated for point-wise quality, released as part of this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset annotated for point-wise argument quality, larger by a factor of five than previously released datasets. Moreover, we address the core issue of inducing a labeled score from crowd annotations by performing a comprehensive evaluation of different approaches to this problem. In addition, we analyze the quality dimensions that characterize this dataset. Finally, we present a neural method for argument quality ranking, which outperforms several baselines on our own dataset, as well as previous methods published for another dataset."
Two Birds with One Stone: Investigating Invertible Neural Networks for Inverse Problems in Morphology,"Most problems in natural language processing can be approximated as inverse problems such as analysis and generation at variety of levels from morphological (e.g., cat+Plural↔cats) to semantic (e.g., (call + 1 2)↔“Calculate one plus two.”). Although the tasks in both directions are closely related, general approach in the field has been to design separate models specific for each task. However, having one shared model for both tasks, would help the researchers exploit the common knowledge among these problems with reduced time and memory requirements. We investigate a specific class of neural networks, called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) (Ardizzone et al. 2019) that enable simultaneous optimization in both directions, hence allow addressing of inverse problems via a single model. In this study, we investigate INNs on morphological problems casted as inverse problems. We apply INNs to various morphological tasks with varying ambiguity and show that they provide competitive performance in both directions. We show that they are able to recover the morphological input parameters, i.e., predicting the lemma (e.g., cat) or the morphological tags (e.g., Plural) when run in the reverse direction, without any significant performance drop in the forward direction, i.e., predicting the surface form (e.g., cats)."
Working Memory-Driven Neural Networks with a Novel Knowledge Enhancement Paradigm for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition,"Recognizing implicit discourse relation is a challenging task in discourse analysis, which aims to understand and infer the latent relations between two discourse arguments, such as temporal, comparison. Most of the present models largely focus on learning-based methods that utilize only intra-sentence textual information to identify discourse relations, ignoring the wider contexts beyond the discourse. Moreover, people comprehend the meanings and the relations of discourses, heavily relying on their interconnected working memories (e.g., instant memory, long-term memory). Inspired by this, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Attentive Neural Network (KANN) framework to address these issues. Specifically, it establishes a mutual attention matrix to capture the reciprocal information between two arguments, as instant memory. While implicitly stated knowledge in the arguments is retrieved from external knowledge source and encoded as inter-words semantic connection embeddings to further construct knowledge matrix, as long-term memory. We devise a novel paradigm with two ways by the collaboration of the memories to enrich the argument representation: 1) integrating the knowledge matrix into the mutual attention matrix, which implicitly maps knowledge into the process of capturing asymmetric interactions between two discourse arguments; 2) directly concatenating the argument representations and the semantic connection embeddings, which explicitly supplements knowledge to help discourse understanding. The experimental results on the PDTB also show that our KANN model is effective."
Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Text Classification via DistanceNet-Bandits,"Domain adaptation performance of a learning algorithm on a target domain is a function of its source domain error and a divergence measure between the data distribution of these two domains. We present a study of various distance-based measures in the context of NLP tasks, that characterize the dissimilarity between domains based on sample estimates. We first conduct analysis experiments to show which of these distance measures can best differentiate samples from same versus different domains, and are correlated with empirical results. Next, we develop a DistanceNet model which uses these distance measures, or a mixture of these distance measures, as an additional loss function to be minimized jointly with the task's loss function, so as to achieve better unsupervised domain adaptation. Finally, we extend this model to a novel DistanceNet-Bandit model, which employs a multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically switch between multiple source domains and allow the model to learn an optimal trajectory and mixture of domains for transfer to the low-resource target domain. We conduct experiments on popular sentiment analysis datasets with several diverse domains and show that our DistanceNet model, as well as its dynamic bandit variant, can outperform competitive baselines in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation."
Fine-Tuning by Curriculum Learning for Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation,"Non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models remove the dependence on previous target tokens and generate all target tokens in parallel, resulting in significant inference speedup but at the cost of inferior translation accuracy compared to autoregressive translation (AT) models. Considering that AT models have higher accuracy and are easier to train than NAT models, and both of them share the same model configurations, a natural idea to improve the accuracy of NAT models is to transfer a well-trained AT model to an NAT model through fine-tuning. However, since AT and NAT models differ greatly in training strategy, straightforward fine-tuning does not work well. In this work, we introduce curriculum learning into fine-tuning for NAT. Specifically, we design a curriculum in the fine-tuning process to progressively switch the training from autoregressive generation to non-autoregressive generation. Experiments on four benchmark translation datasets show that the proposed method achieves good improvement (more than 1 BLEU score) over previous NAT baselines in terms of translation accuracy, and greatly speed up (more than 10 times) the inference process over AT baselines."
Multi-Scale Self-Attention for Text Classification,"In this paper, we introduce the prior knowledge, multi-scale structure, into self-attention modules. We propose a Multi-Scale Transformer which uses multi-scale multi-head self-attention to capture features from different scales. Based on the linguistic perspective and the analysis of pre-trained Transformer (BERT) on a huge corpus, we further design a strategy to control the scale distribution for each layer. Results of three different kinds of tasks (21 datasets) show our Multi-Scale Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer consistently and significantly on small and moderate size datasets."
Fact-Aware Sentence Split and Rephrase with Permutation Invariant Training,"Sentence Split and Rephrase aims to break down a complex sentence into several simple sentences with its meaning preserved. Previous studies tend to address the issue by seq2seq learning from parallel sentence pairs, which takes a complex sentence as input and sequentially generates a series of simple sentences. However, the conventional seq2seq learning has two limitations for this task: (1) it does not take into account the facts stated in the long sentence; As a result, the generated simple sentences may miss or inaccurately state the facts in the original sentence. (2) The order variance of the simple sentences to be generated may confuse the seq2seq model during training because the simple sentences derived from the long source sentence could be in any order.To overcome the challenges, we first propose the Fact-aware Sentence Encoding, which enables the model to learn facts from the long sentence and thus improves the precision of sentence split; then we introduce Permutation Invariant Training to alleviate the effects of order variance in seq2seq learning for this task. Experiments on the WebSplit-v1.0 benchmark dataset show that our approaches can largely improve the performance over the previous seq2seq learning approaches. Moreover, an extrinsic evaluation on oie-benchmark verifies the effectiveness of our approaches by an observation that splitting long sentences with our state-of-the-art model as preprocessing is helpful for improving OpenIE performance."
P-SIF: Document Embeddings Using Partition Averaging,"Simple weighted averaging of word vectors often yields effective representations for sentences which outperform sophisticated seq2seq neural models in many tasks. While it is desirable to use the same method to represent documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing long documents involving multiple sentences. One of the key reasons is that a longer document is likely to contain words from many different topics; hence, creating a single vector while ignoring all the topical structure is unlikely to yield an effective document representation. This problem is less acute in single sentences and other short text fragments where the presence of a single topic is most likely. To alleviate this problem, we present P-SIF, a partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document's topical structure into account. In particular, P-SIF learns topic-specific vectors from a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document. We provide theoretical justifications on the correctness of P-SIF. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate P-SIF's effectiveness compared to simple weighted averaging and many other baselines."
CASE: Context-Aware Semantic Expansion,"In this paper, we define and study a new task called Context-Aware Semantic Expansion (CASE). Given a seed term in a sentential context, we aim to suggest other terms that well fit the context as the seed. CASE has many interesting applications such as query suggestion, computer-assisted writing, and word sense disambiguation, to name a few. Previous explorations, if any, only involve some similar tasks, and all require human annotations for evaluation. In this study, we demonstrate that annotations for this task can be harvested at scale from existing corpora, in a fully automatic manner. On a dataset of 1.8 million sentences thus derived, we propose a network architecture that encodes the context and seed term separately before suggesting alternative terms. The context encoder in this architecture can be easily extended by incorporating seed-aware attention. Our experiments demonstrate that competitive results are achieved with appropriate choices of context encoder and attention scoring function."
ManyModalQA: Modality Disambiguation and QA over Diverse Inputs,"We present a new multimodal question answering challenge, ManyModalQA, in which an agent must answer a question by considering three distinct modalities: text, images, and tables. We collect our data by scraping Wikipedia and then utilize crowdsourcing to collect question-answer pairs. Our questions are ambiguous, in that the modality that contains the answer is not easily determined based solely upon the question. To demonstrate this ambiguity, we construct a modality selector (or disambiguator) network, and this model gets substantially lower accuracy on our challenge set, compared to existing datasets, indicating that our questions are more ambiguous. By analyzing this model, we investigate which words in the question are indicative of the modality. Next, we construct a simple baseline ManyModalQA model, which, based on the prediction from the modality selector, fires a corresponding pre-trained state-of-the-art unimodal QA model. We focus on providing the community with a new manymodal evaluation set and only provide a fine-tuning set, with the expectation that existing datasets and approaches will be transferred for most of the training, to encourage low-resource generalization without large, monolithic training sets for each new task. There is a significant gap between our baseline models and human performance; therefore, we hope that this challenge encourages research in end-to-end modality disambiguation and multimodal QA models, as well as transfer learning."
What Do You Mean ‘Why?’: Resolving Sluices in Conversations,"In conversation, we often ask one-word questions such as ‘Why?’ or ‘Who?’. Such questions are typically easy for humans to answer, but can be hard for computers, because their resolution requires retrieving both the right semantic frames and the right arguments from context. This paper introduces the novel ellipsis resolution task of resolving such one-word questions, referred to as sluices in linguistics. We present a crowd-sourced dataset containing annotations of sluices from over 4,000 dialogues collected from conversational QA datasets, as well as a series of strong baseline architectures."
One Homonym per Translation,"The study of homonymy is vital to resolving fundamental problems in lexical semantics. In this paper, we propose four hypotheses that characterize the unique behavior of homonyms in the context of translations, discourses, collocations, and sense clusters. We present a new annotated homonym resource that allows us to test our hypotheses on existing WSD resources. The results of the experiments provide strong empirical evidence for the hypotheses. This study represents a step towards a computational method for distinguishing between homonymy and polysemy, and constructing a definitive inventory of coarse-grained senses."
Interactive Fiction Games: A Colossal Adventure,"A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to understand and communicate with language. Interactive Fiction games are fully text-based simulation environments where a player issues text commands to effect change in the environment and progress through the story. We argue that IF games are an excellent testbed for studying language-based autonomous agents. In particular, IF games combine challenges of combinatorial action spaces, language understanding, and commonsense reasoning. To facilitate rapid development of language-based agents, we introduce Jericho, a learning environment for man-made IF games and conduct a comprehensive study of text-agents across a rich set of games, highlighting directions in which agents can improve."
Latent Relation Language Models,"In this paper, we propose Latent Relation Language Models (LRLMs), a class of language models that parameterizes the joint distribution over the words in a document and the entities that occur therein via knowledge graph relations. This model has a number of attractive properties: it not only improves language modeling performance, but is also able to annotate the posterior probability of entity spans for a given text through relations. Experiments demonstrate empirical improvements over both word-based language models and a previous approach that incorporates knowledge graph information. Qualitative analysis further demonstrates the proposed model's ability to learn to predict appropriate relations in context. 1"
Knowledge-Graph Augmented Word Representations for Named Entity Recognition,"By modeling the context information, ELMo and BERT have successfully improved the state-of-the-art of word representation, and demonstrated their effectiveness on the Named Entity Recognition task. In this paper, in addition to such context modeling, we propose to encode the prior knowledge of entities from an external knowledge base into the representation, and introduce a Knowledge-Graph Augmented Word Representation or KAWR for named entity recognition. Basically, KAWR provides a kind of knowledge-aware representation for words by 1) encoding entity information from a pre-trained KG embedding model with a new recurrent unit (GERU), and 2) strengthening context modeling from knowledge wise by providing a relation attention scheme based on the entity relations defined in KG. We demonstrate that KAWR, as an augmented version of the existing linguistic word representations, promotes F1 scores on 5 datasets in various domains by +0.46∼+2.07. Better generalization is also observed for KAWR on new entities that cannot be found in the training sets."
Improving Neural Relation Extraction with Positive and Unlabeled Learning,"We present a novel approach to improve the performance of distant supervision relation extraction with Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning. This approach first applies reinforcement learning to decide whether a sentence is positive to a given relation, and then positive and unlabeled bags are constructed. In contrast to most previous studies, which mainly use selected positive instances only, we make full use of unlabeled instances and propose two new representations for positive and unlabeled bags. These two representations are then combined in an appropriate way to make bag-level prediction. Experimental results on a widely used real-world dataset demonstrate that this new approach indeed achieves significant and consistent improvements as compared to several competitive baselines."
Emu: Enhancing Multilingual Sentence Embeddings with Semantic Specialization,"We present Emu, a system that semantically enhances multilingual sentence embeddings. Our framework fine-tunes pre-trained multilingual sentence embeddings using two main components: a semantic classifier and a language discriminator. The semantic classifier improves the semantic similarity of related sentences, whereas the language discriminator enhances the multilinguality of the embeddings via multilingual adversarial training. Our experimental results based on several language pairs show that our specialized embeddings outperform the state-of-the-art multilingual sentence embedding model on the task of cross-lingual intent classification using only monolingual labeled data."
Unsupervised Interlingual Semantic Representations from Sentence Embeddings for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer,"As numerous modern NLP models demonstrate high-performance in various tasks when trained with resource-rich language data sets such as those of English, there has been a shift in attention to the idea of applying such learning to low-resource languages via zero-shot or few-shot cross-lingual transfer. While the most prominent efforts made previously on achieving this feat entails the use of parallel corpora for sentence alignment training, we seek to generalize further by assuming plausible scenarios in which such parallel data sets are unavailable. In this work, we present a novel architecture for training interlingual semantic representations on top of sentence embeddings in a completely unsupervised manner, and demonstrate its effectiveness in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in natural language inference task. Furthermore, we showcase a method of leveraging this framework in a few-shot scenario, and finally analyze the distributional and permutational alignment across languages of these interlingual semantic representations."
Knowledge-Enriched Visual Storytelling,"Stories are diverse and highly personalized, resulting in a large possible output space for story generation. Existing end-to-end approaches produce monotonous stories because they are limited to the vocabulary and knowledge in a single training dataset. This paper introduces KG-Story, a three-stage framework that allows the story generation model to take advantage of external Knowledge Graphs to produce interesting stories. KG-Story distills a set of representative words from the input prompts, enriches the word set by using external knowledge graphs, and finally generates stories based on the enriched word set. This distill-enrich-generate framework allows the use of external resources not only for the enrichment phase, but also for the distillation and generation phases. In this paper, we show the superiority of KG-Story for visual storytelling, where the input prompt is a sequence of five photos and the output is a short story. Per the human ranking evaluation, stories generated by KG-Story are on average ranked better than that of the state-of-the-art systems. Our code and output stories are available at https://github.com/zychen423/KE-VIST."
Leveraging Multi-Token Entities in Document-Level Named Entity Recognition,"Most state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems are designed to process each sentence within a document independently. These systems are easy to confuse entity types when the context information in a sentence is not sufficient enough. To utilize the context information within the whole document, most document-level work let neural networks on their own to learn the relation across sentences, which is not intuitive enough for us humans. In this paper, we divide entities to multi-token entities that contain multiple tokens and single-token entities that are composed of a single token. We propose that the context information of multi-token entities should be more reliable in document-level NER for news articles. We design a fusion attention mechanism which not only learns the semantic relevance between occurrences of the same token, but also focuses more on occurrences belonging to multi-tokens entities. To identify multi-token entities, we design an auxiliary task namely ‘Multi-token Entity Classification’ and perform this task simultaneously with document-level NER. This auxiliary task is simplified from NER and doesn't require extra annotation. Experimental results on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and OntoNotesnbm dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art sentence-level and document-level NER methods."
What Makes A Good Story? Designing Composite Rewards for Visual Storytelling,"Previous storytelling approaches mostly focused on optimizing traditional metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and CIDEr. In this paper, we re-examine this problem from a different angle, by looking deep into what defines a natural and topically-coherent story. To this end, we propose three assessment criteria: relevance, coherence and expressiveness, which we observe through empirical analysis could constitute a “high-quality” story to the human eye. We further propose a reinforcement learning framework, ReCo-RL, with reward functions designed to capture the essence of these quality criteria. Experiments on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST) with both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that our ReCo-RL model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines on both traditional metrics and the proposed new criteria."
MALA: Cross-Domain Dialogue Generation with Action Learning,"Response generation for task-oriented dialogues involves two basic components: dialogue planning and surface realization. These two components, however, have a discrepancy in their objectives, i.e., task completion and language quality. To deal with such discrepancy, conditioned response generation has been introduced where the generation process is factorized into action decision and language generation via explicit action representations. To obtain action representations, recent studies learn latent actions in an unsupervised manner based on the utterance lexical similarity. Such an action learning approach is prone to diversities of language surfaces, which may impinge task completion and language quality. To address this issue, we propose multi-stage adaptive latent action learning (MALA) that learns semantic latent actions by distinguishing the effects of utterances on dialogue progress. We model the utterance effect using the transition of dialogue states caused by the utterance and develop a semantic similarity measurement that estimates whether utterances have similar effects. For learning semantic actions on domains without dialogue states, MALA extends the semantic similarity measurement across domains progressively, i.e., from aligning shared actions to learning domain-specific actions. Experiments using multi-domain datasets, SMD and MultiWOZ, show that our proposed model achieves consistent improvements over the baselines models in terms of both task completion and language quality."
Privacy Enhanced Multimodal Neural Representations for Emotion Recognition,"Many mobile applications and virtual conversational agents now aim to recognize and adapt to emotions. To enable this, data are transmitted from users' devices and stored on central servers. Yet, these data contain sensitive information that could be used by mobile applications without user's consent or, maliciously, by an eavesdropping adversary. In this work, we show how multimodal representations trained for a primary task, here emotion recognition, can unintentionally leak demographic information, which could override a selected opt-out option by the user. We analyze how this leakage differs in representations obtained from textual, acoustic, and multimodal data. We use an adversarial learning paradigm to unlearn the private information present in a representation and investigate the effect of varying the strength of the adversarial component on the primary task and on the privacy metric, defined here as the inability of an attacker to predict specific demographic information. We evaluate this paradigm on multiple datasets and show that we can improve the privacy metric while not significantly impacting the performance on the primary task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze how the privacy metric differs across modalities and how multiple privacy concerns can be tackled while still maintaining performance on emotion recognition."
Bayes-Adaptive Monte-Carlo Planning and Learning for Goal-Oriented Dialogues,"We consider a strategic dialogue task, where the ability to infer the other agent's goal is critical to the success of the conversational agent. While this problem can be naturally formulated as Bayesian planning, it is known to be a very difficult problem due to its enormous search space consisting of all possible utterances. In this paper, we introduce an efficient Bayes-adaptive planning algorithm for goal-oriented dialogues, which combines RNN-based dialogue generation and MCTS-based Bayesian planning in a novel way, leading to robust decision-making under the uncertainty of the other agent's goal. We then introduce reinforcement learning for the dialogue agent that uses MCTS as a strong policy improvement operator, casting reinforcement learning as iterative alternation of planning and supervised-learning of self-generated dialogues. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our Bayes-adaptive dialogue planning agent significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in a negotiation dialogue domain. We also show that reinforcement learning via MCTS further improves end-task performance without diverging from human language."
Real-Time Emotion Recognition via Attention Gated Hierarchical Memory Network,"Real-time emotion recognition (RTER) in conversations is significant for developing emotionally intelligent chatting machines. Without the future context in RTER, it becomes critical to build the memory bank carefully for capturing historical context and summarize the memories appropriately to retrieve relevant information. We propose an Attention Gated Hierarchical Memory Network (AGHMN) to address the problems of prior work: (1) Commonly used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for utterance feature extraction are less compatible in the memory modules; (2) Unidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) only allow each historical utterance to have context before it, preventing information propagation in the opposite direction; (3) The Soft Attention for summarizing loses the positional and ordering information of memories, regardless of how the memory bank is built. Particularly, we propose a Hierarchical Memory Network (HMN) with a bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) as the utterance reader and a BiGRU fusion layer for the interaction between historical utterances. For memory summarizing, we propose an Attention GRU (AGRU) where we utilize the attention weights to update the internal state of GRU. We further promote the AGRU to a bidirectional variant (BiAGRU) to balance the contextual information from recent memories and that from distant memories. We conduct experiments on two emotion conversation datasets with extensive analysis, demonstrating the efficacy of our AGHMN models."
MMM: Multi-Stage Multi-Task Learning for Multi-Choice Reading Comprehension,"Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) for question answering (QA), which aims to answer a question given the relevant context passages, is an important way to test the ability of intelligence systems to understand human language. Multiple-Choice QA (MCQA) is one of the most difficult tasks in MRC because it often requires more advanced reading comprehension skills such as logical reasoning, summarization, and arithmetic operations, compared to the extractive counterpart where answers are usually spans of text within given passages. Moreover, most existing MCQA datasets are small in size, making the task even harder. We introduce MMM, a Multi-stage Multi-task learning framework for Multi-choice reading comprehension. Our method involves two sequential stages: coarse-tuning stage using out-of-domain datasets and multi-task learning stage using a larger in-domain dataset to help model generalize better with limited data. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-step attention network (MAN) as the top-level classifier for this task. We demonstrate MMM significantly advances the state-of-the-art on four representative MCQA datasets."
Is BERT Really Robust? A Strong Baseline for Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment,"Machine learning algorithms are often vulnerable to adversarial examples that have imperceptible alterations from the original counterparts but can fool the state-of-the-art models. It is helpful to evaluate or even improve the robustness of these models by exposing the maliciously crafted adversarial examples. In this paper, we present TextFooler, a simple but strong baseline to generate adversarial text. By applying it to two fundamental natural language tasks, text classification and textual entailment, we successfully attacked three target models, including the powerful pre-trained BERT, and the widely used convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate three advantages of this framework: (1) effective—it outperforms previous attacks by success rate and perturbation rate, (2) utility-preserving—it preserves semantic content, grammaticality, and correct types classified by humans, and (3) efficient—it generates adversarial text with computational complexity linear to the text length.1"
SemSUM: Semantic Dependency Guided Neural Abstractive Summarization,"In neural abstractive summarization, the generated summaries often face semantic irrelevance and content deviation from the input sentences. In this work, we incorporate semantic dependency graphs about predicate-argument structure of input sentences into neural abstractive summarization for the problem. We propose a novel semantics dependency guided summarization model (SemSUM), which can leverage the information of original input texts and the corresponding semantic dependency graphs in a complementary way to guide summarization process. We evaluate our model on the English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and MSR abstractive sentence summarization datasets. Experiments show that the proposed model improves semantic relevance and reduces content deviation, and also brings significant improvements on automatic evaluation ROUGE metrics."
Relation Extraction Exploiting Full Dependency Forests,"Dependency syntax has long been recognized as a crucial source of features for relation extraction. Previous work considers 1-best trees produced by a parser during preprocessing. However, error propagation from the out-of-domain parser may impact the relation extraction performance. We propose to leverage full dependency forests for this task, where a full dependency forest encodes all possible trees. Such representations of full dependency forests provide a differentiable connection between a parser and a relation extraction model, and thus we are also able to study adjusting the parser parameters based on end-task loss. Experiments on three datasets show that full dependency forests and parser adjustment give significant improvements over carefully designed baselines, showing state-of-the-art or competitive performances on biomedical or newswire benchmarks."
Monolingual Transfer Learning via Bilingual Translators for Style-Sensitive Paraphrase Generation,"We tackle the low-resource problem in style transfer by employing transfer learning that utilizes abundantly available raw corpora. Our method consists of two steps: pre-training learns to generate a semantically equivalent sentence with an input assured grammaticality, and fine-tuning learns to add a desired style. Pre-training has two options, auto-encoding and machine translation based methods. Pre-training based on AutoEncoder is a simple way to learn these from a raw corpus. If machine translators are available, the model can learn more diverse paraphrasing via roundtrip translation. After these, fine-tuning achieves high-quality paraphrase generation even in situations where only 1k sentence pairs of the parallel corpus for style transfer is available. Experimental results of formality style transfer indicated the effectiveness of both pre-training methods and the method based on roundtrip translation achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Syntactically Look-Ahead Attention Network for Sentence Compression,"Sentence compression is the task of compressing a long sentence into a short one by deleting redundant words. In sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) based models, the decoder unidirectionally decides to retain or delete words. Thus, it cannot usually explicitly capture the relationships between decoded words and unseen words that will be decoded in the future time steps. Therefore, to avoid generating ungrammatical sentences, the decoder sometimes drops important words in compressing sentences. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Seq2Seq model, syntactically look-ahead attention network (SLAHAN), that can generate informative summaries by explicitly tracking both dependency parent and child words during decoding and capturing important words that will be decoded in the future. The results of the automatic evaluation on the Google sentence compression dataset showed that SLAHAN achieved the best kept-token-based-F1, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores of 85.5, 79.3, 71.3 and 79.1, respectively. SLAHAN also improved the summarization performance on longer sentences. Furthermore, in the human evaluation, SLAHAN improved informativeness without losing readability."
Learning to Learn Morphological Inflection for Resource-Poor Languages,"We propose to cast the task of morphological inflection—mapping a lemma to an indicated inflected form—for resource-poor languages as a meta-learning problem. Treating each language as a separate task, we use data from high-resource source languages to learn a set of model parameters that can serve as a strong initialization point for fine-tuning on a resource-poor target language. Experiments with two model architectures on 29 target languages from 3 families show that our suggested approach outperforms all baselines. In particular, it obtains a 31.7% higher absolute accuracy than a previously proposed cross-lingual transfer model and outperforms the previous state of the art by 1.7% absolute accuracy on average over languages."
Weakly Supervised POS Taggers Perform Poorly on Truly Low-Resource Languages,"Part-of-speech (POS) taggers for low-resource languages which are exclusively based on various forms of weak supervision – e.g., cross-lingual transfer, type-level supervision, or a combination thereof – have been reported to perform almost as well as supervised ones. However, weakly supervised POS taggers are commonly only evaluated on languages that are very different from truly low-resource languages, and the taggers use sources of information, like high-coverage and almost error-free dictionaries, which are likely not available for resource-poor languages. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art weakly supervised POS taggers for a typologically diverse set of 15 truly low-resource languages. On these languages, given a realistic amount of resources, even our best model gets only less than half of the words right. Our results highlight the need for new and different approaches to POS tagging for truly low-resource languages."
Infusing Knowledge into the Textual Entailment Task Using Graph Convolutional Networks,"Textual entailment is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Most approaches for solving this problem use only the textual content present in training data. A few approaches have shown that information from external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs (KGs) can add value, in addition to the textual content, by providing background knowledge that may be critical for a task. However, the proposed models do not fully exploit the information in the usually large and noisy KGs, and it is not clear how it can be effectively encoded to be useful for entailment. We present an approach that complements text-based entailment models with information from KGs by (1) using Personalized PageRank to generate contextual subgraphs with reduced noise and (2) encoding these subgraphs using graph convolutional networks to capture the structural and semantic information in KGs. We evaluate our approach on multiple textual entailment datasets and show that the use of external knowledge helps the model to be robust and improves prediction accuracy. This is particularly evident in the challenging BreakingNLI dataset, where we see an absolute improvement of 5-20% over multiple text-based entailment models."
QASC: A Dataset for Question Answering via Sentence Composition,"Composing knowledge from multiple pieces of texts is a key challenge in multi-hop question answering. We present a multi-hop reasoning dataset, Question Answering via Sentence Composition (QASC), that requires retrieving facts from a large corpus and composing them to answer a multiple-choice question. QASC is the first dataset to offer two desirable properties: (a) the facts to be composed are annotated in a large corpus, and (b) the decomposition into these facts is not evident from the question itself. The latter makes retrieval challenging as the system must introduce new concepts or relations in order to discover potential decompositions. Further, the reasoning model must then learn to identify valid compositions of these retrieved facts using common-sense reasoning. To help address these challenges, we provide annotation for supporting facts as well as their composition. Guided by these annotations, we present a two-step approach to mitigate the retrieval challenges. We use other multiple-choice datasets as additional training data to strengthen the reasoning model. Our proposed approach improves over current state-of-the-art language models by 11% (absolute). The reasoning and retrieval problems, however, remain unsolved as this model still lags by 20% behind human performance."
Modality-Balanced Models for Visual Dialogue,"The Visual Dialog task requires a model to exploit both image and conversational context information to generate the next response to the dialogue. However, via manual analysis, we find that a large number of conversational questions can be answered by only looking at the image without any access to the context history, while others still need the conversation context to predict the correct answers. We demonstrate that due to this reason, previous joint-modality (history and image) models over-rely on and are more prone to memorizing the dialogue history (e.g., by extracting certain keywords or patterns in the context information), whereas image-only models are more generalizable (because they cannot memorize or extract keywords from history) and perform substantially better at the primary normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) task metric which allows multiple correct answers. Hence, this observation encourages us to explicitly maintain two models, i.e., an image-only model and an image-history joint model, and combine their complementary abilities for a more balanced multimodal model. We present multiple methods for this integration of the two models, via ensemble and consensus dropout fusion with shared parameters. Empirically, our models achieve strong results on the Visual Dialog challenge 2019 (rank 3 on NDCG and high balance across metrics), and substantially outperform the winner of the Visual Dialog challenge 2018 on most metrics."
Top-Down RST Parsing Utilizing Granularity Levels in Documents,"Some downstream NLP tasks exploit discourse dependency trees converted from RST trees. To obtain better discourse dependency trees, we need to improve the accuracy of RST trees at the upper parts of the structures. Thus, we propose a novel neural top-down RST parsing method. Then, we exploit three levels of granularity in a document, paragraphs, sentences and Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs), to parse a document accurately and efficiently. The parsing is done in a top-down manner for each granularity level, by recursively splitting a larger text span into two smaller ones while predicting nuclearity and relation labels for the divided spans. The results on the RST-DT corpus show that our method achieved the state-of-the-art results, 87.0 unlabeled span score, 74.6 nuclearity labeled span score, and the comparable result with the state-of-the-art, 60.0 relation labeled span score. Furthermore, discourse dependency trees converted from our RST trees also achieved the state-of-the-art results, 64.9 unlabeled attachment score and 48.5 labeled attachment score."
MA-DST: Multi-Attention-Based Scalable Dialog State Tracking,"Task oriented dialog agents provide a natural language interface for users to complete their goal. Dialog State Tracking (DST), which is often a core component of these systems, tracks the system's understanding of the user's goal throughout the conversation. To enable accurate multi-domain DST, the model needs to encode dependencies between past utterances and slot semantics and understand the dialog context, including long-range cross-domain references. We introduce a novel architecture for this task to encode the conversation history and slot semantics more robustly by using attention mechanisms at multiple granularities. In particular, we use cross-attention to model relationships between the context and slots at different semantic levels and self-attention to resolve cross-domain coreferences. In addition, our proposed architecture does not rely on knowing the domain ontologies beforehand and can also be used in a zero-shot setting for new domains or unseen slot values. Our model improves the joint goal accuracy by 5% (absolute) in the full-data setting and by up to 2% (absolute) in the zero-shot setting over the present state-of-the-art on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset."
Deep Attentive Ranking Networks for Learning to Order Sentences,"We present an attention-based ranking framework for learning to order sentences given a paragraph. Our framework is built on a bidirectional sentence encoder and a self-attention based transformer network to obtain an input order invariant representation of paragraphs. Moreover, it allows seamless training using a variety of ranking based loss functions, such as pointwise, pairwise, and listwise ranking. We apply our framework on two tasks: Sentence Ordering and Order Discrimination. Our framework outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on these tasks on a variety of evaluation metrics. We also show that it achieves better results when using pairwise and listwise ranking losses, rather than the pointwise ranking loss, which suggests that incorporating relative positions of two or more sentences in the loss function contributes to better learning."
CSI: A Coarse Sense Inventory for 85% Word Sense Disambiguation,"Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of associating a word in context with one of its meanings. While many works in the past have focused on raising the state of the art, none has even come close to achieving an F-score in the 80% ballpark when using WordNet as its sense inventory. We contend that one of the main reasons for this failure is the excessively fine granularity of this inventory, resulting in senses that are hard to differentiate between, even for an experienced human annotator. In this paper we cope with this long-standing problem by introducing Coarse Sense Inventory (CSI), obtained by linking WordNet concepts to a new set of 45 labels. The results show that the coarse granularity of CSI leads a WSD model to achieve 85.9% F1, while maintaining a high expressive power. Our set of labels also exhibits ease of use in tagging and a descriptiveness that other coarse inventories lack, as demonstrated in two annotation tasks which we performed. Moreover, a few-shot evaluation proves that the class-based nature of CSI allows the model to generalise over unseen or under-represented words."
A General Framework for Implicit and Explicit Debiasing of Distributional Word Vector Spaces,"Distributional word vectors have recently been shown to encode many of the human biases, most notably gender and racial biases, and models for attenuating such biases have consequently been proposed. However, existing models and studies (1) operate on under-specified and mutually differing bias definitions, (2) are tailored for a particular bias (e.g., gender bias) and (3) have been evaluated inconsistently and non-rigorously. In this work, we introduce a general framework for debiasing word embeddings. We operationalize the definition of a bias by discerning two types of bias specification: explicit and implicit. We then propose three debiasing models that operate on explicit or implicit bias specifications and that can be composed towards more robust debiasing. Finally, we devise a full-fledged evaluation framework in which we couple existing bias metrics with newly proposed ones. Experimental findings across three embedding methods suggest that the proposed debiasing models are robust and widely applicable: they often completely remove the bias both implicitly and explicitly without degradation of semantic information encoded in any of the input distributional spaces. Moreover, we successfully transfer debiasing models, by means of cross-lingual embedding spaces, and remove or attenuate biases in distributional word vector spaces of languages that lack readily available bias specifications."
Multi-Task Learning for Metaphor Detection with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Word Sense Disambiguation,"The current deep learning works on metaphor detection have only considered this task independently, ignoring the useful knowledge from the related tasks and knowledge resources. In this work, we introduce two novel mechanisms to improve the performance of the deep learning models for metaphor detection. The first mechanism employs graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) with dependency parse trees to directly connect the words of interest with their important context words for metaphor detection. The GCN networks in this work also present a novel control mechanism to filter the learned representation vectors to retain the most important information for metaphor detection. The second mechanism, on the other hand, features a multi-task learning framework that exploits the similarity between word sense disambiguation and metaphor detection to transfer the knowledge between the two tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, yielding the state-of-the-art performance over several datasets."
Segment-Then-Rank: Non-Factoid Question Answering on Instructional Videos,"We study the problem of non-factoid QA on instructional videos. Existing work focuses either on visual or textual modality of video content, to find matching answers to the question. However, neither is flexible enough for our problem setting of non-factoid answers with varying lengths. Motivated by this, we propose a two-stage model: (a) multimodal segmentation of video into span candidates and (b) length-adaptive ranking of the candidates to the question. First, for segmentation, we propose Segmenter for generating span candidates of diverse length, considering both textual and visual modality. Second, for ranking, we propose Ranker to score the candidates, dynamically combining the two models with complementary strength for both short and long spans respectively. Experimental result demonstrates that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance."
ALOHA: Artificial Learning of Human Attributes for Dialogue Agents,"For conversational AI and virtual assistants to communicate with humans in a realistic way, they must exhibit human characteristics such as expression of emotion and personality. Current attempts toward constructing human-like dialogue agents have presented significant difficulties. We propose Human Level Attributes (HLAs) based on tropes as the basis of a method for learning dialogue agents that can imitate the personalities of fictional characters. Tropes are characteristics of fictional personalities that are observed recurrently and determined by viewers' impressions. By combining detailed HLA data with dialogue data for specific characters, we present a dataset, HLA-Chat, that models character profiles and gives dialogue agents the ability to learn characters' language styles through their HLAs. We then introduce a three-component system, ALOHA (which stands for Artificial Learning of Human Attributes), that combines character space mapping, character community detection, and language style retrieval to build a character (or personality) specific language model. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that two variations of ALOHA, combined with our proposed dataset, can outperform baseline models at identifying the correct dialogue responses of chosen target characters, and are stable regardless of the character's identity, the genre of the show, and the context of the dialogue."
Recursively Binary Modification Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition,"Recently, there has been an increasing interest in identifying named entities with nested structures. Existing models only make independent typing decisions on the entire entity span while ignoring strong modification relations between sub-entity types. In this paper, we present a novel Recursively Binary Modification model for nested named entity recognition. Our model utilizes the modification relations among sub-entities types to infer the head component on top of a Bayesian framework and uses entity head as a strong evidence to determine the type of the entity span. The process is recursive, allowing lower-level entities to help better model those on the outer-level. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first effort that uses modification relation in nested NER task. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in nested NER tasks, and delivers competitive results with state-of-the-art models in flat NER task, without relying on any extra annotations or NLP tools."
GraphER: Token-Centric Entity Resolution with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks,"Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify entity records that refer to the same real-world entity, which is a critical problem in data cleaning and integration. Most of the existing models are attribute-centric, that is, matching entity pairs by comparing similarities of pre-aligned attributes, which require the schemas of records to be identical and are too coarse-grained to capture subtle key information within a single attribute. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based ER model GraphER. Our model is token-centric: the final matching results are generated by directly aggregating token-level comparison features, in which both the semantic and structural information has been softly embedded into token embeddings by training an Entity Record Graph Convolutional Network (ER-GCN). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first effort to do token-centric entity resolution with the help of GCN in entity resolution task. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model stably outperforms state-of-the-art models."
ICD Coding from Clinical Text Using Multi-Filter Residual Convolutional Neural Network,"Automated ICD coding, which assigns the International Classification of Disease codes to patient visits, has attracted much research attention since it can save time and labor for billing. The previous state-of-the-art model utilized one convolutional layer to build document representations for predicting ICD codes. However, the lengths and grammar of text fragments, which are closely related to ICD coding, vary a lot in different documents. Therefore, a flat and fixed-length convolutional architecture may not be capable of learning good document representations. In this paper, we proposed a Multi-Filter Residual Convolutional Neural Network (MultiResCNN) for ICD coding. The innovations of our model are two-folds: it utilizes a multi-filter convolutional layer to capture various text patterns with different lengths and a residual convolutional layer to enlarge the receptive field. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model on the widely-used MIMIC dataset. On the full code set of MIMIC-III, our model outperformed the state-of-the-art model in 4 out of 6 evaluation metrics. On the top-50 code set of MIMIC-III and the full code set of MIMIC-II, our model outperformed all the existing and state-of-the-art models in all evaluation metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/foxlf823/Multi-Filter-Residual-Convolutional-Neural-Network."
Aspect-Aware Multimodal Summarization for Chinese E-Commerce Products,"We present an abstractive summarization system that produces summary for Chinese e-commerce products. This task is more challenging than general text summarization. First, the appearance of a product typically plays a significant role in customers' decisions to buy the product or not, which requires that the summarization model effectively use the visual information of the product. Furthermore, different products have remarkable features in various aspects, such as “energy efficiency” and “large capacity” for refrigerators. Meanwhile, different customers may care about different aspects. Thus, the summarizer needs to capture the most attractive aspects of a product that resonate with potential purchasers. We propose an aspect-aware multimodal summarization model that can effectively incorporate the visual information and also determine the most salient aspects of a product. We construct a large-scale Chinese e-commerce product summarization dataset that contains approximately 1.4 million manually created product summaries that are paired with detailed product information, including an image, a title, and other textual descriptions for each product. The experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that our models significantly outperform the comparative methods in terms of both the ROUGE score and manual evaluations."
Keywords-Guided Abstractive Sentence Summarization,"We study the problem of generating a summary for a given sentence. Existing researches on abstractive sentence summarization ignore that keywords in the input sentence provide significant clues for valuable content, and humans tend to write summaries covering these keywords. In this paper, we propose an abstractive sentence summarization method by applying guidance signals of keywords to both the encoder and the decoder in the sequence-to-sequence model. A multi-task learning framework is adopted to jointly learn to extract keywords and generate a summary for the input sentence. We apply keywords-guided selective encoding strategies to filter source information by investigating the interactions between the input sentence and the keywords. We extend pointer-generator network by a dual-attention and a dual-copy mechanism, which can integrate the semantics of the input sentence and the keywords, and copy words from both the input sentence and the keywords. We demonstrate that multi-task learning and keywords-oriented guidance facilitate sentence summarization task, achieving better performance than the competitive models on the English Gigaword sentence summarization dataset."
Neuron Interaction Based Representation Composition for Neural Machine Translation,"Recent NLP studies reveal that substantial linguistic information can be attributed to single neurons, i.e., individual dimensions of the representation vectors. We hypothesize that modeling strong interactions among neurons helps to better capture complex information by composing the linguistic properties embedded in individual neurons. Starting from this intuition, we propose a novel approach to compose representations learned by different components in neural machine translation (e.g., multi-layer networks or multi-head attention), based on modeling strong interactions among neurons in the representation vectors. Specifically, we leverage bilinear pooling to model pairwise multiplicative interactions among individual neurons, and a low-rank approximation to make the model computationally feasible. We further propose extended bilinear pooling to incorporate first-order representations. Experiments on WMT14 English⇒German and English⇒French translation tasks show that our model consistently improves performances over the SOTA Transformer baseline. Further analyses demonstrate that our approach indeed captures more syntactic and semantic information as expected."
Cross-Lingual Low-Resource Set-to-Description Retrieval for Global E-Commerce,"With the prosperous of cross-border e-commerce, there is an urgent demand for designing intelligent approaches for assisting e-commerce sellers to offer local products for consumers from all over the world. In this paper, we explore a new task of cross-lingual information retrieval, i.e., cross-lingual set-to-description retrieval in cross-border e-commerce, which involves matching product attribute sets in the source language with persuasive product descriptions in the target language. We manually collect a new and high-quality paired dataset, where each pair contains an unordered product attribute set in the source language and an informative product description in the target language. As the dataset construction process is both time-consuming and costly, the new dataset only comprises of 13.5k pairs, which is a low-resource setting and can be viewed as a challenging testbed for model development and evaluation in cross-border e-commerce. To tackle this cross-lingual set-to-description retrieval task, we propose a novel cross-lingual matching network (CLMN) with the enhancement of context-dependent cross-lingual mapping upon the pre-trained monolingual BERT representations. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CLMN yields impressive results on the challenging task and the context-dependent cross-lingual mapping on BERT yields noticeable improvement over the pre-trained multi-lingual BERT model."
Simultaneous Learning of Pivots and Representations for Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification,"Cross-domain sentiment classification aims to leverage useful knowledge from a source domain to mitigate the supervision sparsity in a target domain. A series of approaches depend on the pivot features that behave similarly for polarity prediction in both domains. However, the engineering of such pivot features remains cumbersome and prevents us from learning the disentangled and transferable representations from rich semantic and syntactic information. Towards learning the pivots and representations simultaneously, we propose a new Transferable Pivot Transformer (TPT). Our model consists of two networks: a Pivot Selector that learns to detect transferable n-gram pivots from contexts, and a Transferable Transformer that learns to generate domain-invariant representations by modeling the correlation between pivot and non-pivot words. The Pivot Selector and Transferable Transformer are jointly optimized through end-to-end back-propagation. We experiment with real tasks of cross-domain sentiment classification over 20 domain pairs where our model outperforms prior arts."
RobuTrans: A Robust Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech Model,"Recently, neural network based speech synthesis has achieved outstanding results, by which the synthesized audios are of excellent quality and naturalness. However, current neural TTS models suffer from the robustness issue, which results in abnormal audios (bad cases) especially for unusual text (unseen context). To build a neural model which can synthesize both natural and stable audios, in this paper, we make a deep analysis of why the previous neural TTS models are not robust, based on which we propose RobuTrans (Robust Transformer), a robust neural TTS model based on Transformer. Comparing to TransformerTTS, our model first converts input texts to linguistic features, including phonemic features and prosodic features, then feed them to the encoder. In the decoder, the encoder-decoder attention is replaced with a duration-based hard attention mechanism, and the causal self-attention is replaced with a ""pseudo non-causal attention"" mechanism to model the holistic information of the input. Besides, the position embedding is replaced with a 1-D CNN, since it constrains the maximum length of synthesized audio. With these modifications, our model not only fix the robustness problem, but also achieves on parity MOS (4.36) with TransformerTTS (4.37) and Tacotron2 (4.37) on our general set."
Why Attention? Analyze BiLSTM Deficiency and Its Remedies in the Case of NER,"BiLSTM has been prevalently used as a core module for NER in a sequence-labeling setup. State-of-the-art approaches use BiLSTM with additional resources such as gazetteers, language-modeling, or multi-task supervision to further improve NER. This paper instead takes a step back and focuses on analyzing problems of BiLSTM itself and how exactly self-attention can bring improvements. We formally show the limitation of (CRF-)BiLSTM in modeling cross-context patterns for each word – the XOR limitation. Then, we show that two types of simple cross-structures – self-attention and Cross-BiLSTM – can effectively remedy the problem. We test the practical impacts of the deficiency on real-world NER datasets, OntoNotes 5.0 and WNUT 2017, with clear and consistent improvements over the baseline, up to 8.7% on some of the multi-token entity mentions. We give in-depth analyses of the improvements across several aspects of NER, especially the identification of multi-token mentions. This study should lay a sound foundation for future improvements on sequence-labeling NER1."
"MetaMT, a Meta Learning Method Leveraging Multiple Domain Data for Low Resource Machine Translation","Neural machine translation (NMT) models have achieved state-of-the-art translation quality with a large quantity of parallel corpora available. However, their performance suffers significantly when it comes to domain-specific translations, in which training data are usually scarce. In this paper, we present a novel NMT model with a new word embedding transition technique for fast domain adaption. We propose to split parameters in the model into two groups: model parameters and meta parameters. The former are used to model the translation while the latter are used to adjust the representational space to generalize the model to different domains. We mimic the domain adaptation of the machine translation model to low-resource domains using multiple translation tasks on different domains. A new training strategy based on meta-learning is developed along with the proposed model to update the model parameters and meta parameters alternately. Experiments on datasets of different domains showed substantial improvements of NMT performances on a limited amount of data."
Relevance-Promoting Language Model for Short-Text Conversation,"Despite the effectiveness of sequence-to-sequence framework on the task of Short-Text Conversation (STC), the issue of under-exploitation of training data (i.e., the supervision signals from query text is ignored) still remains unresolved. Also, the adopted maximization-based decoding strategies, inclined to generating the generic responses or responses with repetition, are unsuited to the STC task. In this paper, we propose to formulate the STC task as a language modeling problem and tailor-make a training strategy to adapt a language model for response generation. To enhance generation performance, we design a relevance-promoting transformer language model, which performs additional supervised source attention after the self-attention to increase the importance of informative query tokens in calculating the token-level representation. The model further refines the query representation with relevance clues inferred from its multiple references during training. In testing, we adopt a randomization-over-maximization strategy to reduce the generation of generic responses. Experimental results on a large Chinese STC dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model on relevance metrics and diversity metrics.1"
Towards Zero-Shot Learning for Automatic Phonemic Transcription,"Automatic phonemic transcription tools are useful for low-resource language documentation. However, due to the lack of training sets, only a tiny fraction of languages have phonemic transcription tools. Fortunately, multilingual acoustic modeling provides a solution given limited audio training data. A more challenging problem is to build phonemic transcribers for languages with zero training data. The difficulty of this task is that phoneme inventories often differ between the training languages and the target language, making it infeasible to recognize unseen phonemes. In this work, we address this problem by adopting the idea of zero-shot learning. Our model is able to recognize unseen phonemes in the target language without any training data. In our model, we decompose phonemes into corresponding articulatory attributes such as vowel and consonant. Instead of predicting phonemes directly, we first predict distributions over articulatory attributes, and then compute phoneme distributions with a customized acoustic model. We evaluate our model by training it using 13 languages and testing it using 7 unseen languages. We find that it achieves 7.7% better phoneme error rate on average over a standard multilingual model."
Self-Attention Enhanced Selective Gate with Entity-Aware Embedding for Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction,"Distantly supervised relation extraction intrinsically suffers from noisy labels due to the strong assumption of distant supervision. Most prior works adopt a selective attention mechanism over sentences in a bag to denoise from wrongly labeled data, which however could be incompetent when there is only one sentence in a bag. In this paper, we propose a brand-new light-weight neural framework to address the distantly supervised relation extraction problem and alleviate the defects in previous selective attention framework. Specifically, in the proposed framework, 1) we use an entity-aware word embedding method to integrate both relative position information and head/tail entity embeddings, aiming to highlight the essence of entities for this task; 2) we develop a self-attention mechanism to capture the rich contextual dependencies as a complement for local dependencies captured by piecewise CNN; and 3) instead of using selective attention, we design a pooling-equipped gate, which is based on rich contextual representations, as an aggregator to generate bag-level representation for final relation classification. Compared to selective attention, one major advantage of the proposed gating mechanism is that, it performs stably and promisingly even if only one sentence appears in a bag and thus keeps the consistency across all training examples. The experiments on NYT dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in terms of both AUC and top-n precision metrics."
Span-Based Neural Buffer: Towards Efficient and Effective Utilization of Long-Distance Context for Neural Sequence Models,"Neural sequence model, though widely used for modeling sequential data such as the language model, has sequential recency bias (Kuncoro et al. 2018) to the local context, limiting its full potential to capture long-distance context. To address this problem, this paper proposes augmenting sequence models with a span-based neural buffer that efficiently represents long-distance context, allowing a gate policy network to make interpolated predictions from both the neural buffer and the underlying sequence model. Training this policy network to utilize long-distance context is however challenging due to the simple sentence dominance problem (Marvin and Linzen 2018). To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel training algorithm that combines an annealed maximum likelihood estimation with an intrinsic reward-driven reinforcement learning. Sequence models with the proposed span-based neural buffer significantly improve the state-of-the-art perplexities on the benchmark Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 datasets to 43.9 and 35.2 respectively. We conduct extensive analysis and confirm that the proposed architecture and the training algorithm both contribute to the improvements."
Neural Machine Translation with Joint Representation,"Though early successes of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems are attributed in part to the explicit modelling of the interaction between any two source and target units, e.g., alignment, the recent Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems resort to the attention which partially encodes the interaction for efficiency. In this paper, we employ Joint Representation that fully accounts for each possible interaction. We sidestep the inefficiency issue by refining representations with the proposed efficient attention operation. The resulting Reformer models offer a new Sequence-to-Sequence modelling paradigm besides the Encoder-Decoder framework and outperform the Transformer baseline in either the small scale IWSLT14 German-English, English-German and IWSLT15 Vietnamese-English or the large scale NIST12 Chinese-English translation tasks by about 1 BLEU point. We also propose a systematic model scaling approach, allowing the Reformer model to beat the state-of-the-art Transformer in IWSLT14 German-English and NIST12 Chinese-English with about 50% fewer parameters. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lyy1994/reformer."
End-to-End Trainable Non-Collaborative Dialog System,"End-to-end task-oriented dialog models have achieved promising performance on collaborative tasks where users willingly coordinate with the system to complete a given task. While in non-collaborative settings, for example, negotiation and persuasion, users and systems do not share a common goal. As a result, compared to collaborate tasks, people use social content to build rapport and trust in these non-collaborative settings in order to advance their goals. To handle social content, we introduce a hierarchical intent annotation scheme, which can be generalized to different non-collaborative dialog tasks. Building upon TransferTransfo (Wolf et al. 2019), we propose an end-to-end neural network model to generate diverse coherent responses. Our model utilizes intent and semantic slots as the intermediate sentence representation to guide the generation process. In addition, we design a filter to select appropriate responses based on whether these intermediate representations fit the designed task and conversation constraints. Our non-collaborative dialog model guides users to complete the task while simultaneously keeps them engaged. We test our approach on our newly proposed AntiScam dataset and an existing PersuasionForGood dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that our model outperforms multiple baselines in these two non-collaborative tasks."
Complementary Auxiliary Classifiers for Label-Conditional Text Generation,"Learning to generate text with a given label is a challenging task because natural language sentences are highly variable and ambiguous. It renders difficulties in trade-off between sentence quality and label fidelity. In this paper, we present CARA to alleviate the issue, where two auxiliary classifiers work simultaneously to ensure that (1) the encoder learns disentangled features and (2) the generator produces label-related sentences. Two practical techniques are further proposed to improve the performance, including annealing the learning signal from the auxiliary classifier, and enhancing the encoder with pre-trained language models. To establish a comprehensive benchmark fostering future research, we consider a suite of four datasets, and systematically reproduce three representative methods. CARA shows consistent improvement over the previous methods on the task of label-conditional text generation, and achieves state-of-the-art on the task of attribute transfer."
Explicit Sentence Compression for Neural Machine Translation,"State-of-the-art Transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) systems still follow a standard encoder-decoder framework, in which source sentence representation can be well done by an encoder with self-attention mechanism. Though Transformer-based encoder may effectively capture general information in its resulting source sentence representation, the backbone information, which stands for the gist of a sentence, is not specifically focused on. In this paper, we propose an explicit sentence compression method to enhance the source sentence representation for NMT. In practice, an explicit sentence compression goal used to learn the backbone information in a sentence. We propose three ways, including backbone source-side fusion, target-side fusion, and both-side fusion, to integrate the compressed sentence into NMT. Our empirical tests on the WMT English-to-French and English-to-German translation tasks show that the proposed sentence compression method significantly improves the translation performances over strong baselines."
Global Greedy Dependency Parsing,"Most syntactic dependency parsing models may fall into one of two categories: transition- and graph-based models. The former models enjoy high inference efficiency with linear time complexity, but they rely on the stacking or re-ranking of partially-built parse trees to build a complete parse tree and are stuck with slower training for the necessity of dynamic oracle training. The latter, graph-based models, may boast better performance but are unfortunately marred by polynomial time inference. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing order objective, resulting in a novel dependency parsing model capable of both global (in sentence scope) feature extraction as in graph models and linear time inference as in transitional models. The proposed global greedy parser only uses two arc-building actions, left and right arcs, for projective parsing. When equipped with two extra non-projective arc-building actions, the proposed parser may also smoothly support non-projective parsing. Using multiple benchmark treebanks, including the Penn Treebank (PTB), the CoNLL-X treebanks, and the Universal Dependency Treebanks, we evaluate our parser and demonstrate that the proposed novel parser achieves good performance with faster training and decoding."
MOSS: End-to-End Dialog System Framework with Modular Supervision,"A major bottleneck in training end-to-end task-oriented dialog system is the lack of data. To utilize limited training data more efficiently, we propose Modular Supervision Network (MOSS), an encoder-decoder training framework that could incorporate supervision from various intermediate dialog system modules including natural language understanding, dialog state tracking, dialog policy learning and natural language generation. With only 60% of the training data, MOSS-all (i.e., MOSS with supervision from all four dialog modules) outperforms state-of-the-art models on CamRest676. Moreover, introducing modular supervision has even bigger benefits when the dialog task has a more complex dialog state and action space. With only 40% of the training data, MOSS-all outperforms the state-of-the-art model on a complex laptop network trouble shooting dataset, LaptopNetwork, that we introduced. LaptopNetwork consists of conversations between real customers and customer service agents in Chinese. Moreover, MOSS framework can accommodate dialogs that have supervision from different dialog modules at both framework level and model level. Therefore, MOSS is extremely flexible to update in real-world deployment."
Embedding Compression with Isotropic Iterative Quantization,"Continuous representation of words is a standard component in deep learning-based NLP models. However, representing a large vocabulary requires significant memory, which can cause problems, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. Therefore, in this paper we propose an isotropic iterative quantization (IIQ) approach for compressing embedding vectors into binary ones, leveraging the iterative quantization technique well established for image retrieval, while satisfying the desired isotropic property of PMI based models. Experiments with pre-trained embeddings (i.e., GloVe and HDC) demonstrate a more than thirty-fold compression ratio with comparable and sometimes even improved performance over the original real-valued embedding vectors."
Semi-Supervised Learning on Meta Structure: Multi-Task Tagging and Parsing in Low-Resource Scenarios,"Multi-view learning makes use of diverse models arising from multiple sources of input or different feature subsets for the same task. For example, a given natural language processing task can combine evidence from models arising from character, morpheme, lexical, or phrasal views. The most common strategy with multi-view learning, especially popular in the neural network community, is to unify multiple representations into one unified vector through concatenation, averaging, or pooling, and then build a single-view model on top of the unified representation. As an alternative, we examine whether building one model per view and then unifying the different models can lead to improvements, especially in low-resource scenarios. More specifically, taking inspiration from co-training methods, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on multi-view models through consensus promotion, and investigate whether this improves overall performance. To test the multi-view hypothesis, we use moderately low-resource scenarios for nine languages and test the performance of the joint model for part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing. The proposed model shows significant improvements across the test cases, with average gains of -0.9 ∼ +9.3 labeled attachment score (LAS) points. We also investigate the effect of unlabeled data on the proposed model by varying the amount of training data and by using different domains of unlabeled data."
Hierarchical Attention Network with Pairwise Loss for Chinese Zero Pronoun Resolution,"Recent neural network methods for Chinese zero pronoun resolution didn't take bidirectional attention between zero pronouns and candidate antecedents into consideration, and simply treated the task as a classification task, ignoring the relationship between different candidates of a zero pronoun. To solve these problems, we propose a Hierarchical Attention Network with Pairwise Loss (HAN-PL), for Chinese zero pronoun resolution. In the proposed HAN-PL, we design a two-layer attention model to generate more powerful representations for zero pronouns and candidate antecedents. Furthermore, we propose a novel pairwise loss by introducing the correct-antecedent similarity constraint and the pairwise-margin loss, making the learned model more discriminative. Extensive experiments have been conducted on OntoNotes 5.0 dataset, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the task of Chinese zero pronoun resolution."
Discovering New Intents via Constrained Deep Adaptive Clustering with Cluster Refinement,"Identifying new user intents is an essential task in the dialogue system. However, it is hard to get satisfying clustering results since the definition of intents is strongly guided by prior knowledge. Existing methods incorporate prior knowledge by intensive feature engineering, which not only leads to overfitting but also makes it sensitive to the number of clusters. In this paper, we propose constrained deep adaptive clustering with cluster refinement (CDAC+), an end-to-end clustering method that can naturally incorporate pairwise constraints as prior knowledge to guide the clustering process. Moreover, we refine the clusters by forcing the model to learn from the high confidence assignments. After eliminating low confidence assignments, our approach is surprisingly insensitive to the number of clusters. Experimental results on the three benchmark datasets show that our method can yield significant improvements over strong baselines. 1"
Integrating Linguistic Knowledge to Sentence Paraphrase Generation,"Paraphrase generation aims to rewrite a text with different words while keeping the same meaning. Previous work performs the task based solely on the given dataset while ignoring the availability of external linguistic knowledge. However, it is intuitive that a model can generate more expressive and diverse paraphrase with the help of such knowledge. To fill this gap, we propose Knowledge-Enhanced Paraphrase Network (KEPN), a transformer-based framework that can leverage external linguistic knowledge to facilitate paraphrase generation. (1) The model integrates synonym information from the external linguistic knowledge into the paraphrase generator, which is used to guide the decision on whether to generate a new word or replace it with a synonym. (2) To locate the synonym pairs more accurately, we adopt an incremental encoding scheme to incorporate position information of each synonym. Besides, a multi-task architecture is designed to help the framework jointly learn the selection of synonym pairs and the generation of expressive paraphrase. Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both automatic and human evaluation."
Revision in Continuous Space: Unsupervised Text Style Transfer without Adversarial Learning,"Typical methods for unsupervised text style transfer often rely on two key ingredients: 1) seeking the explicit disentanglement of the content and the attributes, and 2) troublesome adversarial learning. In this paper, we show that neither of these components is indispensable. We propose a new framework that utilizes the gradients to revise the sentence in a continuous space during inference to achieve text style transfer. Our method consists of three key components: a variational auto-encoder (VAE), some attribute predictors (one for each attribute), and a content predictor. The VAE and the two types of predictors enable us to perform gradient-based optimization in the continuous space, which is mapped from sentences in a discrete space, to find the representation of a target sentence with the desired attributes and preserved content. Moreover, the proposed method naturally has the ability to simultaneously manipulate multiple fine-grained attributes, such as sentence length and the presence of specific words, when performing text style transfer tasks. Compared with previous adversarial learning based methods, the proposed method is more interpretable, controllable and easier to train. Extensive experimental studies on three popular text style transfer tasks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art methods."
Joint Character-Level Word Embedding and Adversarial Stability Training to Defend Adversarial Text,"Text classification is a basic task in natural language processing, but the small character perturbations in words can greatly decrease the effectiveness of text classification models, which is called character-level adversarial example attack. There are two main challenges in character-level adversarial examples defense, which are out-of-vocabulary words in word embedding model and the distribution difference between training and inference. Both of these two challenges make the character-level adversarial examples difficult to defend. In this paper, we propose a framework which jointly uses the character embedding and the adversarial stability training to overcome these two challenges. Our experimental results on five text classification data sets show that the models based on our framework can effectively defend character-level adversarial examples, and our models can defend 93.19% gradient-based adversarial examples and 94.83% natural adversarial examples, which outperforms the state-of-the-art defense models."
A Robust Adversarial Training Approach to Machine Reading Comprehension,"Lacking robustness is a serious problem for Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) models. To alleviate this problem, one of the most promising ways is to augment the training dataset with sophisticated designed adversarial examples. Generally, those examples are created by rules according to the observed patterns of successful adversarial attacks. Since the types of adversarial examples are innumerable, it is not adequate to manually design and enrich training data to defend against all types of adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel robust adversarial training approach to improve the robustness of MRC models in a more generic way. Given an MRC model well-trained on the original dataset, our approach dynamically generates adversarial examples based on the parameters of current model and further trains the model by using the generated examples in an iterative schedule. When applied to the state-of-the-art MRC models, including QANET, BERT and ERNIE2.0, our approach obtains significant and comprehensive improvements on 5 adversarial datasets constructed in different ways, without sacrificing the performance on the original SQuAD development set. Moreover, when coupled with other data augmentation strategy, our approach further boosts the overall performance on adversarial datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
HAMNER: Headword Amplified Multi-Span Distantly Supervised Method for Domain Specific Named Entity Recognition,"To tackle Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, supervised methods need to obtain sufficient cleanly annotated data, which is labor and time consuming. On the contrary, distantly supervised methods acquire automatically annotated data using dictionaries to alleviate this requirement. Unfortunately, dictionaries hinder the effectiveness of distantly supervised methods for NER due to its limited coverage, especially in specific domains. In this paper, we aim at the limitations of the dictionary usage and mention boundary detection. We generalize the distant supervision by extending the dictionary with headword based non-exact matching. We apply a function to better weight the matched entity mentions. We propose a span-level model, which classifies all the possible spans then infers the selected spans with a proposed dynamic programming algorithm. Experiments on all three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art distantly supervised methods."
Tensor Graph Convolutional Networks for Text Classification,"Compared to sequential learning models, graph-based neural networks exhibit some excellent properties, such as ability capturing global information. In this paper, we investigate graph-based neural networks for text classification problem. A new framework TensorGCN (tensor graph convolutional networks), is presented for this task. A text graph tensor is firstly constructed to describe semantic, syntactic, and sequential contextual information. Then, two kinds of propagation learning perform on the text graph tensor. The first is intra-graph propagation used for aggregating information from neighborhood nodes in a single graph. The second is inter-graph propagation used for harmonizing heterogeneous information between graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, and the results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our proposed TensorGCN presents an effective way to harmonize and integrate heterogeneous information from different kinds of graphs."
Synchronous Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Text Translation with Interactive Decoding,"Speech-to-text translation (ST), which translates source language speech into target language text, has attracted intensive attention in recent years. Compared to the traditional pipeline system, the end-to-end ST model has potential benefits of lower latency, smaller model size, and less error propagation. However, it is notoriously difficult to implement such a model without transcriptions as intermediate. Existing works generally apply multi-task learning to improve translation quality by jointly training end-to-end ST along with automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, different tasks in this method cannot utilize information from each other, which limits the improvement. Other works propose a two-stage model where the second model can use the hidden state from the first one, but its cascade manner greatly affects the efficiency of training and inference process. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive attention mechanism which enables ASR and ST to perform synchronously and interactively in a single model. Specifically, the generation of transcriptions and translations not only relies on its previous outputs but also the outputs predicted in the other task. Experiments on TED speech translation corpora have shown that our proposed model can outperform strong baselines on the quality of speech translation and achieve better speech recognition performances as well."
CatGAN: Category-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks with Hierarchical Evolutionary Learning for Category Text Generation,"Generating multiple categories of texts is a challenging task and draws more and more attention. Since generative adversarial nets (GANs) have shown competitive results on general text generation, they are extended for category text generation in some previous works. However, the complicated model structures and learning strategies limit their performance and exacerbate the training instability. This paper proposes a category-aware GAN (CatGAN) which consists of an efficient category-aware model for category text generation and a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm for training our model. The category-aware model directly measures the gap between real samples and generated samples on each category, then reducing this gap will guide the model to generate high-quality category samples. The Gumbel-Softmax relaxation further frees our model from complicated learning strategies for updating CatGAN on discrete data. Moreover, only focusing on the sample quality normally leads the mode collapse problem, thus a hierarchical evolutionary learning algorithm is introduced to stabilize the training procedure and obtain the trade-off between quality and diversity while training CatGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that CatGAN outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art methods."
Attention-Informed Mixed-Language Training for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"Recently, data-driven task-oriented dialogue systems have achieved promising performance in English. However, developing dialogue systems that support low-resource languages remains a long-standing challenge due to the absence of high-quality data. In order to circumvent the expensive and time-consuming data collection, we introduce Attention-Informed Mixed-Language Training (MLT), a novel zero-shot adaptation method for cross-lingual task-oriented dialogue systems. It leverages very few task-related parallel word pairs to generate code-switching sentences for learning the inter-lingual semantics across languages. Instead of manually selecting the word pairs, we propose to extract source words based on the scores computed by the attention layer of a trained English task-related model and then generate word pairs using existing bilingual dictionaries. Furthermore, intensive experiments with different cross-lingual embeddings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, with very few word pairs, our model achieves significant zero-shot adaptation performance improvements in both cross-lingual dialogue state tracking and natural language understanding (i.e., intent detection and slot filling) tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches, which utilize a much larger amount of bilingual data."
Hierarchical Contextualized Representation for Named Entity Recognition,"Named entity recognition (NER) models are typically based on the architecture of Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM). The constraints of sequential nature and the modeling of single input prevent the full utilization of global information from larger scope, not only in the entire sentence, but also in the entire document (dataset). In this paper, we address these two deficiencies and propose a model augmented with hierarchical contextualized representation: sentence-level representation and document-level representation. In sentence-level, we take different contributions of words in a single sentence into consideration to enhance the sentence representation learned from an independent BiLSTM via label embedding attention mechanism. In document-level, the key-value memory network is adopted to record the document-aware information for each unique word which is sensitive to similarity of context information. Our two-level hierarchical contextualized representations are fused with each input token embedding and corresponding hidden state of BiLSTM, respectively. The experimental results on three benchmark NER datasets (CoNLL-2003 and Ontonotes 5.0 English datasets, CoNLL-2002 Spanish dataset) show that we establish new state-of-the-art results."
Graph-Based Reasoning over Heterogeneous External Knowledge for Commonsense Question Answering,"Commonsense question answering aims to answer questions which require background knowledge that is not explicitly expressed in the question. The key challenge is how to obtain evidence from external knowledge and make predictions based on the evidence. Recent studies either learn to generate evidence from human-annotated evidence which is expensive to collect, or extract evidence from either structured or unstructured knowledge bases which fails to take advantages of both sources simultaneously. In this work, we propose to automatically extract evidence from heterogeneous knowledge sources, and answer questions based on the extracted evidence. Specifically, we extract evidence from both structured knowledge base (i.e. ConceptNet) and Wikipedia plain texts. We construct graphs for both sources to obtain the relational structures of evidence. Based on these graphs, we propose a graph-based approach consisting of a graph-based contextual word representation learning module and a graph-based inference module. The first module utilizes graph structural information to re-define the distance between words for learning better contextual word representations. The second module adopts graph convolutional network to encode neighbor information into the representations of nodes, and aggregates evidence with graph attention mechanism for predicting the final answer. Experimental results on CommonsenseQA dataset illustrate that our graph-based approach over both knowledge sources brings improvement over strong baselines. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy (75.3%) on the CommonsenseQA dataset."
FPETS: Fully Parallel End-to-End Text-to-Speech System,"End-to-end Text-to-speech (TTS) system can greatly improve the quality of synthesised speech. But it usually suffers form high time latency due to its auto-regressive structure. And the synthesised speech may also suffer from some error modes, e.g. repeated words, mispronunciations, and skipped words. In this paper, we propose a novel non-autoregressive, fully parallel end-to-end TTS system (FPETS). It utilizes a new alignment model and the recently proposed U-shape convolutional structure, UFANS. Different from RNN, UFANS can capture long term information in a fully parallel manner. Trainable position encoding and two-step training strategy are used for learning better alignments. Experimental results show FPETS utilizes the power of parallel computation and reaches a significant speed up of inference compared with state-of-the-art end-to-end TTS systems. More specifically, FPETS is 600X faster than Tacotron2, 50X faster than DCTTS and 10X faster than Deep Voice3. And FPETS can generates audios with equal or better quality and fewer errors comparing with other system. As far as we know, FPETS is the first end-to-end TTS system which is fully parallel."
Improving Question Generation with Sentence-Level Semantic Matching and Answer Position Inferring,"Taking an answer and its context as input, sequence-to-sequence models have made considerable progress on question generation. However, we observe that these approaches often generate wrong question words or keywords and copy answer-irrelevant words from the input. We believe that lacking global question semantics and exploiting answer position-awareness not well are the key root causes. In this paper, we propose a neural question generation model with two general modules: sentence-level semantic matching and answer position inferring. Further, we enhance the initial state of the decoder by leveraging the answer-aware gated fusion mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on SQuAD and MARCO datasets. Owing to its generality, our work also improves the existing models significantly."
CAWA: An Attention-Network for Credit Attribution,"Credit attribution is the task of associating individual parts in a document with their most appropriate class labels. It is an important task with applications to information retrieval and text summarization. When labeled training data is available, traditional approaches for sequence tagging can be used for credit attribution. However, generating such labeled datasets is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present Credit Attribution With Attention (CAWA), a neural-network-based approach, that instead of using sentence-level labeled data, uses the set of class labels that are associated with an entire document as a source of distant-supervision. CAWA combines an attention mechanism with a multilabel classifier into an end-to-end learning framework to perform credit attribution. CAWA labels the individual sentences from the input document using the resultant attention-weights. CAWA improves upon the state-of-the-art credit attribution approach by not constraining a sentence to belong to just one class, but modeling each sentence as a distribution over all classes, leading to better modeling of semantically-similar classes. Experiments on the credit attribution task on a variety of datasets show that the sentence class labels generated by CAWA outperform the competing approaches. Additionally, on the multilabel text classification task, CAWA performs better than the competing credit attribution approaches1."
Robust Named Entity Recognition with Truecasing Pretraining,"Although modern named entity recognition (NER) systems show impressive performance on standard datasets, they perform poorly when presented with noisy data. In particular, capitalization is a strong signal for entities in many languages, and even state of the art models overfit to this feature, with drastically lower performance on uncapitalized text. In this work, we address the problem of robustness of NER systems in data with noisy or uncertain casing, using a pretraining objective that predicts casing in text, or a truecaser, leveraging unlabeled data. The pretrained truecaser is combined with a standard BiLSTM-CRF model for NER by appending output distributions to character embeddings. In experiments over several datasets of varying domain and casing quality, we show that our new model improves performance in uncased text, even adding value to uncased BERT embeddings. Our method achieves a new state of the art on the WNUT17 shared task dataset."
Simplify-Then-Translate: Automatic Preprocessing for Black-Box Translation,"Black-box machine translation systems have proven incredibly useful for a variety of applications yet by design are hard to adapt, tune to a specific domain, or build on top of. In this work, we introduce a method to improve such systems via automatic pre-processing (APP) using sentence simplification. We first propose a method to automatically generate a large in-domain paraphrase corpus through back-translation with a black-box MT system, which is used to train a paraphrase model that “simplifies” the original sentence to be more conducive for translation. The model is used to preprocess source sentences of multiple low-resource language pairs. We show that this preprocessing leads to better translation performance as compared to non-preprocessed source sentences. We further perform side-by-side human evaluation to verify that translations of the simplified sentences are better than the original ones. Finally, we provide some guidance on recommended language pairs for generating the simplification model corpora by investigating the relationship between ease of translation of a language pair (as measured by BLEU) and quality of the resulting simplification model from back-translations of this language pair (as measured by SARI), and tie this into the downstream task of low-resource translation."
RefNet: A Reference-Aware Network for Background Based Conversation,"Existing conversational systems tend to generate generic responses. Recently, Background Based Conversation (BBCs) have been introduced to address this issue. Here, the generated responses are grounded in some background information. The proposed methods for BBCs are able to generate more informative responses, however, they either cannot generate natural responses or have difficulties in locating the right background information. In this paper, we propose a Reference-aware Network (RefNet) to address both issues. Unlike existing methods that generate responses token by token, RefNet incorporates a novel reference decoder that provides an alternative way to learn to directly select a semantic unit (e.g., a span containing complete semantic information) from the background. Experimental results show that RefNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluations, indicating that RefNet can generate more appropriate and human-like responses."
Enhancing Natural Language Inference Using New and Expanded Training Data Sets and New Learning Models,"Natural Language Inference (NLI) plays an important role in many natural language processing tasks such as question answering. However, existing NLI modules that are trained on existing NLI datasets have several drawbacks. For example, they do not capture the notion of entity and role well and often end up making mistakes such as “Peter signed a deal” can be inferred from “John signed a deal”. As part of this work, we have developed two datasets that help mitigate such issues and make the systems better at understanding the notion of “entities” and “roles”. After training the existing models on the new dataset we observe that the existing models do not perform well on one of the new benchmark. We then propose a modification to the “word-to-word” attention function which has been uniformly reused across several popular NLI architectures. The resulting models perform as well as their unmodified counterparts on the existing benchmarks and perform significantly well on the new benchmarks that emphasize “roles” and “entities”."
TRENDNERT: A Benchmark for Trend and Downtrend Detection in a Scientific Domain,"Computational analysis and modeling of the evolution of trends is an important area of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) because of its socio-economic impact. However, no large publicly available benchmark for trend detection currently exists, making a comparative evaluation of methods impossible. We remedy this situation by publishing the benchmark TRENDNERT, consisting of a set of gold trends and downtrends and document labels that is available as an unrestricted download, and a large underlying document collection that can also be obtained for free. We propose Mean Average Precision (MAP) as an evaluation measure for trend detection and apply this measure in an investigation of several baselines."
Conclusion-Supplement Answer Generation for Non-Factoid Questions,"This paper tackles the goal of conclusion-supplement answer generation for non-factoid questions, which is a critical issue in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as users often require supplementary information before accepting a conclusion. The current encoder-decoder framework, however, has difficulty generating such answers, since it may become confused when it tries to learn several different long answers to the same non-factoid question. Our solution, called an ensemble network, goes beyond single short sentences and fuses logically connected conclusion statements and supplementary statements. It extracts the context from the conclusion decoder's output sequence and uses it to create supplementary decoder states on the basis of an attention mechanism. It also assesses the closeness of the question encoder's output sequence and the separate outputs of the conclusion and supplement decoders as well as their combination. As a result, it generates answers that match the questions and have natural-sounding supplementary sequences in line with the context expressed by the conclusion sequence. Evaluations conducted on datasets including “Love Advice” and “Arts & Humanities” categories indicate that our model outputs much more accurate results than the tested baseline models do."
Effective Modeling of Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction,"A relation tuple consists of two entities and the relation between them, and often such tuples are found in unstructured text. There may be multiple relation tuples present in a text and they may share one or both entities among them. Extracting such relation tuples from a sentence is a difficult task and sharing of entities or overlapping entities among the tuples makes it more challenging. Most prior work adopted a pipeline approach where entities were identified first followed by finding the relations among them, thus missing the interaction among the relation tuples in a sentence. In this paper, we propose two approaches to use encoder-decoder architecture for jointly extracting entities and relations. In the first approach, we propose a representation scheme for relation tuples which enables the decoder to generate one word at a time like machine translation models and still finds all the tuples present in a sentence with full entity names of different length and with overlapping entities. Next, we propose a pointer network-based decoding approach where an entire tuple is generated at every time step. Experiments on the publicly available New York Times corpus show that our proposed approaches outperform previous work and achieve significantly higher F1 scores."
Merging Weak and Active Supervision for Semantic Parsing,"A semantic parser maps natural language commands (NLs) from the users to executable meaning representations (MRs), which are later executed in certain environment to obtain user-desired results. The fully-supervised training of such parser requires NL/MR pairs, annotated by domain experts, which makes them expensive to collect. However, weakly-supervised semantic parsers are learnt only from pairs of NL and expected execution results, leaving the MRs latent. While weak supervision is cheaper to acquire, learning from this input poses difficulties. It demands that parsers search a large space with a very weak learning signal and it is hard to avoid spurious MRs that achieve the correct answer in the wrong way. These factors lead to a performance gap between parsers trained in weakly- and fully-supervised setting. To bridge this gap, we examine the intersection between weak supervision and active learning, which allows the learner to actively select examples and query for manual annotations as extra supervision to improve the model trained under weak supervision. We study different active learning heuristics for selecting examples to query, and various forms of extra supervision for such queries. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two different datasets. Experiments on the WikiSQL show that by annotating only 1.8% of examples, we improve over a state-of-the-art weakly-supervised baseline by 6.4%, achieving an accuracy of 79.0%, which is only 1.3% away from the model trained with full supervision. Experiments on WikiTableQuestions with human annotators show that our method can improve the performance with only 100 active queries, especially for weakly-supervised parsers learnt from a cold start. 1"
Message Passing Attention Networks for Document Understanding,"Graph neural networks have recently emerged as a very effective framework for processing graph-structured data. These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. Most graph neural networks can be described in terms of message passing, vertex update, and readout functions. In this paper, we represent documents as word co-occurrence networks and propose an application of the message passing framework to NLP, the Message Passing Attention network for Document understanding (MPAD). We also propose several hierarchical variants of MPAD. Experiments conducted on 10 standard text classification datasets show that our architectures are competitive with the state-of-the-art. Ablation studies reveal further insights about the impact of the different components on performance. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/giannisnik/mpad."
Deep Residual-Dense Lattice Network for Speech Enhancement,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with residual links (ResNets) and causal dilated convolutional units have been the network of choice for deep learning approaches to speech enhancement. While residual links improve gradient flow during training, feature diminution of shallow layer outputs can occur due to repetitive summations with deeper layer outputs. One strategy to improve feature re-usage is to fuse both ResNets and densely connected CNNs (DenseNets). DenseNets, however, over-allocate parameters for feature re-usage. Motivated by this, we propose the residual-dense lattice network (RDL-Net), which is a new CNN for speech enhancement that employs both residual and dense aggregations without over-allocating parameters for feature re-usage. This is managed through the topology of the RDL blocks, which limit the number of outputs used for dense aggregations. Our extensive experimental investigation shows that RDL-Nets are able to achieve a higher speech enhancement performance than CNNs that employ residual and/or dense aggregations. RDL-Nets also use substantially fewer parameters and have a lower computational requirement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RDL-Nets outperform many state-of-the-art deep learning approaches to speech enhancement. Availability: https://github.com/nick-nikzad/RDL-SE."
AvgOut: A Simple Output-Probability Measure to Eliminate Dull Responses,"Many sequence-to-sequence dialogue models tend to generate safe, uninformative responses. There have been various useful efforts on trying to eliminate them. However, these approaches either improve decoding algorithms during inference, rely on hand-crafted features, or employ complex models. In our work, we build dialogue models that are dynamically aware of what utterances or tokens are dull without any feature-engineering. Specifically, we start with a simple yet effective automatic metric, AvgOut, which calculates the average output probability distribution of all time steps on the decoder side during training. This metric directly estimates which tokens are more likely to be generated, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). We then leverage this novel metric to propose three models that promote diversity without losing relevance. The first model, MinAvgOut, directly maximizes the diversity score through the output distributions of each batch; the second model, Label Fine-Tuning (LFT), prepends to the source sequence a label continuously scaled by the diversity score to control the diversity level; the third model, RL, adopts Reinforcement Learning and treats the diversity score as a reward signal. Moreover, we experiment with a hybrid model by combining the loss terms of MinAvgOut and RL. All four models outperform their base LSTM-RNN model on both diversity and relevance by a large margin, and are comparable to or better than competitive baselines (also verified via human evaluation). Moreover, our approaches are orthogonal to the base model, making them applicable as an add-on to other emerging better dialogue models in the future."
Controlling Neural Machine Translation Formality with Synthetic Supervision,"This work aims to produce translations that convey source language content at a formality level that is appropriate for a particular audience. Framing this problem as a neural sequence-to-sequence task ideally requires training triplets consisting of a bilingual sentence pair labeled with target language formality. However, in practice, available training examples are limited to English sentence pairs of different styles, and bilingual parallel sentences of unknown formality. We introduce a novel training scheme for multi-task models that automatically generates synthetic training triplets by inferring the missing element on the fly, thus enabling end-to-end training. Comprehensive automatic and human assessments show that our best model outperforms existing models by producing translations that better match desired formality levels while preserving the source meaning.1"
Fine-Grained Entity Typing for Domain Independent Entity Linking,"Neural entity linking models are very powerful, but run the risk of overfitting to the domain they are trained in. For this problem, a “domain” is characterized not just by genre of text but even by factors as specific as the particular distribution of entities, as neural models tend to overfit by memorizing properties of frequent entities in a dataset. We tackle the problem of building robust entity linking models that generalize effectively and do not rely on labeled entity linking data with a specific entity distribution. Rather than predicting entities directly, our approach models fine-grained entity properties, which can help disambiguate between even closely related entities. We derive a large inventory of types (tens of thousands) from Wikipedia categories, and use hyperlinked mentions in Wikipedia to distantly label data and train an entity typing model. At test time, we classify a mention with this typing model and use soft type predictions to link the mention to the most similar candidate entity. We evaluate our entity linking system on the CoNLL-YAGO dataset (Hoffart et al. 2011) and show that our approach outperforms prior domain-independent entity linking systems. We also test our approach in a harder setting derived from the WikilinksNED dataset (Eshel et al. 2017) where all the mention-entity pairs are unseen during test time. Results indicate that our approach generalizes better than a state-of-the-art neural model on the dataset."
Mask & Focus: Conversation Modelling by Learning Concepts,"Sequence to sequence models attempt to capture the correlation between all the words in the input and output sequences. While this is quite useful for machine translation where the correlation among the words is indeed quite strong, it becomes problematic for conversation modelling where the correlation is often at a much abstract level. In contrast, humans tend to focus on the essential concepts discussed in the conversation context and generate responses accordingly. In this paper, we attempt to mimic this response generating mechanism by learning the essential concepts in the context and response in an unsupervised manner. The proposed model, referred to as Mask & Focus maps the input context to a sequence of concepts which are then used to generate the response concepts. Together, the context and the response concepts generate the final response. In order to learn context concepts from the training data automatically, we mask words in the input and observe the effect of masking on response generation. We train our model to learn those response concepts that have high mutual information with respect to the context concepts, thereby guiding the model to focus on the context concepts. Mask & Focus achieves significant improvement over the existing baselines in several established metrics for dialogues."
Associating Natural Language Comment and Source Code Entities,"Comments are an integral part of software development; they are natural language descriptions associated with source code elements. Understanding explicit associations can be useful in improving code comprehensibility and maintaining the consistency between code and comments. As an initial step towards this larger goal, we address the task of associating entities in Javadoc comments with elements in Java source code. We propose an approach for automatically extracting supervised data using revision histories of open source projects and present a manually annotated evaluation dataset for this task. We develop a binary classifier and a sequence labeling model by crafting a rich feature set which encompasses various aspects of code, comments, and the relationships between them. Experiments show that our systems outperform several baselines learning from the proposed supervision."
"Knowing What, How and Why: A Near Complete Solution for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis","Target-based sentiment analysis or aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) refers to addressing various sentiment analysis tasks at a fine-grained level, which includes but is not limited to aspect extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and opinion extraction. There exist many solvers of the above individual subtasks or a combination of two subtasks, and they can work together to tell a complete story, i.e. the discussed aspect, the sentiment on it, and the cause of the sentiment. However, no previous ABSA research tried to provide a complete solution in one shot. In this paper, we introduce a new subtask under ABSA, named aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE). Particularly, a solver of this task needs to extract triplets (What, How, Why) from the inputs, which show WHAT the targeted aspects are, HOW their sentiment polarities are and WHY they have such polarities (i.e. opinion reasons). For instance, one triplet from “Waiters are very friendly and the pasta is simply average” could be (‘Waiters’, positive, ‘friendly’). We propose a two-stage framework to address this task. The first stage predicts what, how and why in a unified model, and then the second stage pairs up the predicted what (how) and why from the first stage to output triplets. In the experiments, our framework has set a benchmark performance in this novel triplet extraction task. Meanwhile, it outperforms a few strong baselines adapted from state-of-the-art related methods."
MTSS: Learn from Multiple Domain Teachers and Become a Multi-Domain Dialogue Expert,"How to build a high-quality multi-domain dialogue system is a challenging work due to its complicated and entangled dialogue state space among each domain, which seriously limits the quality of dialogue policy, and further affects the generated response. In this paper, we propose a novel method to acquire a satisfying policy and subtly circumvent the knotty dialogue state representation problem in the multi-domain setting. Inspired by real school teaching scenarios, our method is composed of multiple domain-specific teachers and a universal student. Each individual teacher only focuses on one specific domain and learns its corresponding domain knowledge and dialogue policy based on a precisely extracted single domain dialogue state representation. Then, these domain-specific teachers impart their domain knowledge and policies to a universal student model and collectively make this student model a multi-domain dialogue expert. Experiment results show that our method reaches competitive results with SOTAs in both multi-domain and single domain setting."
Verb Class Induction with Partial Supervision,"Dirichlet-multinomial (D-M) mixtures like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are widely used for both topic modeling and clustering. Prior work on constructing Levin-style semantic verb clusters achieves state-of-the-art results using D-M mixtures for verb sense induction and clustering. We add a bias toward known clusters by explicitly labeling a small number of observations with their correct VerbNet class. We demonstrate that this partial supervision guides the resulting clusters effectively, improving the recovery of both labeled and unlabeled classes by 16%, for a joint 12% absolute improvement in F1 score compared to clustering without supervision. The resulting clusters are also more semantically coherent. Although the technical change is minor, it produces a large effect, with important practical consequences for supervised topic modeling in general."
Towards Building a Multilingual Sememe Knowledge Base: Predicting Sememes for BabelNet Synsets,"A sememe is defined as the minimum semantic unit of human languages. Sememe knowledge bases (KBs), which contain words annotated with sememes, have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks. However, existing sememe KBs are built on only a few languages, which hinders their widespread utilization. To address the issue, we propose to build a unified sememe KB for multiple languages based on BabelNet, a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary. We first build a dataset serving as the seed of the multilingual sememe KB. It manually annotates sememes for over 15 thousand synsets (the entries of BabelNet). Then, we present a novel task of automatic sememe prediction for synsets, aiming to expand the seed dataset into a usable KB. We also propose two simple and effective models, which exploit different information of synsets. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses to explore important factors and difficulties in the task. All the source code and data of this work can be obtained on https://github.com/thunlp/BabelNet-Sememe-Prediction."
Translation-Based Matching Adversarial Network for Cross-Lingual Natural Language Inference,"Cross-lingual natural language inference is a fundamental task in cross-lingual natural language understanding, widely addressed by neural models recently. Existing neural model based methods either align sentence embeddings between source and target languages, heavily relying on annotated parallel corpora, or exploit pre-trained cross-lingual language models that are fine-tuned on a single language and hard to transfer knowledge to another language. To resolve these limitations in existing methods, this paper proposes an adversarial training framework to enhance both pre-trained models and classical neural models for cross-lingual natural language inference. It trains on the union of data in the source language and data in the target language, learning language-invariant features to improve the inference performance. Experimental results on the XNLI benchmark demonstrate that three popular neural models enhanced by the proposed framework significantly outperform the original models."
Solving Sequential Text Classification as Board-Game Playing,"Sequential Text Classification (STC) aims to classify a sequence of text fragments (e.g., words in a sentence or sentences in a document) into a sequence of labels. In addition to the intra-fragment text contents, considering the inter-fragment context dependencies is also important for STC. Previous sequence labeling approaches largely generate a sequence of labels in left-to-right reading order. However, the need for context information in making decisions varies across different fragments and is not strictly organized in a left-to-right order. Therefore, it is appealing to label the fragments that need less consideration of context information first before labeling the fragments that need more. In this paper, we propose a novel model that labels a sequence of fragments in jumping order. Specifically, we devise a dedicated board-game to develop a correspondence between solving STC and board-game playing. By defining proper game rules and devising a game state evaluator in which context clues are injected, at each round, each player is effectively pushed to find the optimal move without position restrictions via considering the current game state, which corresponds to producing a label for an unlabeled fragment jumpily with the consideration of the contexts clues. The final game-end state is viewed as the optimal label sequence. Extensive results on three representative datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance."
Lexical Simplification with Pretrained Encoders,"Lexical simplification (LS) aims to replace complex words in a given sentence with their simpler alternatives of equivalent meaning. Recently unsupervised lexical simplification approaches only rely on the complex word itself regardless of the given sentence to generate candidate substitutions, which will inevitably produce a large number of spurious candidates. We present a simple LS approach that makes use of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) which can consider both the given sentence and the complex word during generating candidate substitutions for the complex word. Specifically, we mask the complex word of the original sentence for feeding into the BERT to predict the masked token. The predicted results will be used as candidate substitutions. Despite being entirely unsupervised, experimental results show that our approach obtains obvious improvement compared with these baselines leveraging linguistic databases and parallel corpus, outperforming the state-of-the-art by more than 12 Accuracy points on three well-known benchmarks."
Dynamic Knowledge Routing Network for Target-Guided Open-Domain Conversation,"Target-guided open-domain conversation aims to proactively and naturally guide a dialogue agent or human to achieve specific goals, topics or keywords during open-ended conversations. Existing methods mainly rely on single-turn data-driven learning and simple target-guided strategy without considering semantic or factual knowledge relations among candidate topics/keywords. This results in poor transition smoothness and low success rate. In this work, we adopt a structured approach that controls the intended content of system responses by introducing coarse-grained keywords, attains smooth conversation transition through turn-level supervised learning and knowledge relations between candidate keywords, and drives an conversation towards an specified target with discourse-level guiding strategy. Specially, we propose a novel dynamic knowledge routing network (DRKN) which considers semantic knowledge relations among candidate keywords for accurate next topic prediction of next discourse. With the help of more accurate keyword prediction, our keyword-augmented response retrieval module can achieve better retrieval performance and more meaningful conversations. Besides, we also propose a novel dual discourse-level target-guided strategy to guide conversations to reach their goals smoothly with higher success rate. Furthermore, to push the research boundary of target-guided open-domain conversation to match real-world scenarios better, we introduce a new large-scale Chinese target-guided open-domain conversation dataset (more than 900K conversations) crawled from Sina Weibo. Quantitative and human evaluations show our method can produce meaningful and effective target-guided conversations, significantly improving over other state-of-the-art methods by more than 20% in success rate and more than 0.6 in average smoothness score."
DCR-Net: A Deep Co-Interactive Relation Network for Joint Dialog Act Recognition and Sentiment Classification,"In dialog system, dialog act recognition and sentiment classification are two correlative tasks to capture speakers' intentions, where dialog act and sentiment can indicate the explicit and the implicit intentions separately (Kim and Kim 2018). Most of the existing systems either treat them as separate tasks or just jointly model the two tasks by sharing parameters in an implicit way without explicitly modeling mutual interaction and relation. To address this problem, we propose a Deep Co-Interactive Relation Network (DCR-Net) to explicitly consider the cross-impact and model the interaction between the two tasks by introducing a co-interactive relation layer. In addition, the proposed relation layer can be stacked to gradually capture mutual knowledge with multiple steps of interaction. Especially, we thoroughly study different relation layers and their effects. Experimental results on two public datasets (Mastodon and Dailydialog) show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art joint model by 4.3% and 3.4% in terms of F1 score on dialog act recognition task, 5.7% and 12.4% on sentiment classification respectively. Comprehensive analysis empirically verifies the effectiveness of explicitly modeling the relation between the two tasks and the multi-steps interaction mechanism. Finally, we employ the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) in our framework, which can further boost our performance in both tasks."
Generative Adversarial Zero-Shot Relational Learning for Knowledge Graphs,"Large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) are shown to become more important in current information systems. To expand the coverage of KGs, previous studies on knowledge graph completion need to collect adequate training instances for newly-added relations. In this paper, we consider a novel formulation, zero-shot learning, to free this cumbersome curation. For newly-added relations, we attempt to learn their semantic features from their text descriptions and hence recognize the facts of unseen relations with no examples being seen. For this purpose, we leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to establish the connection between text and knowledge graph domain: The generator learns to generate the reasonable relation embeddings merely with noisy text descriptions. Under this setting, zero-shot learning is naturally converted to a traditional supervised classification task. Empirically, our method is model-agnostic that could be potentially applied to any version of KG embeddings, and consistently yields performance improvements on NELL and Wiki dataset."
Entrainment2Vec: Embedding Entrainment for Multi-Party Dialogues,"Entrainment is the propensity of speakers to begin behaving like one another in conversation. While most entrainment studies have focused on dyadic interactions, researchers have also started to investigate multi-party conversations. In these studies, multi-party entrainment has typically been estimated by averaging the pairs' entrainment values or by averaging individuals' entrainment to the group. While such multi-party measures utilize the strength of dyadic entrainment, they have not yet exploited different aspects of the dynamics of entrainment relations in multi-party groups. In this paper, utilizing an existing pairwise asymmetric entrainment measure, we propose a novel graph-based vector representation of multi-party entrainment that incorporates both strength and dynamics of pairwise entrainment relations. The proposed kernel approach and weakly-supervised representation learning method show promising results at the downstream task of predicting team outcomes. Also, examining the embedding, we found interesting information about the dynamics of the entrainment relations. For example, teams with more influential members have more process conflict."
Towards Scalable Multi-Domain Conversational Agents: The Schema-Guided Dialogue Dataset,"Virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri provide a conversational interface to a large number of services and APIs spanning multiple domains. Such systems need to support an ever-increasing number of services with possibly overlapping functionality. Furthermore, some of these services have little to no training data available. Existing public datasets for task-oriented dialogue do not sufficiently capture these challenges since they cover few domains and assume a single static ontology per domain. In this work, we introduce the the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset, containing over 16k multi-domain conversations spanning 16 domains. Our dataset exceeds the existing task-oriented dialogue corpora in scale, while also highlighting the challenges associated with building large-scale virtual assistants. It provides a challenging testbed for a number of tasks including language understanding, slot filling, dialogue state tracking and response generation. Along the same lines, we present a schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue, in which predictions are made over a dynamic set of intents and slots, provided as input, using their natural language descriptions. This allows a single dialogue system to easily support a large number of services and facilitates simple integration of new services without requiring additional training data. Building upon the proposed paradigm, we release a model for dialogue state tracking capable of zero-shot generalization to new APIs, while remaining competitive in the regular setting."
"Thinking Globally, Acting Locally: Distantly Supervised Global-to-Local Knowledge Selection for Background Based Conversation","Background Based Conversation (BBCs) have been introduced to help conversational systems avoid generating overly generic responses. In a BBC, the conversation is grounded in a knowledge source. A key challenge in BBCs is Knowledge Selection (KS): given a conversational context, try to find the appropriate background knowledge (a text fragment containing related facts or comments, etc.) based on which to generate the next response. Previous work addresses KS by employing attention and/or pointer mechanisms. These mechanisms use a local perspective, i.e., they select a token at a time based solely on the current decoding state. We argue for the adoption of a global perspective, i.e., pre-selecting some text fragments from the background knowledge that could help determine the topic of the next response. We enhance KS in BBCs by introducing a Global-to-Local Knowledge Selection (GLKS) mechanism. Given a conversational context and background knowledge, we first learn a topic transition vector to encode the most likely text fragments to be used in the next response, which is then used to guide the local KS at each decoding timestamp. In order to effectively learn the topic transition vector, we propose a distantly supervised learning schema. Experimental results show that the GLKS model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both automatic and human evaluation. More importantly, GLKS achieves this without requiring any extra annotations, which demonstrates its high degree of scalability."
Multi-Task Learning with Generative Adversarial Training for Multi-Passage Machine Reading Comprehension,"Multi-passage machine reading comprehension (MRC) aims to answer a question by multiple passages. Existing multi-passage MRC approaches have shown that employing passages with and without golden answers (i.e. labeled and unlabeled passages) for model training can improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we present MG-MRC, a novel approach for multi-passage MRC via multi-task learning with generative adversarial training. MG-MRC adopts the extract-then-select framework, where an extractor is first used to predict answer candidates, then a selector is used to choose the final answer. In MG-MRC, we adopt multi-task learning to train the extractor by using both labeled and unlabeled passages. In particular, we use labeled passages to train the extractor by supervised learning, while using unlabeled passages to train the extractor by generative adversarial training, where the extractor is regarded as the generator and a discriminator is introduced to evaluate the generated answer candidates. Moreover, to train the extractor by backpropagation in the generative adversarial training process, we propose a hybrid method which combines boundary-based and content-based extracting methods to produce the answer candidate set and its representation. The experimental results on three open-domain QA datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach."
Probing Natural Language Inference Models through Semantic Fragments,"Do state-of-the-art models for language understanding already have, or can they easily learn, abilities such as boolean coordination, quantification, conditionals, comparatives, and monotonicity reasoning (i.e., reasoning about word substitutions in sentential contexts)? While such phenomena are involved in natural language inference (NLI) and go beyond basic linguistic understanding, it is unclear the extent to which they are captured in existing NLI benchmarks and effectively learned by models. To investigate this, we propose the use of semantic fragments—systematically generated datasets that each target a different semantic phenomenon—for probing, and efficiently improving, such capabilities of linguistic models. This approach to creating challenge datasets allows direct control over the semantic diversity and complexity of the targeted linguistic phenomena, and results in a more precise characterization of a model's linguistic behavior. Our experiments, using a library of 8 such semantic fragments, reveal two remarkable findings: (a) State-of-the-art models, including BERT, that are pre-trained on existing NLI benchmark datasets perform poorly on these new fragments, even though the phenomena probed here are central to the NLI task; (b) On the other hand, with only a few minutes of additional fine-tuning—with a carefully selected learning rate and a novel variation of “inoculation”—a BERT-based model can master all of these logic and monotonicity fragments while retaining its performance on established NLI benchmarks."
Getting Closer to AI Complete Question Answering: A Set of Prerequisite Real Tasks,"The recent explosion in question answering research produced a wealth of both factoid reading comprehension (RC) and commonsense reasoning datasets. Combining them presents a different kind of task: deciding not simply whether information is present in the text, but also whether a confident guess could be made for the missing information. We present QuAIL, the first RC dataset to combine text-based, world knowledge and unanswerable questions, and to provide question type annotation that would enable diagnostics of the reasoning strategies by a given QA system. QuAIL contains 15K multi-choice questions for 800 texts in 4 domains. Crucially, it offers both general and text-specific questions, unlikely to be found in pretraining data. We show that QuAIL poses substantial challenges to the current state-of-the-art systems, with a 30% drop in accuracy compared to the most similar existing dataset."
WinoGrande: An Adversarial Winograd Schema Challenge at Scale,"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011), a benchmark for commonsense reasoning, is a set of 273 expert-crafted pronoun resolution problems originally designed to be unsolvable for statistical models that rely on selectional preferences or word associations. However, recent advances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on variants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have truly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious biases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities of machine commonsense.To investigate this question, we introduce WinoGrande, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design, but adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key steps of the dataset construction consist of (1) a carefully designed crowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a novel AfLite algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word associations to machine-detectable embedding associations. The best state-of-the-art methods on WinoGrande achieve 59.4 – 79.1%, which are ∼15-35% (absolute) below human performance of 94.0%, depending on the amount of the training data allowed (2% – 100% respectively).Furthermore, we establish new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks — WSC (→ 90.1%), DPR (→ 93.1%), COPA(→ 90.6%), KnowRef (→ 85.6%), and Winogender (→ 97.1%). These results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the effectiveness of WinoGrande when used as a resource for transfer learning. On the other hand, they raise a concern that we are likely to be overestimating the true capabilities of machine commonsense across all these benchmarks. We emphasize the importance of algorithmic bias reduction in existing and future benchmarks to mitigate such overestimation."
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Open-Domain Dialog,"Open-domain dialog generation is a challenging problem; maximum likelihood training can lead to repetitive outputs, models have difficulty tracking long-term conversational goals, and training on standard movie or online datasets may lead to the generation of inappropriate, biased, or offensive text. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework that could potentially address these issues, for example by allowing a dialog model to optimize for reducing toxicity and repetitiveness. However, previous approaches which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level, making it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term conversational rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), VHRL, which uses policy gradients to tune the utterance-level embedding of a variational sequence model. This hierarchical approach provides greater flexibility for learning long-term, conversational rewards. We use self-play and RL to optimize for a set of human-centered conversation metrics, and show that our approach provides significant improvements – in terms of both human evaluation and automatic metrics – over state-of-the-art dialog models, including Transformers."
CASIE: Extracting Cybersecurity Event Information from Text,"We present CASIE, a system that extracts information about cybersecurity events from text and populates a semantic model, with the ultimate goal of integration into a knowledge graph of cybersecurity data. It was trained on a new corpus of 1,000 English news articles from 2017–2019 that are labeled with rich, event-based annotations and that covers both cyberattack and vulnerability-related events. Our model defines five event subtypes along with their semantic roles and 20 event-relevant argument types (e.g., file, device, software, money). CASIE uses different deep neural networks approaches with attention and can incorporate rich linguistic features and word embeddings. We have conducted experiments on each component in the event detection pipeline and the results show that each subsystem performs well."
SensEmBERT: Context-Enhanced Sense Embeddings for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation,"Contextual representations of words derived by neural language models have proven to effectively encode the subtle distinctions that might occur between different meanings of the same word. However, these representations are not tied to a semantic network, hence they leave the word meanings implicit and thereby neglect the information that can be derived from the knowledge base itself. In this paper, we propose SensEmBERT, a knowledge-based approach that brings together the expressive power of language modelling and the vast amount of knowledge contained in a semantic network to produce high-quality latent semantic representations of word meanings in multiple languages. Our vectors lie in a space comparable with that of contextualized word embeddings, thus allowing a word occurrence to be easily linked to its meaning by applying a simple nearest neighbour approach.We show that, whilst not relying on manual semantic annotations, SensEmBERT is able to either achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results attained by most of the supervised neural approaches on the English Word Sense Disambiguation task. When scaling to other languages, our representations prove to be equally effective as their English counterpart and outperform the existing state of the art on all the Word Sense Disambiguation multilingual datasets. The embeddings are released in five different languages at http://sensembert.org."
Rare Words: A Major Problem for Contextualized Embeddings and How to Fix it by Attentive Mimicking,"Pretraining deep neural network architectures with a language modeling objective has brought large improvements for many natural language processing tasks. Exemplified by BERT, a recently proposed such architecture, we demonstrate that despite being trained on huge amounts of data, deep language models still struggle to understand rare words. To fix this problem, we adapt Attentive Mimicking, a method that was designed to explicitly learn embeddings for rare words, to deep language models. In order to make this possible, we introduce one-token approximation, a procedure that enables us to use Attentive Mimicking even when the underlying language model uses subword-based tokenization, i.e., it does not assign embeddings to all words. To evaluate our method, we create a novel dataset that tests the ability of language models to capture semantic properties of words without any task-specific fine-tuning. Using this dataset, we show that adding our adapted version of Attentive Mimicking to BERT does substantially improve its understanding of rare words."
Can Embeddings Adequately Represent Medical Terminology? New Large-Scale Medical Term Similarity Datasets Have the Answer!,"A large number of embeddings trained on medical data have emerged, but it remains unclear how well they represent medical terminology, in particular whether the close relationship of semantically similar medical terms is encoded in these embeddings. To date, only small datasets for testing medical term similarity are available, not allowing to draw conclusions about the generalisability of embeddings to the enormous amount of medical terms used by doctors. We present multiple automatically created large-scale medical term similarity datasets and confirm their high quality in an annotation study with doctors. We evaluate state-of-the-art word and contextual embeddings on our new datasets, comparing multiple vector similarity metrics and word vector aggregation techniques. Our results show that current embeddings are limited in their ability to adequately encode medical terms. The novel datasets thus form a challenging new benchmark for the development of medical embeddings able to accurately represent the whole medical terminology."
Interpretable Rumor Detection in Microblogs by Attending to User Interactions,"We address rumor detection by learning to differentiate between the community's response to real and fake claims in microblogs. Existing state-of-the-art models are based on tree models that model conversational trees. However, in social media, a user posting a reply might be replying to the entire thread rather than to a specific user. We propose a post-level attention model (PLAN) to model long distance interactions between tweets with the multi-head attention mechanism in a transformer network. We investigated variants of this model: (1) a structure aware self-attention model (StA-PLAN) that incorporates tree structure information in the transformer network, and (2) a hierarchical token and post-level attention model (StA-HiTPLAN) that learns a sentence representation with token-level self-attention. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate our models on two rumor detection data sets: the PHEME data set as well as the Twitter15 and Twitter16 data sets. We show that our best models outperform current state-of-the-art models for both data sets. Moreover, the attention mechanism allows us to explain rumor detection predictions at both token-level and post-level."
Automatic Fact-Guided Sentence Modification,"Online encyclopediae like Wikipedia contain large amounts of text that need frequent corrections and updates. The new information may contradict existing content in encyclopediae. In this paper, we focus on rewriting such dynamically changing articles. This is a challenging constrained generation task, as the output must be consistent with the new information and fit into the rest of the existing document. To this end, we propose a two-step solution: (1) We identify and remove the contradicting components in a target text for a given claim, using a neutralizing stance model; (2) We expand the remaining text to be consistent with the given claim, using a novel two-encoder sequence-to-sequence model with copy attention. Applied to a Wikipedia fact update dataset, our method successfully generates updated sentences for new claims, achieving the highest SARI score. Furthermore, we demonstrate that generating synthetic data through such rewritten sentences can successfully augment the FEVER fact-checking training dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 13%.1"
Are Noisy Sentences Useless for Distant Supervised Relation Extraction?,"The noisy labeling problem has been one of the major obstacles for distant supervised relation extraction. Existing approaches usually consider that the noisy sentences are useless and will harm the model's performance. Therefore, they mainly alleviate this problem by reducing the influence of noisy sentences, such as applying bag-level selective attention or removing noisy sentences from sentence-bags. However, the underlying cause of the noisy labeling problem is not the lack of useful information, but the missing relation labels. Intuitively, if we can allocate credible labels for noisy sentences, they will be transformed into useful training data and benefit the model's performance. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel method for distant supervised relation extraction, which employs unsupervised deep clustering to generate reliable labels for noisy sentences. Specifically, our model contains three modules: a sentence encoder, a noise detector and a label generator. The sentence encoder is used to obtain feature representations. The noise detector detects noisy sentences from sentence-bags, and the label generator produces high-confidence relation labels for noisy sentences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on a popular benchmark dataset, and can indeed alleviate the noisy labeling problem."
Graph-Based Transformer with Cross-Candidate Verification for Semantic Parsing,"In this paper, we present a graph-based Transformer for semantic parsing. We separate the semantic parsing task into two steps: 1) Use a sequence-to-sequence model to generate the logical form candidates. 2) Design a graph-based Transformer to rerank the candidates. To handle the structure of logical forms, we incorporate graph information to Transformer, and design a cross-candidate verification mechanism to consider all the candidates in the ranking process. Furthermore, we integrate BERT into our model and jointly train the graph-based Transformer and BERT. We conduct experiments on 3 semantic parsing benchmarks, ATIS, JOBS and Task Oriented semantic Parsing dataset (TOP). Experiments show that our graph-based reranking model achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models on the ATIS and JOBS datasets. And on the TOP dataset, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art result."
Q-BERT: Hessian Based Ultra Low Precision Quantization of BERT,"Transformer based architectures have become de-facto models used for a range of Natural Language Processing tasks. In particular, the BERT based models achieved significant accuracy gain for GLUE tasks, CoNLL-03 and SQuAD. However, BERT based models have a prohibitive memory footprint and latency. As a result, deploying BERT based models in resource constrained environments has become a challenging task. In this work, we perform an extensive analysis of fine-tuned BERT models using second order Hessian information, and we use our results to propose a novel method for quantizing BERT models to ultra low precision. In particular, we propose a new group-wise quantization scheme, and we use Hessian-based mix-precision method to compress the model further. We extensively test our proposed method on BERT downstream tasks of SST-2, MNLI, CoNLL-03, and SQuAD. We can achieve comparable performance to baseline with at most 2.3% performance degradation, even with ultra-low precision quantization down to 2 bits, corresponding up to 13× compression of the model parameters, and up to 4× compression of the embedding table as well as activations. Among all tasks, we observed the highest performance loss for BERT fine-tuned on SQuAD. By probing into the Hessian based analysis as well as visualization, we show that this is related to the fact that current training/fine-tuning strategy of BERT does not converge for SQuAD."
On the Generation of Medical Question-Answer Pairs,"Question answering (QA) has achieved promising progress recently. However, answering a question in real-world scenarios like the medical domain is still challenging, due to the requirement of external knowledge and the insufficient quantity of high-quality training data. In the light of these challenges, we study the task of generating medical QA pairs in this paper. With the insight that each medical question can be considered as a sample from the latent distribution of questions given answers, we propose an automated medical QA pair generation framework, consisting of an unsupervised key phrase detector that explores unstructured material for validity, and a generator that involves a multi-pass decoder to integrate structural knowledge for diversity. A series of experiments have been conducted on a real-world dataset collected from the National Medical Licensing Examination of China. Both automatic evaluation and human annotation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further investigation shows that, by incorporating the generated QA pairs for training, significant improvement in terms of accuracy can be achieved for the examination QA system. 1"
IntroVNMT: An Introspective Model for Variational Neural Machine Translation,"We propose a novel introspective model for variational neural machine translation (IntroVNMT) in this paper, inspired by the recent successful application of introspective variational autoencoder (IntroVAE) in high quality image synthesis. Different from the vanilla variational NMT model, IntroVNMT is capable of improving itself introspectively by evaluating the quality of the generated target sentences according to the high-level latent variables of the real and generated target sentences. As a consequence of introspective training, the proposed model is able to discriminate between the generated and real sentences of the target language via the latent variables generated by the encoder of the model. In this way, IntroVNMT is able to generate more realistic target sentences in practice. In the meantime, IntroVNMT inherits the advantages of the variational autoencoders (VAEs), and the model training process is more stable than the generative adversarial network (GAN) based models. Experimental results on different translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve significant improvements over the vanilla variational NMT model."
Understanding Medical Conversations with Scattered Keyword Attention and Weak Supervision from Responses,"In this work, we consider the medical slot filling problem, i.e., the problem of converting medical queries into structured representations which is a challenging task. We analyze the effectiveness of two points: scattered keywords in user utterances and weak supervision with responses. We approach the medical slot filling as a multi-label classification problem with label-embedding attentive model to pay more attention to scattered medical keywords and learn the classification models by weak-supervision from responses. To evaluate the approaches, we annotate a medical slot filling data and collect a large scale unlabeled data. The experiments demonstrate that these two points are promising to improve the task."
Latent-Variable Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation with Deterministic Inference Using a Delta Posterior,"Although neural machine translation models reached high translation quality, the autoregressive nature makes inference difficult to parallelize and leads to high translation latency. Inspired by recent refinement-based approaches, we propose LaNMT, a latent-variable non-autoregressive model with continuous latent variables and deterministic inference procedure. In contrast to existing approaches, we use a deterministic inference algorithm to find the target sequence that maximizes the lowerbound to the log-probability. During inference, the length of translation automatically adapts itself. Our experiments show that the lowerbound can be greatly increased by running the inference algorithm, resulting in significantly improved translation quality. Our proposed model closes the performance gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive approaches on ASPEC Ja-En dataset with 8.6x faster decoding. On WMT'14 En-De dataset, our model narrows the gap with autoregressive baseline to 2.0 BLEU points with 12.5x speedup. By decoding multiple initial latent variables in parallel and rescore using a teacher model, the proposed model further brings the gap down to 1.0 BLEU point on WMT'14 En-De task with 6.8x speedup."
Evaluating the Cross-Lingual Effectiveness of Massively Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"The recently proposed massively multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) system has been shown to be capable of translating over 100 languages to and from English within a single model (Aharoni, Johnson, and Firat 2019). Its improved translation performance on low resource languages hints at potential cross-lingual transfer capability for downstream tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the cross-lingual effectiveness of representations from the encoder of a massively multilingual NMT model on 5 downstream classification and sequence labeling tasks covering a diverse set of over 50 languages. We compare against a strong baseline, multilingual BERT (mBERT) (Devlin et al. 2018), in different cross-lingual transfer learning scenarios and show gains in zero-shot transfer in 4 out of these 5 tasks."
Low Resource Sequence Tagging with Weak Labels,"Current methods for sequence tagging depend on large quantities of domain-specific training data, limiting their use in new, user-defined tasks with few or no annotations. While crowdsourcing can be a cheap source of labels, it often introduces errors that degrade the performance of models trained on such crowdsourced data. Another solution is to use transfer learning to tackle low resource sequence labelling, but current approaches rely heavily on similar high resource datasets in different languages. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method using Bayesian sequence combination to exploit pre-trained models and unreliable crowdsourced data that does not require high resource data in a different language. Our method boosts performance by learning the relationship between each labeller and the target task and trains a sequence labeller on the target domain with little or no gold-standard data. We apply our approach to labelling diagnostic classes in medical and educational case studies, showing that the model achieves strong performance though zero-shot transfer learning and is more effective than alternative ensemble methods. Using NER and information extraction tasks, we show how our approach can train a model directly from crowdsourced labels, outperforming pipeline approaches that first aggregate the crowdsourced data, then train on the aggregated labels."
Modelling Form-Meaning Systematicity with Linguistic and Visual Features,"Several studies in linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) pointed out systematic correspondences between word form and meaning in language. A prominent example of such systematicity is iconicity, which occurs when the form of a word is motivated by some perceptual (e.g. visual) aspect of its referent. However, the existing data-driven approaches to form-meaning systematicity modelled word meanings relying on information extracted from textual data alone. In this paper, we investigate to what extent our visual experience explains some of the form-meaning systematicity found in language. We construct word meaning representations from linguistic as well as visual data and analyze the structure and significance of form-meaning systematicity found in English using these models. Our findings corroborate the existence of form-meaning systematicity and show that this systematicity is concentrated in localized clusters. Furthermore, applying a multimodal approach allows us to identify new patterns of systematicity that have not been previously identified with the text-based models."
Generating Persona Consistent Dialogues by Exploiting Natural Language Inference,"Consistency is one of the major challenges faced by dialogue agents. A human-like dialogue agent should not only respond naturally, but also maintain a consistent persona. In this paper, we exploit the advantages of natural language inference (NLI) technique to address the issue of generating persona consistent dialogues. Different from existing work that re-ranks the retrieved responses through an NLI model, we cast the task as a reinforcement learning problem and propose to exploit the NLI signals from response-persona pairs as rewards for the process of dialogue generation. Specifically, our generator employs an attention-based encoder-decoder to generate persona-based responses. Our evaluator consists of two components: an adversarially trained naturalness module and an NLI based consistency module. Moreover, we use another well-performed NLI model in the evaluation of persona-consistency. Experimental results on both human and automatic metrics, including the model-based consistency evaluation, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms strong generative baselines, especially in the persona-consistency of generated responses."
Alignment-Enhanced Transformer for Constraining NMT with Pre-Specified Translations,"We investigate the task of constraining NMT with pre-specified translations, which has practical significance for a number of research and industrial applications. Existing works impose pre-specified translations as lexical constraints during decoding, which are based on word alignments derived from target-to-source attention weights. However, multiple recent studies have found that word alignment derived from generic attention heads in the Transformer is unreliable. We address this problem by introducing a dedicated head in the multi-head Transformer architecture to capture external supervision signals. Results on five language pairs show that our method is highly effective in constraining NMT with pre-specified translations, consistently outperforming previous methods in translation quality."
Joint Parsing and Generation for Abstractive Summarization,"Sentences produced by abstractive summarization systems can be ungrammatical and fail to preserve the original meanings, despite being locally fluent. In this paper we propose to remedy this problem by jointly generating a sentence and its syntactic dependency parse while performing abstraction. If generating a word can introduce an erroneous relation to the summary, the behavior must be discouraged. The proposed method thus holds promise for producing grammatical sentences and encouraging the summary to stay true-to-original. Our contributions of this work are twofold. First, we present a novel neural architecture for abstractive summarization that combines a sequential decoder with a tree-based decoder in a synchronized manner to generate a summary sentence and its syntactic parse. Secondly, we describe a novel human evaluation protocol to assess if, and to what extent, a summary remains true to its original meanings. We evaluate our method on a number of summarization datasets and demonstrate competitive results against strong baselines."
Controlling the Amount of Verbatim Copying in Abstractive Summarization,"An abstract must not change the meaning of the original text. A single most effective way to achieve that is to increase the amount of copying while still allowing for text abstraction. Human editors can usually exercise control over copying, resulting in summaries that are more extractive than abstractive, or vice versa. However, it remains poorly understood whether modern neural abstractive summarizers can provide the same flexibility, i.e., learning from single reference summaries to generate multiple summary hypotheses with varying degrees of copying. In this paper, we present a neural summarization model that, by learning from single human abstracts, can produce a broad spectrum of summaries ranging from purely extractive to highly generative ones. We frame the task of summarization as language modeling and exploit alternative mechanisms to generate summary hypotheses. Our method allows for control over copying during both training and decoding stages of a neural summarization model. Through extensive experiments we illustrate the significance of our proposed method on controlling the amount of verbatim copying and achieve competitive results over strong baselines. Our analysis further reveals interesting and unobvious facts."
Attractive or Faithful? Popularity-Reinforced Learning for Inspired Headline Generation,"With the rapid proliferation of online media sources and published news, headlines have become increasingly important for attracting readers to news articles, since users may be overwhelmed with the massive information. In this paper, we generate inspired headlines that preserve the nature of news articles and catch the eye of the reader simultaneously. The task of inspired headline generation can be viewed as a specific form of Headline Generation (HG) task, with the emphasis on creating an attractive headline from a given news article. To generate inspired headlines, we propose a novel framework called POpularity-Reinforced Learning for inspired Headline Generation (PORL-HG). PORL-HG exploits the extractive-abstractive architecture with 1) Popular Topic Attention (PTA) for guiding the extractor to select the attractive sentence from the article and 2) a popularity predictor for guiding the abstractor to rewrite the attractive sentence. Moreover, since the sentence selection of the extractor is not differentiable, techniques of reinforcement learning (RL) are utilized to bridge the gap with rewards obtained from a popularity score predictor. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that the proposed PORL-HG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art headline generation models in terms of attractiveness evaluated by both human (71.03%) and the predictor (at least 27.60%), while the faithfulness of PORL-HG is also comparable to the state-of-the-art generation model."
Assessing the Benchmarking Capacity of Machine Reading Comprehension Datasets,"Existing analysis work in machine reading comprehension (MRC) is largely concerned with evaluating the capabilities of systems. However, the capabilities of datasets are not assessed for benchmarking language understanding precisely. We propose a semi-automated, ablation-based methodology for this challenge; By checking whether questions can be solved even after removing features associated with a skill requisite for language understanding, we evaluate to what degree the questions do not require the skill. Experiments on 10 datasets (e.g., CoQA, SQuAD v2.0, and RACE) with a strong baseline model show that, for example, the relative scores of the baseline model provided with content words only and with shuffled sentence words in the context are on average 89.2% and 78.5% of the original scores, respectively. These results suggest that most of the questions already answered correctly by the model do not necessarily require grammatical and complex reasoning. For precise benchmarking, MRC datasets will need to take extra care in their design to ensure that questions can correctly evaluate the intended skills."
Relation Extraction with Convolutional Network over Learnable Syntax-Transport Graph,"A large majority of approaches have been proposed to leverage the dependency tree in the relation classification task. Recent works have focused on pruning irrelevant information from the dependency tree. The state-of-the-art Attention Guided Graph Convolutional Networks (AGGCNs) transforms the dependency tree into a weighted-graph to distinguish the relevance of nodes and edges for relation classification. However, in their approach, the graph is fully connected, which destroys the structure information of the original dependency tree. How to effectively make use of relevant information while ignoring irrelevant information from the dependency trees remains a challenge in the relation classification task. In this work, we learn to transform the dependency tree into a weighted graph by considering the syntax dependencies of the connected nodes and persisting the structure of the original dependency tree. We refer to this graph as a syntax-transport graph. We further propose a learnable syntax-transport attention graph convolutional network (LST-AGCN) which operates on the syntax-transport graph directly to distill the final representation which is sufficient for classification. Experiments on Semeval-2010 Task 8 and Tacred show our approach outperforms previous methods."
Learning Sparse Sharing Architectures for Multiple Tasks,"Most existing deep multi-task learning models are based on parameter sharing, such as hard sharing, hierarchical sharing, and soft sharing. How choosing a suitable sharing mechanism depends on the relations among the tasks, which is not easy since it is difficult to understand the underlying shared factors among these tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter sharing mechanism, named Sparse Sharing. Given multiple tasks, our approach automatically finds a sparse sharing structure. We start with an over-parameterized base network, from which each task extracts a subnetwork. The subnetworks of multiple tasks are partially overlapped and trained in parallel. We show that both hard sharing and hierarchical sharing can be formulated as particular instances of the sparse sharing framework. We conduct extensive experiments on three sequence labeling tasks. Compared with single-task models and three typical multi-task learning baselines, our proposed approach achieves consistent improvement while requiring fewer parameters."
History-Adaption Knowledge Incorporation Mechanism for Multi-Turn Dialogue System,"Keeping the conversation consistent and avoiding its repetition are two key factors to construct an intelligent multi-turn knowledge-grounded dialogue system. Although some works tend to combine history with external knowledge such as personal background information to boost dialogue quality, they are prone to ignore the fact that incorporating the same knowledge multiple times into the conversation leads to repetition. The main reason is the lack of effective control over the use of knowledge on the conversation level. So we design a history-adaption knowledge incorporation mechanism to build an effective multi-turn dialogue model. Our proposed model addresses repetition by recurrently updating the knowledge from the conversation level and progressively incorporating it into the history step-by-step. And the knowledge-grounded history representation also enhances the conversation consistency. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms several retrieval-based models on some benchmark datasets. The human evaluation demonstrates that our model can maintain conversation consistent and reduce conversation repetition."
SPARQA: Skeleton-Based Semantic Parsing for Complex Questions over Knowledge Bases,"Semantic parsing transforms a natural language question into a formal query over a knowledge base. Many existing methods rely on syntactic parsing like dependencies. However, the accuracy of producing such expressive formalisms is not satisfying on long complex questions. In this paper, we propose a novel skeleton grammar to represent the high-level structure of a complex question. This dedicated coarse-grained formalism with a BERT-based parsing algorithm helps to improve the accuracy of the downstream fine-grained semantic parsing. Besides, to align the structure of a question with the structure of a knowledge base, our multi-strategy method combines sentence-level and word-level semantics. Our approach shows promising performance on several datasets."
Neural Semantic Parsing in Low-Resource Settings with Back-Translation and Meta-Learning,"Neural semantic parsing has achieved impressive results in recent years, yet its success relies on the availability of large amounts of supervised data. Our goal is to learn a neural semantic parser when only prior knowledge about a limited number of simple rules is available, without access to either annotated programs or execution results. Our approach is initialized by rules, and improved in a back-translation paradigm using generated question-program pairs from the semantic parser and the question generator. A phrase table with frequent mapping patterns is automatically derived, also updated as training progresses, to measure the quality of generated instances. We train the model with model-agnostic meta-learning to guarantee the accuracy and stability on examples covered by rules, and meanwhile acquire the versatility to generalize well on examples uncovered by rules. Results on three benchmark datasets with different domains and programs show that our approach incrementally improves the accuracy. On WikiSQL, our best model is comparable to the state-of-the-art system learned from denotations."
ERNIE 2.0: A Continual Pre-Training Framework for Language Understanding,"Recently pre-trained models have achieved state-of-the-art results in various language understanding tasks. Current pre-training procedures usually focus on training the model with several simple tasks to grasp the co-occurrence of words or sentences. However, besides co-occurring information, there exists other valuable lexical, syntactic and semantic information in training corpora, such as named entities, semantic closeness and discourse relations. In order to extract the lexical, syntactic and semantic information from training corpora, we propose a continual pre-training framework named ERNIE 2.0 which incrementally builds pre-training tasks and then learn pre-trained models on these constructed tasks via continual multi-task learning. Based on this framework, we construct several tasks and train the ERNIE 2.0 model to capture lexical, syntactic and semantic aspects of information in the training data. Experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE 2.0 model outperforms BERT and XLNet on 16 tasks including English tasks on GLUE benchmarks and several similar tasks in Chinese. The source codes and pre-trained models have been released at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE."
Generating Diverse Translation by Manipulating Multi-Head Attention,"Transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017) has been widely used in machine translation tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we report an interesting phenomenon in its encoder-decoder multi-head attention: different attention heads of the final decoder layer align to different word translation candidates. We empirically verify this discovery and propose a method to generate diverse translations by manipulating heads. Furthermore, we make use of these diverse translations with the back-translation technique for better data augmentation. Experiment results show that our method generates diverse translations without a severe drop in translation quality. Experiments also show that back-translation with these diverse translations could bring a significant improvement in performance on translation tasks. An auxiliary experiment of conversation response generation task proves the effect of diversity as well."
TreeGen: A Tree-Based Transformer Architecture for Code Generation,"A code generation system generates programming language code based on an input natural language description. State-of-the-art approaches rely on neural networks for code generation. However, these code generators suffer from two problems. One is the long dependency problem, where a code element often depends on another far-away code element. A variable reference, for example, depends on its definition, which may appear quite a few lines before. The other problem is structure modeling, as programs contain rich structural information. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based neural architecture, TreeGen, for code generation. TreeGen uses the attention mechanism of Transformers to alleviate the long-dependency problem, and introduces a novel AST reader (encoder) to incorporate grammar rules and AST structures into the network. We evaluated TreeGen on a Python benchmark, HearthStone, and two semantic parsing benchmarks, ATIS and GEO. TreeGen outperformed the previous state-of-the-art approach by 4.5 percentage points on HearthStone, and achieved the best accuracy among neural network-based approaches on ATIS (89.1%) and GEO (89.6%). We also conducted an ablation test to better understand each component of our model."
"Learning Relationships between Text, Audio, and Video via Deep Canonical Correlation for Multimodal Language Analysis","Multimodal language analysis often considers relationships between features based on text and those based on acoustical and visual properties. Text features typically outperform non-text features in sentiment analysis or emotion recognition tasks in part because the text features are derived from advanced language models or word embeddings trained on massive data sources while audio and video features are human-engineered and comparatively underdeveloped. Given that the text, audio, and video are describing the same utterance in different ways, we hypothesize that the multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition can be improved by learning (hidden) correlations between features extracted from the outer product of text and audio (we call this text-based audio) and analogous text-based video. This paper proposes a novel model, the Interaction Canonical Correlation Network (ICCN), to learn such multimodal embeddings. ICCN learns correlations between all three modes via deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) and the proposed embeddings are then tested on several benchmark datasets and against other state-of-the-art multimodal embedding algorithms. Empirical results and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of ICCN in capturing useful information from all three views."
Distributed Representations for Arithmetic Word Problems,"We consider the task of learning distributed representations for arithmetic word problems. We outline the characteristics of the domain of arithmetic word problems that make generic text embedding methods inadequate, necessitating a specialized representation learning method to facilitate the task of retrieval across a wide range of use cases within online learning platforms. Our contribution is two-fold; first, we propose several 'operators' that distil knowledge of the domain of arithmetic word problems and schemas into word problem transformations. Second, we propose a novel neural architecture that combines LSTMs with graph convolutional networks to leverage word problems and their operator-transformed versions to learn distributed representations for word problems. While our target is to ensure that the distributed representations are schema-aligned, we do not make use of schema labels in the learning process, thus yielding an unsupervised representation learning method. Through an evaluation on retrieval over a publicly available corpus of word problems, we illustrate that our framework is able to consistently improve upon contemporary generic text embeddings in terms of schema-alignment."
Adapting Language Models for Non-Parallel Author-Stylized Rewriting,"Given the recent progress in language modeling using Transformer-based neural models and an active interest in generating stylized text, we present an approach to leverage the generalization capabilities of a language model to rewrite an input text in a target author's style. Our proposed approach adapts a pre-trained language model to generate author-stylized text by fine-tuning on the author-specific corpus using a denoising autoencoder (DAE) loss in a cascaded encoder-decoder framework. Optimizing over DAE loss allows our model to learn the nuances of an author's style without relying on parallel data, which has been a severe limitation of the previous related works in this space. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we propose a linguistically-motivated framework to quantify stylistic alignment of the generated text to the target author at lexical, syntactic and surface levels. The evaluation framework is both interpretable as it leads to several insights about the model, and self-contained as it does not rely on external classifiers, e.g. sentiment or formality classifiers. Qualitative and quantitative assessment indicates that the proposed approach rewrites the input text with better alignment to the target style while preserving the original content better than state-of-the-art baselines."
Boundary Enhanced Neural Span Classification for Nested Named Entity Recognition,"Named entity recognition (NER) is a well-studied task in natural language processing. However, the widely-used sequence labeling framework is usually difficult to detect entities with nested structures. The span-based method that can easily detect nested entities in different subsequences is naturally suitable for the nested NER problem. However, previous span-based methods have two main issues. First, classifying all subsequences is computationally expensive and very inefficient at inference. Second, the span-based methods mainly focus on learning span representations but lack of explicit boundary supervision. To tackle the above two issues, we propose a boundary enhanced neural span classification model. In addition to classifying the span, we propose incorporating an additional boundary detection task to predict those words that are boundaries of entities. The two tasks are jointly trained under a multitask learning framework, which enhances the span representation with additional boundary supervision. In addition, the boundary detection model has the ability to generate high-quality candidate spans, which greatly reduces the time complexity during inference. Experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods and achieves 85.3, 83.9, and 78.3 scores in terms of F1 on the ACE2004, ACE2005, and GENIA datasets, respectively."
Multi-Label Patent Categorization with Non-Local Attention-Based Graph Convolutional Network,"Patent categorization, which is to assign multiple International Patent Classification (IPC) codes to a patent document, relies heavily on expert efforts, as it requires substantial domain knowledge. When formulated as a multi-label text classification (MTC) problem, it draws two challenges to existing models: one is to learn effective document representations from text content; the other is to model the cross-section behavior of label set. In this work, we propose a label attention model based on graph convolutional network. It jointly learns the document-word associations and word-word co-occurrences to generate rich semantic embeddings of documents. It employs a non-local attention mechanism to learn label representations in the same space of document representations for multi-label classification. On a large CIRCA patent database, we evaluate the performance of our model and as many as seven competitive baselines. We find that our model outperforms all those prior state of the art by a large margin and achieves high performance on P@k and nDCG@k."
Capturing Sentence Relations for Answer Sentence Selection with Multi-Perspective Graph Encoding,"This paper focuses on the answer sentence selection task. Unlike previous work, which only models the relation between the question and each candidate sentence, we propose Multi-Perspective Graph Encoder (MPGE) to take the relations among the candidate sentences into account and capture the relations from multiple perspectives. By utilizing MPGE as a module, we construct two answer sentence selection models which are based on traditional representation and pre-trained representation, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, WikiQA and SQuAD. The results show that the proposed MPGE is effective for both types of representation. Moreover, the overall performance of our proposed model surpasses the state-of-the-art on both datasets. Additionally, we further validate the robustness of our method by the adversarial examples of AddSent and AddOneSent."
Image Enhanced Event Detection in News Articles,"Event detection is a crucial and challenging sub-task of event extraction, which suffers from a severe ambiguity issue of trigger words. Existing works mainly focus on using textual context information, while there naturally exist many images accompanied by news articles that are yet to be explored. We believe that images not only reflect the core events of the text, but are also helpful for the disambiguation of trigger words. In this paper, we first contribute an image dataset supplement to ED benchmarks (i.e., ACE2005) for training and evaluation. We then propose a novel Dual Recurrent Multimodal Model, DRMM, to conduct deep interactions between images and sentences for modality features aggregation. DRMM utilizes pre-trained BERT and ResNet to encode sentences and images, and employs an alternating dual attention to select informative features for mutual enhancements. Our superior performance compared to six state-of-art baselines as well as further ablation studies demonstrate the significance of image modality and effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The code and image dataset are avaliable at https://github.com/shuaiwa16/image-enhanced-event-extraction."
Fine-Grained Argument Unit Recognition and Classification,"Prior work has commonly defined argument retrieval from heterogeneous document collections as a sentence-level classification task. Consequently, argument retrieval suffers both from low recall and from sentence segmentation errors making it difficult for humans and machines to consume the arguments. In this work, we argue that the task should be performed on a more fine-grained level of sequence labeling. For this, we define the task as Argument Unit Recognition and Classification (AURC). We present a dataset of arguments from heterogeneous sources annotated as spans of tokens within a sentence, as well as with a corresponding stance. We show that and how such difficult argument annotations can be effectively collected through crowdsourcing with high inter-annotator agreement. The new benchmark, AURC-8, contains up to 15% more arguments per topic as compared to annotations on the sentence level. We identify a number of methods targeted at AURC sequence labeling, achieving close to human performance on known domains. Further analysis also reveals that, contrary to previous approaches, our methods are more robust against sentence segmentation errors. We publicly release our code and the AURC-8 dataset.1"
Sentence Generation for Entity Description with Content-Plan Attention,"We study neural data-to-text generation. Specifically, we consider a target entity that is associated with a set of attributes. We aim to generate a sentence to describe the target entity. Previous studies use encoder-decoder frameworks where the encoder treats the input as a linear sequence and uses LSTM to encode the sequence. However, linearizing a set of attributes may not yield the proper order of the attributes, and hence leads the encoder to produce an improper context to generate a description. To handle disordered input, recent studies propose two-stage neural models that use pointer networks to generate a content-plan (i.e., content-planner) and use the content-plan as input for an encoder-decoder model (i.e., text generator). However, in two-stage models, the content-planner may yield an incomplete content-plan, due to missing one or more salient attributes in the generated content-plan. This will in turn cause the text generator to generate an incomplete description. To address these problems, we propose a novel attention model that exploits content-plan to highlight salient attributes in a proper order. The challenge of integrating a content-plan in the attention model of an encoder-decoder framework is to align the content-plan and the generated description. We handle this problem by devising a coverage mechanism to track the extent to which the content-plan is exposed in the previous decoding time-step, and hence it helps our proposed attention model select the attributes to be mentioned in the description in a proper order. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 3% and 5% in terms of BLEU score on two real-world datasets, respectively."
Capturing Greater Context for Question Generation,"Automatic question generation can benefit many applications ranging from dialogue systems to reading comprehension. While questions are often asked with respect to long documents, there are many challenges with modeling such long documents. Many existing techniques generate questions by effectively looking at one sentence at a time, leading to questions that are easy and not reflective of the human process of question generation. Our goal is to incorporate interactions across multiple sentences to generate realistic questions for long documents. In order to link a broad document context to the target answer, we represent the relevant context via a multi-stage attention mechanism, which forms the foundation of a sequence to sequence model. We outperform state-of-the-art methods on question generation on three question-answering datasets - SQuAD, MS MARCO and NewsQA. 1"
"Select, Answer and Explain: Interpretable Multi-Hop Reading Comprehension over Multiple Documents","Interpretable multi-hop reading comprehension (RC) over multiple documents is a challenging problem because it demands reasoning over multiple information sources and explaining the answer prediction by providing supporting evidences. In this paper, we propose an effective and interpretable Select, Answer and Explain (SAE) system to solve the multi-document RC problem. Our system first filters out answer-unrelated documents and thus reduce the amount of distraction information. This is achieved by a document classifier trained with a novel pairwise learning-to-rank loss. The selected answer-related documents are then input to a model to jointly predict the answer and supporting sentences. The model is optimized with a multi-task learning objective on both token level for answer prediction and sentence level for supporting sentences prediction, together with an attention-based interaction between these two tasks. Evaluated on HotpotQA, a challenging multi-hop RC data set, the proposed SAE system achieves top competitive performance in distractor setting compared to other existing systems on the leaderboard."
An Annotated Corpus of Reference Resolution for Interpreting Common Grounding,"Common grounding is the process of creating, repairing and updating mutual understandings, which is a fundamental aspect of natural language conversation. However, interpreting the process of common grounding is a challenging task, especially under continuous and partially-observable context where complex ambiguity, uncertainty, partial understandings and misunderstandings are introduced. Interpretation becomes even more challenging when we deal with dialogue systems which still have limited capability of natural language understanding and generation. To address this problem, we consider reference resolution as the central subtask of common grounding and propose a new resource to study its intermediate process. Based on a simple and general annotation schema, we collected a total of 40,172 referring expressions in 5,191 dialogues curated from an existing corpus, along with multiple judgements of referent interpretations. We show that our annotation is highly reliable, captures the complexity of common grounding through a natural degree of reasonable disagreements, and allows for more detailed and quantitative analyses of common grounding strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of our annotation for interpreting, analyzing and improving common grounding in baseline dialogue systems."
A Comparison of Architectures and Pretraining Methods for Contextualized Multilingual Word Embeddings,"The lack of annotated data in many languages is a well-known challenge within the field of multilingual natural language processing (NLP). Therefore, many recent studies focus on zero-shot transfer learning and joint training across languages to overcome data scarcity for low-resource languages. In this work we (i) perform a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art multilingual word and sentence encoders on the tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and part of speech (POS) tagging; and (ii) propose a new method for creating multilingual contextualized word embeddings, compare it to multiple baselines and show that it performs at or above state-of-the-art level in zero-shot transfer settings. Finally, we show that our method allows for better knowledge sharing across languages in a joint training setting."
A Joint Model for Definition Extraction with Syntactic Connection and Semantic Consistency,"Definition Extraction (DE) is one of the well-known topics in Information Extraction that aims to identify terms and their corresponding definitions in unstructured texts. This task can be formalized either as a sentence classification task (i.e., containing term-definition pairs or not) or a sequential labeling task (i.e., identifying the boundaries of the terms and definitions). The previous works for DE have only focused on one of the two approaches, failing to model the inter-dependencies between the two tasks. In this work, we propose a novel model for DE that simultaneously performs the two tasks in a single framework to benefit from their inter-dependencies. Our model features deep learning architectures to exploit the global structures of the input sentences as well as the semantic consistencies between the terms and the definitions, thereby improving the quality of the representation vectors for DE. Besides the joint inference between sentence classification and sequential labeling, the proposed model is fundamentally different from the prior work for DE in that the prior work has only employed the local structures of the input sentences (i.e., word-to-word relations), and not yet considered the semantic consistencies between terms and definitions. In order to implement these novel ideas, our model presents a multi-task learning framework that employs graph convolutional neural networks and predicts the dependency paths between the terms and the definitions. We also seek to enforce the consistency between the representations of the terms and definitions both globally (i.e., increasing semantic consistency between the representations of the entire sentences and the terms/definitions) and locally (i.e., promoting the similarity between the representations of the terms and the definitions). The extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.1"
Multi-View Consistency for Relation Extraction via Mutual Information and Structure Prediction,"Relation Extraction (RE) is one of the fundamental tasks in Information Extraction. The goal of this task is to find the semantic relations between entity mentions in text. It has been shown in many previous work that the structure of the sentences (i.e., dependency trees) can provide important information/features for the RE models. However, the common limitation of the previous work on RE is the reliance on some external parsers to obtain the syntactic trees for the sentence structures. On the one hand, it is not guaranteed that the independent external parsers can offer the optimal sentence structures for RE and the customized structures for RE might help to further improve the performance. On the other hand, the quality of the external parsers might suffer when applied to different domains, thus also affecting the performance of the RE models on such domains. In order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel method for RE that simultaneously induces the structures and predicts the relations for the input sentences, thus avoiding the external parsers and potentially leading to better sentence structures for RE. Our general strategy to learn the RE-specific structures is to apply two different methods to infer the structures for the input sentences (i.e., two views). We then introduce several mechanisms to encourage the structure and semantic consistencies between these two views so the effective structure and semantic representations for RE can emerge. We perform extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 and SemEval 2010 datasets to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance on such datasets."
Parsing as Pretraining,"Recent analyses suggest that encoders pretrained for language modeling capture certain morpho-syntactic structure. However, probing frameworks for word vectors still do not report results on standard setups such as constituent and dependency parsing. This paper addresses this problem and does full parsing (on English) relying only on pretraining architectures – and no decoding. We first cast constituent and dependency parsing as sequence tagging. We then use a single feed-forward layer to directly map word vectors to labels that encode a linearized tree. This is used to: (i) see how far we can reach on syntax modelling with just pretrained encoders, and (ii) shed some light about the syntax-sensitivity of different word vectors (by freezing the weights of the pretraining network during training). For evaluation, we use bracketing F1-score and las, and analyze in-depth differences across representations for span lengths and dependency displacements. The overall results surpass existing sequence tagging parsers on the ptb (93.5%) and end-to-end en-ewt ud (78.8%)."
Target-Aspect-Sentiment Joint Detection for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to detect the targets (which are composed by continuous words), aspects and sentiment polarities in text. Published datasets from SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 reveal that a sentiment polarity depends on both the target and the aspect. However, most of the existing methods consider predicting sentiment polarities from either targets or aspects but not from both, thus they easily make wrong predictions on sentiment polarities. In particular, where the target is implicit, i.e., it does not appear in the given text, the methods predicting sentiment polarities from targets do not work. To tackle these limitations in ABSA, this paper proposes a novel method for target-aspect-sentiment joint detection. It relies on a pre-trained language model and can capture the dependence on both targets and aspects for sentiment prediction. Experimental results on the SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016 restaurant datasets show that the proposed method achieves a high performance in detecting target-aspect-sentiment triples even for the implicit target cases; moreover, it even outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for those subtasks of target-aspect-sentiment detection that they are competent to."
Unsupervised Neural Dialect Translation with Commonality and Diversity Modeling,"As a special machine translation task, dialect translation has two main characteristics: 1) lack of parallel training corpus; and 2) possessing similar grammar between two sides of the translation. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the commonality and diversity between dialects thus to build unsupervised translation models merely accessing to monolingual data. Specifically, we leverage pivot-private embedding, layer coordination, as well as parameter sharing to sufficiently model commonality and diversity among source and target, ranging from lexical, through syntactic, to semantic levels. In order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed models, we collect 20 million monolingual corpus for each of Mandarin and Cantonese, which are official language and the most widely used dialect in China. Experimental results reveal that our methods outperform rule-based simplified and traditional Chinese conversion and conventional unsupervised translation models over 12 BLEU scores."
Neural Question Generation with Answer Pivot,"Neural question generation (NQG) is the task of generating questions from the given context with deep neural networks. Previous answer-aware NQG methods suffer from the problem that the generated answers are focusing on entity and most of the questions are trivial to be answered. The answer-agnostic NQG methods reduce the bias towards named entities and increasing the model's degrees of freedom, but sometimes result in generating unanswerable questions which are not valuable for the subsequent machine reading comprehension system. In this paper, we treat the answers as the hidden pivot for question generation and combine the question generation and answer selection process in a joint model. We achieve the state-of-the-art result on the SQuAD dataset according to automatic metric and human evaluation."
ReCO: A Large Scale Chinese Reading Comprehension Dataset on Opinion,"This paper presents the ReCO, a human-curated Chinese Reading Comprehension dataset on Opinion. The questions in ReCO are opinion based queries issued to commercial search engine. The passages are provided by the crowdworkers who extract the support snippet from the retrieved documents. Finally, an abstractive yes/no/uncertain answer was given by the crowdworkers. The release of ReCO consists of 300k questions that to our knowledge is the largest in Chinese reading comprehension. A prominent characteristic of ReCO is that in addition to the original context paragraph, we also provided the support evidence that could be directly used to answer the question. Quality analysis demonstrates the challenge of ReCO that it requires various types of reasoning skills such as causal inference, logical reasoning, etc. Current QA models that perform very well on many question answering problems, such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018), only achieves 77% accuracy on this dataset, a large margin behind humans nearly 92% performance, indicating ReCO present a good challenge for machine reading comprehension. The codes, dataset and leaderboard will be freely available at https://github.com/benywon/ReCO."
Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords,"Almost all existing machine translation models are built on top of character-based vocabularies: characters, subwords or words. Rare characters from noisy text or character-rich languages such as Japanese and Chinese however can unnecessarily take up vocabulary slots and limit its compactness. Representing text at the level of bytes and using the 256 byte set as vocabulary is a potential solution to this issue. High computational cost has however prevented it from being widely deployed or used in practice. In this paper, we investigate byte-level subwords, specifically byte-level BPE (BBPE), which is compacter than character vocabulary and has no out-of-vocabulary tokens, but is more efficient than using pure bytes only is. We claim that contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a convolutional or recurrent layer. Our experiments show that BBPE has comparable performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE. In the multilingual setting, BBPE maximizes vocabulary sharing across many languages and achieves better translation quality. Moreover, we show that BBPE enables transferring models between languages with non-overlapping character sets."
Bridging the Gap between Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning for End-to-End Speech Translation,"End-to-end speech translation, a hot topic in recent years, aims to translate a segment of audio into a specific language with an end-to-end model. Conventional approaches employ multi-task learning and pre-training methods for this task, but they suffer from the huge gap between pre-training and fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Tandem Connectionist Encoding Network (TCEN) which bridges the gap by reusing all subnets in fine-tuning, keeping the roles of subnets consistent, and pre-training the attention module. Furthermore, we propose two simple but effective methods to guarantee the speech encoder outputs and the MT encoder inputs are consistent in terms of semantic representation and sequence length. Experimental results show that our model leads to significant improvements in En-De and En-Fr translation irrespective of the backbones."
Improving Knowledge-Aware Dialogue Generation via Knowledge Base Question Answering,"Neural network models usually suffer from the challenge of incorporating commonsense knowledge into the open-domain dialogue systems. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-aware dialogue generation model (called TransDG), which transfers question representation and knowledge matching abilities from knowledge base question answering (KBQA) task to facilitate the utterance understanding and factual knowledge selection for dialogue generation. In addition, we propose a response guiding attention and a multi-step decoding strategy to steer our model to focus on relevant features for response generation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model has robust superiority over compared methods in generating informative and fluent dialogues. Our code is available at https://github.com/siat-nlp/TransDG."
Sentiment Classification in Customer Service Dialogue with Topic-Aware Multi-Task Learning,"Sentiment analysis in dialogues plays a critical role in dialogue data analysis. However, previous studies on sentiment classification in dialogues largely ignore topic information, which is important for capturing overall information in some types of dialogues. In this study, we focus on the sentiment classification task in an important type of dialogue, namely customer service dialogue, and propose a novel approach which captures overall information to enhance the classification performance. Specifically, we propose a topic-aware multi-task learning (TML) approach which learns topic-enriched utterance representations in customer service dialogue by capturing various kinds of topic information. In the experiment, we propose a large-scale and high-quality annotated corpus for the sentiment classification task in customer service dialogue and empirical studies on the proposed corpus show that our approach significantly outperforms several strong baselines."
Storytelling from an Image Stream Using Scene Graphs,"Visual storytelling aims at generating a story from an image stream. Most existing methods tend to represent images directly with the extracted high-level features, which is not intuitive and difficult to interpret. We argue that translating each image into a graph-based semantic representation, i.e., scene graph, which explicitly encodes the objects and relationships detected within image, would benefit representing and describing images. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based architecture for visual storytelling by modeling the two-level relationships on scene graphs. In particular, on the within-image level, we employ a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to enrich local fine-grained region representations of objects on scene graphs. To further model the interaction among images, on the cross-images level, a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) is utilized to refine the region representations along the temporal dimension. Then the relation-aware representations are fed into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with attention mechanism for story generation. Experiments are conducted on the public visual storytelling dataset. Automatic and human evaluation results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art."
Multi-Task Self-Supervised Learning for Disfluency Detection,"Most existing approaches to disfluency detection heavily rely on human-annotated data, which is expensive to obtain in practice. To tackle the training data bottleneck, we investigate methods for combining multiple self-supervised tasks-i.e., supervised tasks where data can be collected without manual labeling. First, we construct large-scale pseudo training data by randomly adding or deleting words from unlabeled news data, and propose two self-supervised pre-training tasks: (i) tagging task to detect the added noisy words. (ii) sentence classification to distinguish original sentences from grammatically-incorrect sentences. We then combine these two tasks to jointly train a network. The pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using human-annotated disfluency detection training data. Experimental results on the commonly used English Switchboard test set show that our approach can achieve competitive performance compared to the previous systems (trained using the full dataset) by using less than 1% (1000 sentences) of the training data. Our method trained on the full dataset significantly outperforms previous methods, reducing the error by 21% on English Switchboard."
Probing Brain Activation Patterns by Dissociating Semantics and Syntax in Sentences,"The relation between semantics and syntax and where they are represented in the neural level has been extensively debated in neurosciences. Existing methods use manually designed stimuli to distinguish semantic and syntactic information in a sentence that may not generalize beyond the experimental setting. This paper proposes an alternative framework to study the brain representation of semantics and syntax. Specifically, we embed the highly-controlled stimuli as objective functions in learning sentence representations and propose a disentangled feature representation model (DFRM) to extract semantic and syntactic information in sentences. This model can generate one semantic and one syntactic vector for each sentence. Then we associate these disentangled feature vectors with brain imaging data to explore brain representation of semantics and syntax. Results have shown that semantic feature is represented more robustly than syntactic feature across the brain including the default-mode, frontoparietal, visual networks, etc.. The brain representations of semantics and syntax are largely overlapped, but there are brain regions only sensitive to one of them. For instance, several frontal and temporal regions are specific to the semantic feature; parts of the right superior frontal and right inferior parietal gyrus are specific to the syntactic feature."
Multi-Level Head-Wise Match and Aggregation in Transformer for Textual Sequence Matching,"Transformer has been successfully applied to many natural language processing tasks. However, for textual sequence matching, simple matching between the representation of a pair of sequences might bring in unnecessary noise. In this paper, we propose a new approach to sequence pair matching with Transformer, by learning head-wise matching representations on multiple levels. Experiments show that our proposed approach can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks that rely only on pre-computed sequence-vector-representation, such as SNLI, MNLI-match, MNLI-mismatch, QQP, and SQuAD-binary."
Masking Orchestration: Multi-Task Pretraining for Multi-Role Dialogue Representation Learning,"Multi-role dialogue understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as question answering, act classification, dialogue summarization etc. While dialogue corpora are abundantly available, labeled data, for specific learning tasks, can be highly scarce and expensive. In this work, we investigate dialogue context representation learning with various types unsupervised pretraining tasks where the training objectives are given naturally according to the nature of the utterance and the structure of the multi-role conversation. Meanwhile, in order to locate essential information for dialogue summarization/extraction, the pretraining process enables external knowledge integration. The proposed fine-tuned pretraining mechanism is comprehensively evaluated via three different dialogue datasets along with a number of downstream dialogue-mining tasks. Result shows that the proposed pretraining mechanism significantly contributes to all the downstream tasks without discrimination to different encoders."
Integrating Deep Learning with Logic Fusion for Information Extraction,"Information extraction (IE) aims to produce structured information from an input text, e.g., Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction. Various attempts have been proposed for IE via feature engineering or deep learning. However, most of them fail to associate the complex relationships inherent in the task itself, which has proven to be especially crucial. For example, the relation between 2 entities is highly dependent on their entity types. These dependencies can be regarded as complex constraints that can be efficiently expressed as logical rules. To combine such logic reasoning capabilities with learning capabilities of deep neural networks, we propose to integrate logical knowledge in the form of first-order logic into a deep learning system, which can be trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. The integrated framework is able to enhance neural outputs with knowledge regularization via logic rules, and at the same time update the weights of logic rules to comply with the characteristics of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed model on multiple IE tasks."
Go From the General to the Particular: Multi-Domain Translation with Domain Transformation Networks,"The key challenge of multi-domain translation lies in simultaneously encoding both the general knowledge shared across domains and the particular knowledge distinctive to each domain in a unified model. Previous work shows that the standard neural machine translation (NMT) model, trained on mixed-domain data, generally captures the general knowledge, but misses the domain-specific knowledge. In response to this problem, we augment NMT model with additional domain transformation networks to transform the general representations to domain-specific representations, which are subsequently fed to the NMT decoder. To guarantee the knowledge transformation, we also propose two complementary supervision signals by leveraging the power of knowledge distillation and adversarial learning. Experimental results on several language pairs, covering both balanced and unbalanced multi-domain translation, demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed approach. Encouragingly, the proposed unified model achieves comparable results with the fine-tuning approach that requires multiple models to preserve the particular knowledge. Further analyses reveal that the domain transformation networks successfully capture the domain-specific knowledge as expected.1"
TextNAS: A Neural Architecture Search Space Tailored for Text Representation,"Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other language related tasks. There are a diverse set of text representation networks in the literature, and how to find the optimal one is a non-trivial problem. Recently, the emerging Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques have demonstrated good potential to solve the problem. Nevertheless, most of the existing works of NAS focus on the search algorithms and pay little attention to the search space. In this paper, we argue that the search space is also an important human prior to the success of NAS in different applications. Thus, we propose a novel search space tailored for text representation. Through automatic search, the discovered network architecture outperforms state-of-the-art models on various public datasets on text classification and natural language inference tasks. Furthermore, some of the design principles found in the automatic network agree well with human intuition."
Learning Multi-Level Dependencies for Robust Word Recognition,"Robust language processing systems are becoming increasingly important given the recent awareness of dangerous situations where brittle machine learning models can be easily broken with the presence of noises. In this paper, we introduce a robust word recognition framework that captures multi-level sequential dependencies in noised sentences. The proposed framework employs a sequence-to-sequence model over characters of each word, whose output is given to a word-level bi-directional recurrent neural network. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the framework. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin and they also suggest that character-level dependencies can play an important role in word recognition. The code of the proposed framework and the major experiments are publicly available1."
GRET: Global Representation Enhanced Transformer,"Transformer, based on the encoder-decoder framework, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several natural language generation tasks. The encoder maps the words in the input sentence into a sequence of hidden states, which are then fed into the decoder to generate the output sentence. These hidden states usually correspond to the input words and focus on capturing local information. However, the global (sentence level) information is seldom explored, leaving room for the improvement of generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel global representation enhanced Transformer (GRET) to explicitly model global representation in the Transformer network. Specifically, in the proposed model, an external state is generated for the global representation from the encoder. The global representation is then fused into the decoder during the decoding process to improve generation quality. We conduct experiments in two text generation tasks: machine translation and text summarization. Experimental results on four WMT machine translation tasks and LCSTS text summarization task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on natural language generation1."
Acquiring Knowledge from Pre-Trained Model to Neural Machine Translation,"Pre-training and fine-tuning have achieved great success in natural language process field. The standard paradigm of exploiting them includes two steps: first, pre-training a model, e.g. BERT, with a large scale unlabeled monolingual data. Then, fine-tuning the pre-trained model with labeled data from downstream tasks. However, in neural machine translation (NMT), we address the problem that the training objective of the bilingual task is far different from the monolingual pre-trained model. This gap leads that only using fine-tuning in NMT can not fully utilize prior language knowledge. In this paper, we propose an Apt framework for acquiring knowledge from pre-trained model to NMT. The proposed approach includes two modules: 1). a dynamic fusion mechanism to fuse task-specific features adapted from general knowledge into NMT network, 2). a knowledge distillation paradigm to learn language knowledge continuously during the NMT training process. The proposed approach could integrate suitable knowledge from pre-trained models to improve the NMT. Experimental results on WMT English to German, German to English and Chinese to English machine translation tasks show that our model outperforms strong baselines and the fine-tuning counterparts."
Enhanced Meta-Learning for Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition with Minimal Resources,"For languages with no annotated resources, transferring knowledge from rich-resource languages is an effective solution for named entity recognition (NER). While all existing methods directly transfer from source-learned model to a target language, in this paper, we propose to fine-tune the learned model with a few similar examples given a test case, which could benefit the prediction by leveraging the structural and semantic information conveyed in such similar examples. To this end, we present a meta-learning algorithm to find a good model parameter initialization that could fast adapt to the given test case and propose to construct multiple pseudo-NER tasks for meta-training by computing sentence similarities. To further improve the model's generalization ability across different languages, we introduce a masking scheme and augment the loss function with an additional maximum term during meta-training. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-lingual named entity recognition with minimal resources over five target languages. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across the board."
Importance-Aware Learning for Neural Headline Editing,"Many social media news writers are not professionally trained. Therefore, social media platforms have to hire professional editors to adjust amateur headlines to attract more readers. We propose to automate this headline editing process through neural network models to provide more immediate writing support for these social media news writers. To train such a neural headline editing model, we collected a dataset which contains articles with original headlines and professionally edited headlines. However, it is expensive to collect a large number of professionally edited headlines. To solve this low-resource problem, we design an encoder-decoder model which leverages large scale pre-trained language models. We further improve the pre-trained model's quality by introducing a headline generation task as an intermediate task before the headline editing task. Also, we propose Self Importance-Aware (SIA) loss to address the different levels of editing in the dataset by down-weighting the importance of easily classified tokens and sentences. With the help of Pre-training, Adaptation, and SIA, the model learns to generate headlines in the professional editor's style. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of headline editing comparing against previous methods."
A Dataset for Low-Resource Stylized Sequence-to-Sequence Generation,"Low-resource stylized sequence-to-sequence (S2S) generation is in high demand. However, its development is hindered by the datasets which have limitations on scale and automatic evaluation methods. We construct two large-scale, multiple-reference datasets for low-resource stylized S2S, the Machine Translation Formality Corpus (MTFC) that is easy to evaluate and the Twitter Conversation Formality Corpus (TCFC) that tackles an important problem in chatbots. These datasets contain context to source style parallel data, source style to target parallel data, and non-parallel sentences in the target style to enable the semi-supervised learning. We provide three baselines, the pivot-based method, the teacher-student method, and the back-translation method. We find that the pivot-based method is the worst, and the other two methods achieve the best score on different metrics."
Latent Opinions Transfer Network for Target-Oriented Opinion Words Extraction,"Target-oriented opinion words extraction (TOWE) is a new subtask of ABSA, which aims to extract the corresponding opinion words for a given opinion target in a sentence. Recently, neural network methods have been applied to this task and achieve promising results. However, the difficulty of annotation causes the datasets of TOWE to be insufficient, which heavily limits the performance of neural models. By contrast, abundant review sentiment classification data are easily available at online review sites. These reviews contain substantial latent opinions information and semantic patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel model to transfer these opinions knowledge from resource-rich review sentiment classification datasets to low-resource task TOWE. To address the challenges in the transfer process, we design an effective transformation method to obtain latent opinions, then integrate them into TOWE. Extensive experimental results show that our model achieves better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms the base model without transferring opinions knowledge. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of our model."
Copy or Rewrite: Hybrid Summarization with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Jointly using the extractive and abstractive summarization methods can combine their complementary advantages, generating both informative and concise summary. Existing methods that adopt an extract-then-abstract strategy have achieved impressive results, yet they suffer from the information loss in the abstraction step because they compress all the selected sentences without distinguish. Especially when the whole sentence is summary-worthy, salient content would be lost by compression. To address this problem, we propose HySum, a hybrid framework for summarization that can flexibly switch between copying sentence and rewriting sentence according to the degree of redundancy. In this way, our approach can effectively combine the advantages of two branches of summarization, juggling informativity and conciseness. Moreover, we based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, propose an end-to-end reinforcing method to bridge together the extraction module and rewriting module, which can enhance the cooperation between them. Automatic evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the CNN/DailyMail corpus. Human evaluation also demonstrates that our generated summaries are more informative and concise than popular models."
Joint Entity and Relation Extraction with a Hybrid Transformer and Reinforcement Learning Based Model,"Joint extraction of entities and relations is a task that extracts the entity mentions and semantic relations between entities from the unstructured texts with one single model. Existing entity and relation extraction datasets usually rely on distant supervision methods which cannot identify the corresponding relations between a relation and the sentence, thus suffers from noisy labeling problem. We propose a hybrid deep neural network model to jointly extract the entities and relations, and the model is also capable of filtering noisy data. The hybrid model contains a transformer-based encoding layer, an LSTM entity detection module and a reinforcement learning-based relation classification module. The output of the transformer encoder and the entity embedding generated from the entity detection module are combined as the input state of the reinforcement learning module to improve the relation classification and noisy data filtering. We conduct experiments on the public dataset produced by the distant supervision method to verify the effectiveness of our proposed model. Different experimental results show that our model gains better performance on entity and relation extraction than the compared methods and also has the ability to filter noisy sentences."
Attentive User-Engaged Adversarial Neural Network for Community Question Answering,"We study the community question answering (CQA) problem that emerges with the advent of numerous community forums in the recent past. The task of finding appropriate answers to questions from informative but noisy crowdsourced answers is important yet challenging in practice. We present an Attentive User-engaged Adversarial Neural Network (AUANN), which interactively learns the context information of questions and answers, and enhances user engagement with the CQA task. A novel attentive mechanism is incorporated to model the semantic internal and external relations among questions, answers and user contexts. To handle the noise issue caused by introducing user context, we design a two-step denoise mechanism, including a coarse-grained selection process by similarity measurement, and a fine-grained selection process by applying an adversarial training module. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale real-world datasets SemEval-2016 and SemEval-2017. Experimental results verify the benefits of incorporating user information, and show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
Hashing Based Answer Selection,"Answer selection is an important subtask of question answering (QA), in which deep models usually achieve better performance than non-deep models. Most deep models adopt question-answer interaction mechanisms, such as attention, to get vector representations for answers. When these interaction based deep models are deployed for online prediction, the representations of all answers need to be recalculated for each question. This procedure is time-consuming for deep models with complex encoders like BERT which usually have better accuracy than simple encoders. One possible solution is to store the matrix representation (encoder output) of each answer in memory to avoid recalculation. But this will bring large memory cost. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called hashing based answer selection (HAS), to tackle this problem. HAS adopts a hashing strategy to learn a binary matrix representation for each answer, which can dramatically reduce the memory cost for storing the matrix representations of answers. Hence, HAS can adopt complex encoders like BERT in the model, but the online prediction of HAS is still fast with a low memory cost. Experimental results on three popular answer selection datasets show that HAS can outperform existing models to achieve state-of-the-art performance."
Knowledge Graph Grounded Goal Planning for Open-Domain Conversation Generation,"Previous neural models on open-domain conversation generation have no effective mechanisms to manage chatting topics, and tend to produce less coherent dialogs. Inspired by the strategies in human-human dialogs, we divide the task of multi-turn open-domain conversation generation into two sub-tasks: explicit goal (chatting about a topic) sequence planning and goal completion by topic elaboration. To this end, we propose a three-layer Knowledge aware Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning based Model (KnowHRL). Specifically, for the first sub-task, the upper-layer policy learns to traverse a knowledge graph (KG) in order to plan a high-level goal sequence towards a good balance between dialog coherence and topic consistency with user interests. For the second sub-task, the middle-layer policy and the lower-layer one work together to produce an in-depth multi-turn conversation about a single topic with a goal-driven generation mechanism. The capability of goal-sequence planning enables chatbots to conduct proactive open-domain conversations towards recommended topics, which has many practical applications. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state of the art baselines in terms of user-interest consistency, dialog coherence, and knowledge accuracy."
The Value of Paraphrase for Knowledge Base Predicates,"Paraphrase, i.e., differing textual realizations of the same meaning, has proven useful for many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Collecting paraphrase for predicates in knowledge bases (KBs) is the key to comprehend the RDF triples in KBs. Existing works have published some paraphrase datasets automatically extracted from large corpora, but have too many redundant pairs or don't cover enough predicates, which cannot be improved by computer only and need the help of human beings. This paper shows a full process of collecting large-scale and high-quality paraphrase dictionaries for predicates in knowledge bases, which takes advantage of existing datasets and combines the technologies of machine mining and crowdsourcing. Our dataset comprises 2284 distinct predicates in DBpedia and 31130 paraphrase pairs in total, the quality of which is a great leap over previous works. Then it is demonstrated that such good paraphrase dictionaries can do great help to natural language processing tasks such as question answering and language generation. We also publish our own dictionary for further research."
Coordinated Reasoning for Cross-Lingual Knowledge Graph Alignment,"Existing entity alignment methods mainly vary on the choices of encoding the knowledge graph, but they typically use the same decoding method, which independently chooses the local optimal match for each source entity. This decoding method may not only cause the “many-to-one” problem but also neglect the coordinated nature of this task, that is, each alignment decision may highly correlate to the other decisions. In this paper, we introduce two coordinated reasoning methods, i.e., the Easy-to-Hard decoding strategy and joint entity alignment algorithm. Specifically, the Easy-to-Hard strategy first retrieves the model-confident alignments from the predicted results and then incorporates them as additional knowledge to resolve the remaining model-uncertain alignments. To achieve this, we further propose an enhanced alignment model that is built on the current state-of-the-art baseline. In addition, to address the many-to-one problem, we propose to jointly predict entity alignments so that the one-to-one constraint can be naturally incorporated into the alignment prediction. Experimental results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance and our reasoning methods can also significantly improve existing baselines."
Improving Domain-Adapted Sentiment Classification by Deep Adversarial Mutual Learning,"Domain-adapted sentiment classification refers to training on a labeled source domain to well infer document-level sentiment on an unlabeled target domain. Most existing relevant models involve a feature extractor and a sentiment classifier, where the feature extractor works towards learning domain-invariant features from both domains, and the sentiment classifier is trained only on the source domain to guide the feature extractor. As such, they lack a mechanism to use sentiment polarity lying in the target domain. To improve domain-adapted sentiment classification by learning sentiment from the target domain as well, we devise a novel deep adversarial mutual learning approach involving two groups of feature extractors, domain discriminators, sentiment classifiers, and label probers. The domain discriminators enable the feature extractors to obtain domain-invariant features. Meanwhile, the label prober in each group explores document sentiment polarity of the target domain through the sentiment prediction generated by the classifier in the peer group, and guides the learning of the feature extractor in its own group. The proposed approach achieves the mutual learning of the two groups in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on multiple public datasets indicate our method obtains the state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of mutual learning through label probers."
Knowledge and Cross-Pair Pattern Guided Semantic Matching for Question Answering,"Semantic matching is a basic problem in natural language processing, but it is far from solved because of the differences between the pairs for matching. In question answering (QA), answer selection (AS) is a popular semantic matching task, usually reformulated as a paraphrase identification (PI) problem. However, QA is different from PI because the question and the answer are not synonymous sentences and not strictly comparable. In this work, a novel knowledge and cross-pair pattern guided semantic matching system (KCG) is proposed, which considers both knowledge and pattern conditions for QA. We apply explicit cross-pair matching based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to help KCG recognize general domain-independent Q-to-A patterns better. And with the incorporation of domain-specific information from knowledge bases (KB), KCG is able to capture and explore various relations within Q-A pairs. Experiments show that KCG is robust against the diversity of Q-A pairs and outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on different answer selection tasks."
Towards Making the Most of BERT in Neural Machine Translation,"GPT-2 and BERT demonstrate the effectiveness of using pre-trained language models (LMs) on various natural language processing tasks. However, LM fine-tuning often suffers from catastrophic forgetting when applied to resource-rich tasks. In this work, we introduce a concerted training framework (CTnmt) that is the key to integrate the pre-trained LMs to neural machine translation (NMT). Our proposed CTnmt} consists of three techniques: a) asymptotic distillation to ensure that the NMT model can retain the previous pre-trained knowledge; b) a dynamic switching gate to avoid catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge; and c) a strategy to adjust the learning paces according to a scheduled policy. Our experiments in machine translation show CTnmt gains of up to 3 BLEU score on the WMT14 English-German language pair which even surpasses the previous state-of-the-art pre-training aided NMT by 1.4 BLEU score. While for the large WMT14 English-French task with 40 millions of sentence-pairs, our base model still significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art Transformer big model by more than 1 BLEU score."
Alternating Language Modeling for Cross-Lingual Pre-Training,"Language model pre-training has achieved success in many natural language processing tasks. Existing methods for cross-lingual pre-training adopt Translation Language Model to predict masked words with the concatenation of the source sentence and its target equivalent. In this work, we introduce a novel cross-lingual pre-training method, called Alternating Language Modeling (ALM). It code-switches sentences of different languages rather than simple concatenation, hoping to capture the rich cross-lingual context of words and phrases. More specifically, we randomly substitute source phrases with target translations to create code-switched sentences. Then, we use these code-switched data to train ALM model to learn to predict words of different languages. We evaluate our pre-training ALM on the downstream tasks of machine translation and cross-lingual classification. Experiments show that ALM can outperform the previous pre-training methods on three benchmarks.1"
Generalize Sentence Representation with Self-Inference,"In this paper, we propose Self Inference Neural Network (SINN), a simple yet efficient sentence encoder which leverages knowledge from recurrent and convolutional neural networks. SINN gathers semantic evidence in an interaction space which is subsequently fused by a shared vector gate to determine the most relevant mixture of contextual information. We evaluate the proposed method on four benchmarks among three NLP tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our model sets a new state-of-the-art on MultiNLI, Scitail and is competitive on the remaining two datasets over all sentence encoding methods. The encoding and inference process in our model is highly interpretable. Through visualizations of the fusion component, we open the black box of our network and explore the applicability of the base encoding methods case by case."
End-to-End Bootstrapping Neural Network for Entity Set Expansion,"Bootstrapping for entity set expansion (ESE) has long been modeled as a multi-step pipelined process. Such a paradigm, unfortunately, often suffers from two main challenges: 1) the entities are expanded in multiple separate steps, which tends to introduce noisy entities and results in the semantic drift problem; 2) it is hard to exploit the high-order entity-pattern relations for entity set expansion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end bootstrapping neural network for entity set expansion, named BootstrapNet, which models the bootstrapping in an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoding stage, a graph attention network is used to capture both the first- and the high-order relations between entities and patterns, and encode useful information into their representations. In the decoding stage, the entities are sequentially expanded through a recurrent neural network, which outputs entities at each stage, and its hidden state vectors, representing the target category, are updated at each expansion step. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvement of our model over previous ESE approaches."
"Be Relevant, Non-Redundant, and Timely: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Event Summarization","Real-time event summarization is an essential task in natural language processing and information retrieval areas. Despite the progress of previous work, generating relevant, non-redundant, and timely event summaries remains challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement learning framework for real-time Event Summarization (DRES), which shows promising performance for resolving all three challenges (i.e., relevance, non-redundancy, timeliness) in a unified framework. Specifically, we (i) devise a hierarchical cross-attention network with intra- and inter-document attentions to integrate important semantic features within and between the query and input document for better text matching. In addition, relevance prediction is leveraged as an auxiliary task to strengthen the document modeling and help to extract relevant documents; (ii) propose a multi-topic dynamic memory network to capture the sequential patterns of different topics belonging to the event of interest and temporally memorize the input facts from the evolving document stream, avoiding extracting redundant information at each time step; (iii) consider both historical dependencies and future uncertainty of the document stream for generating relevant and timely summaries by exploiting the reinforcement learning technique. Experimental results on two real-world datasets have demonstrated the advantages of DRES model with significant improvement in generating relevant, non-redundant, and timely event summaries against the state-of-the-arts."
Visual Agreement Regularized Training for Multi-Modal Machine Translation,"Multi-modal machine translation aims at translating the source sentence into a different language in the presence of the paired image. Previous work suggests that additional visual information only provides dispensable help to translation, which is needed in several very special cases such as translating ambiguous words. To make better use of visual information, this work presents visual agreement regularized training. The proposed approach jointly trains the source-to-target and target-to-source translation models and encourages them to share the same focus on the visual information when generating semantically equivalent visual words (e.g. “ball” in English and “ballon” in French). Besides, a simple yet effective multi-head co-attention model is also introduced to capture interactions between visual and textual features. The results show that our approaches can outperform competitive baselines by a large margin on the Multi30k dataset. Further analysis demonstrates that the proposed regularized training can effectively improve the agreement of attention on the image, leading to better use of visual information."
Causally Denoise Word Embeddings Using Half-Sibling Regression,"Distributional representations of words, also known as word vectors, have become crucial for modern natural language processing tasks due to their wide applications. Recently, a growing body of word vector postprocessing algorithm has emerged, aiming to render off-the-shelf word vectors even stronger. In line with these investigations, we introduce a novel word vector postprocessing scheme under a causal inference framework. Concretely, the postprocessing pipeline is realized by Half-Sibling Regression (HSR), which allows us to identify and remove confounding noise contained in word vectors. Compared to previous work, our proposed method has the advantages of interpretability and transparency due to its causal inference grounding. Evaluated on a battery of standard lexical-level evaluation tasks and downstream sentiment analysis tasks, our method reaches state-of-the-art performance."
A Causal Inference Method for Reducing Gender Bias in Word Embedding Relations,"Word embedding has become essential for natural language processing as it boosts empirical performances of various tasks. However, recent research discovers that gender bias is incorporated in neural word embeddings, and downstream tasks that rely on these biased word vectors also produce gender-biased results. While some word-embedding gender-debiasing methods have been developed, these methods mainly focus on reducing gender bias associated with gender direction and fail to reduce the gender bias presented in word embedding relations. In this paper, we design a causal and simple approach for mitigating gender bias in word vector relation by utilizing the statistical dependency between gender-definition word embeddings and gender-biased word embeddings. Our method attains state-of-the-art results on gender-debiasing tasks, lexical- and sentence-level evaluation tasks, and downstream coreference resolution tasks."
Integrating Relation Constraints with Neural Relation Extractors,"Recent years have seen rapid progress in identifying predefined relationship between entity pairs using neural networks (NNs). However, such models often make predictions for each entity pair individually, thus often fail to solve the inconsistency among different predictions, which can be characterized by discrete relation constraints. These constraints are often defined over combinations of entity-relation-entity triples, since there often lack of explicitly well-defined type and cardinality requirements for the relations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to integrate relation constraints with NNs by introducing a new loss term, Constraint Loss. Particularly, we develop two efficient methods to capture how well the local predictions from multiple instance pairs satisfy the relation constraints. Experiments on both English and Chinese datasets show that our approach can help NNs learn from discrete relation constraints to reduce inconsistency among local predictions, and outperform popular neural relation extraction (NRE) models even enhanced with extra post-processing. Our source code and datasets will be released at https://github.com/PKUYeYuan/Constraint-Loss-AAAI-2020."
MixPoet: Diverse Poetry Generation via Learning Controllable Mixed Latent Space,"As an essential step towards computer creativity, automatic poetry generation has gained increasing attention these years. Though recent neural models make prominent progress in some criteria of poetry quality, generated poems still suffer from the problem of poor diversity. Related literature researches show that different factors, such as life experience, historical background, etc., would influence composition styles of poets, which considerably contributes to the high diversity of human-authored poetry. Inspired by this, we propose MixPoet, a novel model that absorbs multiple factors to create various styles and promote diversity. Based on a semi-supervised variational autoencoder, our model disentangles the latent space into some subspaces, with each conditioned on one influence factor by adversarial training. In this way, the model learns a controllable latent variable to capture and mix generalized factor-related properties. Different factor mixtures lead to diverse styles and hence further differentiate generated poems from each other. Experiment results on Chinese poetry demonstrate that MixPoet improves both diversity and quality against three state-of-the-art models."
PHASEN: A Phase-and-Harmonics-Aware Speech Enhancement Network,"Time-frequency (T-F) domain masking is a mainstream approach for single-channel speech enhancement. Recently, focuses have been put to phase prediction in addition to amplitude prediction. In this paper, we propose a phase-and-harmonics-aware deep neural network (DNN), named PHASEN, for this task. Unlike previous methods which directly use a complex ideal ratio mask to supervise the DNN learning, we design a two-stream network, where amplitude stream and phase stream are dedicated to amplitude and phase prediction. We discover that the two streams should communicate with each other, and this is crucial to phase prediction. In addition, we propose frequency transformation blocks to catch long-range correlations along the frequency axis. Visualization shows that the learned transformation matrix implicitly captures the harmonic correlation, which has been proven to be helpful for T-F spectrogram reconstruction. With these two innovations, PHASEN acquires the ability to handle detailed phase patterns and to utilize harmonic patterns, getting 1.76dB SDR improvement on AVSpeech + AudioSet dataset. It also achieves significant gains over Google's network on this dataset. On Voice Bank + DEMAND dataset, PHASEN outperforms previous methods by a large margin on four metrics."
Meta-CoTGAN: A Meta Cooperative Training Paradigm for Improving Adversarial Text Generation,"Training generative models that can generate high-quality text with sufficient diversity is an important open problem for Natural Language Generation (NLG) community. Recently, generative adversarial models have been applied extensively on text generation tasks, where the adversarially trained generators alleviate the exposure bias experienced by conventional maximum likelihood approaches and result in promising generation quality. However, due to the notorious defect of mode collapse for adversarial training, the adversarially trained generators face a quality-diversity trade-off, i.e., the generator models tend to sacrifice generation diversity severely for increasing generation quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which aims to improve the performance of adversarial text generation via efficiently decelerating mode collapse of the adversarial training. To this end, we introduce a cooperative training paradigm, where a language model is cooperatively trained with the generator and we utilize the language model to efficiently shape the data distribution of the generator against mode collapse. Moreover, instead of engaging the cooperative update for the generator in a principled way, we formulate a meta learning mechanism, where the cooperative update to the generator serves as a high level meta task, with an intuition of ensuring the parameters of the generator after the adversarial update would stay resistant against mode collapse. In the experiment, we demonstrate our proposed approach can efficiently slow down the pace of mode collapse for the adversarial text generators. Overall, our proposed method is able to outperform the baseline approaches with significant margins in terms of both generation quality and diversity in the testified domains."
Dialog State Tracking with Reinforced Data Augmentation,"Neural dialog state trackers are generally limited due to the lack of quantity and diversity of annotated training data. In this paper, we address this difficulty by proposing a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework for data augmentation that can generate high-quality data to improve the neural state tracker. Specifically, we introduce a novel contextual bandit generator to learn fine-grained augmentation policies that can generate new effective instances by choosing suitable replacements for specific context. Moreover, by alternately learning between the generator and the state tracker, we can keep refining the generative policies to generate more high-quality training data for neural state tracker. Experimental results on the WoZ and MultiWoZ (restaurant) datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance over the state-of-the-art models, especially with limited training data."
Enhancing Pointer Network for Sentence Ordering with Pairwise Ordering Predictions,"Dominant sentence ordering models use a pointer network decoder to generate ordering sequences in a left-to-right fashion. However, such a decoder only exploits the noisy left-side encoded context, which is insufficient to ensure correct sentence ordering. To address this deficiency, we propose to enhance the pointer network decoder by using two pairwise ordering prediction modules: The FUTURE module predicts the relative orientations of other unordered sentences with respect to the candidate sentence, and the HISTORY module measures the local coherence between several (e.g., 2) previously ordered sentences and the candidate sentence, without the influence of noisy left-side context. Using the pointer mechanism, we then incorporate this dynamically generated information into the decoder as a supplement to the left-side context for better predictions. On several commonly-used datasets, our model significantly outperforms other baselines, achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Further analyses verify that pairwise ordering predictions indeed provide extra useful context as expected, leading to better sentence ordering. We also evaluate our sentence ordering models on a downstream task, multi-document summarization, and the summaries reordered by our model achieve the best coherence scores. Our code is available at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/Pairwise.git."
Automatic Generation of Headlines for Online Math Questions,"Mathematical equations are an important part of dissemination and communication of scientific information. Students, however, often feel challenged in reading and understanding math content and equations. With the development of the Web, students are posting their math questions online. Nevertheless, constructing a concise math headline that gives a good description of the posted detailed math question is nontrivial. In this study, we explore a novel summarization task denoted as geNerating A concise Math hEadline from a detailed math question (NAME). Compared to conventional summarization tasks, this task has two extra and essential constraints: 1) Detailed math questions consist of text and math equations which require a unified framework to jointly model textual and mathematical information; 2) Unlike text, math equations contain semantic and structural features, and both of them should be captured together. To address these issues, we propose MathSum, a novel summarization model which utilizes a pointer mechanism combined with a multi-head attention mechanism for mathematical representation augmentation. The pointer mechanism can either copy textual tokens or math tokens from source questions in order to generate math headlines. The multi-head attention mechanism is designed to enrich the representation of math equations by modeling and integrating both its semantic and structural features. For evaluation, we collect and make available two sets of real-world detailed math questions along with human-written math headlines, namely EXEQ-300k and OFEQ-10k. Experimental results demonstrate that our model (MathSum) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models for both the EXEQ-300k and OFEQ-10k datasets."
Improving Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation Using Self-Attentive Sentence Embedding,"Fully Attentional Networks (FAN) like Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) has shown superior results in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks and has become a solid baseline for translation tasks. More recent studies also have reported experimental results that additional contextual sentences improve translation qualities of NMT models (Voita et al. 2018; Müller et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). However, those studies have exploited multiple context sentences as a single long concatenated sentence, that may cause the models to suffer from inefficient computational complexities and long-range dependencies. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Context Encoder (HCE) that is able to exploit multiple context sentences separately using the hierarchical FAN structure. Our proposed encoder first abstracts sentence-level information from preceding sentences in a self-attentive way, and then hierarchically encodes context-level information. Through extensive experiments, we observe that our HCE records the best performance measured in BLEU score on English-German, English-Turkish, and English-Korean corpus. In addition, we observe that our HCE records the best performance in a crowd-sourced test set which is designed to evaluate how well an encoder can exploit contextual information. Finally, evaluation on English-Korean pronoun resolution test suite also shows that our HCE can properly exploit contextual information."
CopyMTL: Copy Mechanism for Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations with Multi-Task Learning,"Joint extraction of entities and relations has received significant attention due to its potential of providing higher performance for both tasks. Among existing methods, CopyRE is effective and novel, which uses a sequence-to-sequence framework and copy mechanism to directly generate the relation triplets. However, it suffers from two fatal problems. The model is extremely weak at differing the head and tail entity, resulting in inaccurate entity extraction. It also cannot predict multi-token entities (e.g. Steven Jobs). To address these problems, we give a detailed analysis of the reasons behind the inaccurate entity extraction problem, and then propose a simple but extremely effective model structure to solve this problem. In addition, we propose a multi-task learning framework equipped with copy mechanism, called CopyMTL, to allow the model to predict multi-token entities. Experiments reveal the problems of CopyRE and show that our model achieves significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art method by 9% in NYT and 16% in WebNLG (F1 score). Our code is available at https://github.com/WindChimeRan/CopyMTL"
Neural Simile Recognition with Cyclic Multitask Learning and Local Attention,"Simile recognition is to detect simile sentences and to extract simile components, i.e., tenors and vehicles. It involves two subtasks: simile sentence classification and simile component extraction. Recent work has shown that standard multitask learning is effective for Chinese simile recognition, but it is still uncertain whether the mutual effects between the subtasks have been well captured by simple parameter sharing. We propose a novel cyclic multitask learning framework for neural simile recognition, which stacks the subtasks and makes them into a loop by connecting the last to the first. It iteratively performs each subtask, taking the outputs of the previous subtask as additional inputs to the current one, so that the interdependence between the subtasks can be better explored. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art model and our carefully designed baselines, and the gains are still remarkable using BERT.

Span Model for Open Information Extraction on Accurate Corpus,"Open Information Extraction (Open IE) is a challenging task especially due to its brittle data basis. Most of Open IE systems have to be trained on automatically built corpus and evaluated on inaccurate test set. In this work, we first alleviate this difficulty from both sides of training and test sets. For the former, we propose an improved model design to more sufficiently exploit training dataset. For the latter, we present our accurately re-annotated benchmark test set (Re-OIE2016) according to a series of linguistic observation and analysis. Then, we introduce a span model instead of previous adopted sequence labeling formulization for n-ary Open IE. Our newly introduced model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both benchmark evaluation datasets."
Multi-Point Semantic Representation for Intent Classification,"Detecting user intents from utterances is the basis of natural language understanding (NLU) task. To understand the meaning of utterances, some work focuses on fully representing utterances via semantic parsing in which annotation cost is labor-intentsive. While some researchers simply view this as intent classification or frequently asked questions (FAQs) retrieval, they do not leverage the shared utterances among different intents. We propose a simple and novel multi-point semantic representation framework with relatively low annotation cost to leverage the fine-grained factor information, decomposing queries into four factors, i.e., topic, predicate, object/condition, query type. Besides, we propose a compositional intent bi-attention model under multi-task learning with three kinds of attention mechanisms among queries, labels and factors, which jointly combines coarse-grained intent and fine-grained factor information. Extensive experiments show that our framework and model significantly outperform several state-of-the-art approaches with an improvement of 1.35%-2.47% in terms of accuracy."
Graph LSTM with Context-Gated Mechanism for Spoken Language Understanding,"Much research in recent years has focused on spoken language understanding (SLU), which usually involves two tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Since Yao et al.(2013), almost all SLU systems are RNN-based, which have been shown to suffer various limitations due to their sequential nature. In this paper, we propose to tackle this task with Graph LSTM, which first converts text into a graph and then utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn the node representation. Not only the Graph LSTM addresses the limitations of sequential models, but it can also help to utilize the semantic correlation between slot and intent. We further propose a context-gated mechanism to make better use of context information for slot filling. Our extensive evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art results by a large margin."
Exploiting Cross-Lingual Subword Similarities in Low-Resource Document Classification,"Text classification must sometimes be applied in a low-resource language with no labeled training data. However, training data may be available in a related language. We investigate whether character-level knowledge transfer from a related language helps text classification. We present a cross-lingual document classification framework (caco) that exploits cross-lingual subword similarity by jointly training a character-based embedder and a word-based classifier. The embedder derives vector representations for input words from their written forms, and the classifier makes predictions based on the word vectors. We use a joint character representation for both the source language and the target language, which allows the embedder to generalize knowledge about source language words to target language words with similar forms. We propose a multi-task objective that can further improve the model if additional cross-lingual or monolingual resources are available. Experiments confirm that character-level knowledge transfer is more data-efficient than word-level transfer between related languages."
Structure Learning for Headline Generation,"Headline generation is an important problem in natural language processing, which aims to describe a document by a compact and informative headline. Some recent successes on this task have been achieved by advanced graph-based neural models, which marry the representational power of deep neural networks with the structural modeling ability of the relational sentence graphs. The advantages of graph-based neural models over traditional Seq2Seq models lie in that they can encode long-distance relationship between sentences beyond the surface linear structure. However, since documents are typically weakly-structured data, modern graph-based neural models usually rely on manually designed rules or some heuristics to construct the sentence graph a prior. This may largely limit the power and increase the cost of the graph-based methods. In this paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate structure learning into the graph-based neural models for headline generation. That is, we want to automatically learn the sentence graph using a data-driven way, so that we can unveil the document structure flexibly without prior heuristics or rules. To achieve this goal, we employ a deep & wide network to encode rich relational information between sentences for the sentence graph learning. For the deep component, we leverage neural matching models, either representation-focused or interaction-focused model, to learn semantic similarity between sentences. For the wide component, we encode a variety of discourse relations between sentences. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is then applied over the sentence graph to generate high-level relational representations for headline generation. The whole model could be optimized end-to-end so that the structure and representation could be learned jointly. Empirical studies show that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art headline generation models."
DCMN+: Dual Co-Matching Network for Multi-Choice Reading Comprehension,"Multi-choice reading comprehension is a challenging task to select an answer from a set of candidate options when given passage and question. Previous approaches usually only calculate question-aware passage representation and ignore passage-aware question representation when modeling the relationship between passage and question, which cannot effectively capture the relationship between passage and question. In this work, we propose dual co-matching network (DCMN) which models the relationship among passage, question and answer options bidirectionally. Besides, inspired by how humans solve multi-choice questions, we integrate two reading strategies into our model: (i) passage sentence selection that finds the most salient supporting sentences to answer the question, (ii) answer option interaction that encodes the comparison information between answer options. DCMN equipped with the two strategies (DCMN+) obtains state-of-the-art results on five multi-choice reading comprehension datasets from different domains: RACE, SemEval-2018 Task 11, ROCStories, COIN, MCTest."
Learning Long- and Short-Term User Literal-Preference with Multimodal Hierarchical Transformer Network for Personalized Image Caption,"Personalized image caption, a natural extension of the standard image caption task, requires to generate brief image descriptions tailored for users' writing style and traits, and is more practical to meet users' real demands. Only a few recent studies shed light on this crucial task and learn static user representations to capture their long-term literal-preference. However, it is insufficient to achieve satisfactory performance due to the intrinsic existence of not only long-term user literal-preference, but also short-term literal-preference which is associated with users' recent states. To bridge this gap, we develop a novel multimodal hierarchical transformer network (MHTN) for personalized image caption in this paper. It learns short-term user literal-preference based on users' recent captions through a short-term user encoder at the low level. And at the high level, the multimodal encoder integrates target image representations with short-term literal-preference, as well as long-term literal-preference learned from user IDs. These two encoders enjoy the advantages of the powerful transformer networks. Extensive experiments on two real datasets show the effectiveness of considering two types of user literal-preference simultaneously and better performance over the state-of-the-art models."
Learning Conceptual-Contextual Embeddings for Medical Text,"External knowledge is often useful for natural language understanding tasks. We introduce a contextual text representation model called Conceptual-Contextual (CC) embeddings, which incorporates structured knowledge into text representations. Unlike entity embedding methods, our approach encodes a knowledge graph into a context model. CC embeddings can be easily reused for a wide range of tasks in a similar fashion to pre-trained language models. Our model effectively encodes the huge UMLS database by leveraging semantic generalizability. Experiments on electronic health records (EHRs) and medical text processing benchmarks showed our model gives a major boost to the performance of supervised medical NLP tasks."
Filling Conversation Ellipsis for Better Social Dialog Understanding,"The phenomenon of ellipsis is prevalent in social conversations. Ellipsis increases the difficulty of a series of downstream language understanding tasks, such as dialog act prediction and semantic role labeling. We propose to resolve ellipsis through automatic sentence completion to improve language understanding. However, automatic ellipsis completion can result in output which does not accurately reflect user intent. To address this issue, we propose a method which considers both the original utterance that has ellipsis and the automatically completed utterance in dialog act and semantic role labeling tasks. Specifically, we first complete user utterances to resolve ellipsis using an end-to-end pointer network model. We then train a prediction model using both utterances containing ellipsis and our automatically completed utterances. Finally, we combine the prediction results from these two utterances using a selection model that is guided by expert knowledge. Our approach improves dialog act prediction and semantic role labeling by 1.3% and 2.5% in F1 score respectively in social conversations. We also present an open-domain human-machine conversation dataset with manually completed user utterances and annotated semantic role labeling after manual completion."
CFGNN: Cross Flow Graph Neural Networks for Question Answering on Complex Tables,"Question answering on complex tables is a challenging task for machines. In the Spider, a large-scale complex table dataset, relationships between tables and columns can be easily modeled as graph. But most of graph neural networks (GNNs) ignore the relationship of sibling nodes and use summation as aggregation function to model the relationship of parent-child nodes. It may cause nodes with less degrees, like column nodes in schema graph, to obtain little information. And the context information is important for natural language. To leverage more context information flow comprehensively, we propose novel cross flow graph neural networks in this paper. The information flows of parent-child and sibling nodes cross with history states between different layers. Besides, we use hierarchical encoding layer to obtain contextualized representation in tables. Experiments on the Spider show that our approach achieves substantial performance improvement comparing with previous GNN models and their variants."
Task-Oriented Dialog Systems That Consider Multiple Appropriate Responses under the Same Context,"Conversations have an intrinsic one-to-many property, which means that multiple responses can be appropriate for the same dialog context. In task-oriented dialogs, this property leads to different valid dialog policies towards task completion. However, none of the existing task-oriented dialog generation approaches takes this property into account. We propose a Multi-Action Data Augmentation (MADA) framework to utilize the one-to-many property to generate diverse appropriate dialog responses. Specifically, we first use dialog states to summarize the dialog history, and then discover all possible mappings from every dialog state to its different valid system actions. During dialog system training, we enable the current dialog state to map to all valid system actions discovered in the previous process to create additional state-action pairs. By incorporating these additional pairs, the dialog policy learns a balanced action distribution, which further guides the dialog model to generate diverse responses. Experimental results show that the proposed framework consistently improves dialog policy diversity, and results in improved response diversity and appropriateness. Our model obtains state-of-the-art results on MultiWOZ."
Relational Graph Neural Network with Hierarchical Attention for Knowledge Graph Completion,"The rapid proliferation of knowledge graphs (KGs) has changed the paradigm for various AI-related applications. Despite their large sizes, modern KGs are far from complete and comprehensive. This has motivated the research in knowledge graph completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing values in incomplete knowledge triples. However, most existing KGC models treat the triples in KGs independently without leveraging the inherent and valuable information from the local neighborhood surrounding an entity. To this end, we propose a Relational Graph neural network with Hierarchical ATtention (RGHAT) for the KGC task. The proposed model is equipped with a two-level attention mechanism: (i) the first level is the relation-level attention, which is inspired by the intuition that different relations have different weights for indicating an entity; (ii) the second level is the entity-level attention, which enables our model to highlight the importance of different neighboring entities under the same relation. The hierarchical attention mechanism makes our model more effective to utilize the neighborhood information of an entity. Finally, we extensively validate the superiority of RGHAT against various state-of-the-art baselines."
Distilling Knowledge from Well-Informed Soft Labels for Neural Relation Extraction,"Extracting relations from plain text is an important task with wide application. Most existing methods formulate it as a supervised problem and utilize one-hot hard labels as the sole target in training, neglecting the rich semantic information among relations. In this paper, we aim to explore the supervision with soft labels in relation extraction, which makes it possible to integrate prior knowledge. Specifically, a bipartite graph is first devised to discover type constraints between entities and relations based on the entire corpus. Then, we combine such type constraints with neural networks to achieve a knowledgeable model. Furthermore, this model is regarded as teacher to generate well-informed soft labels and guide the optimization of a student network via knowledge distillation. Besides, a multi-aspect attention mechanism is introduced to help student mine latent information from text. In this way, the enhanced student inherits the dark knowledge (e.g., type constraints and relevance among relations) from teacher, and directly serves the testing scenarios without any extra constraints. We conduct extensive experiments on the TACRED and SemEval datasets, the experimental results justify the effectiveness of our approach."
Semantics-Aware BERT for Language Understanding,"The latest work on language representations carefully integrates contextualized features into language model training, which enables a series of success especially in various machine reading comprehension and natural language inference tasks. However, the existing language representation models including ELMo, GPT and BERT only exploit plain context-sensitive features such as character or word embeddings. They rarely consider incorporating structured semantic information which can provide rich semantics for language representation. To promote natural language understanding, we propose to incorporate explicit contextual semantics from pre-trained semantic role labeling, and introduce an improved language representation model, Semantics-aware BERT (SemBERT), which is capable of explicitly absorbing contextual semantics over a BERT backbone. SemBERT keeps the convenient usability of its BERT precursor in a light fine-tuning way without substantial task-specific modifications. Compared with BERT, semantics-aware BERT is as simple in concept but more powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art or substantially improves results on ten reading comprehension and language inference tasks."
SG-Net: Syntax-Guided Machine Reading Comprehension,"For machine reading comprehension, the capacity of effectively modeling the linguistic knowledge from the detail-riddled and lengthy passages and getting ride of the noises is essential to improve its performance. Traditional attentive models attend to all words without explicit constraint, which results in inaccurate concentration on some dispensable words. In this work, we propose using syntax to guide the text modeling by incorporating explicit syntactic constraints into attention mechanism for better linguistically motivated word representations. In detail, for self-attention network (SAN) sponsored Transformer-based encoder, we introduce syntactic dependency of interest (SDOI) design into the SAN to form an SDOI-SAN with syntax-guided self-attention. Syntax-guided network (SG-Net) is then composed of this extra SDOI-SAN and the SAN from the original Transformer encoder through a dual contextual architecture for better linguistics inspired representation. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed SG-Net is applied to typical pre-trained language model BERT which is right based on a Transformer encoder. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks including SQuAD 2.0 and RACE show that the proposed SG-Net design helps achieve substantial performance improvement over strong baselines."
Weakly-Supervised Opinion Summarization by Leveraging External Information,"Opinion summarization from online product reviews is a challenging task, which involves identifying opinions related to various aspects of the product being reviewed. While previous works require additional human effort to identify relevant aspects, we instead apply domain knowledge from external sources to automatically achieve the same goal. This work proposes AspMem, a generative method that contains an array of memory cells to store aspect-related knowledge. This explicit memory can help obtain a better opinion representation and infer the aspect information more precisely. We evaluate this method on both aspect identification and opinion summarization tasks. Our experiments show that AspMem outperforms the state-of-the-art methods even though, unlike the baselines, it does not rely on human supervision which is carefully handcrafted for the given tasks."
Reinforced Curriculum Learning on Pre-Trained Neural Machine Translation Models,"The competitive performance of neural machine translation (NMT) critically relies on large amounts of training data. However, acquiring high-quality translation pairs requires expert knowledge and is costly. Therefore, how to best utilize a given dataset of samples with diverse quality and characteristics becomes an important yet understudied question in NMT. Curriculum learning methods have been introduced to NMT to optimize a model's performance by prescribing the data input order, based on heuristics such as the assessment of noise and difficulty levels. However, existing methods require training from scratch, while in practice most NMT models are pre-trained on big data already. Moreover, as heuristics, they do not generalize well. In this paper, we aim to learn a curriculum for improving a pre-trained NMT model by re-selecting influential data samples from the original training set and formulate this task as a reinforcement learning problem. Specifically, we propose a data selection framework based on Deterministic Actor-Critic, in which a critic network predicts the expected change of model performance due to a certain sample, while an actor network learns to select the best sample out of a random batch of samples presented to it. Experiments on several translation datasets show that our method can further improve the performance of NMT when original batch training reaches its ceiling, without using additional new training data, and significantly outperforms several strong baseline methods."
Balancing Quality and Human Involvement: An Effective Approach to Interactive Neural Machine Translation,"Conventional interactive machine translation typically requires a human translator to validate every generated target word, even though most of them are correct in the advanced neural machine translation (NMT) scenario. Previous studies have exploited confidence approaches to address the intensive human involvement issue, which request human guidance only for a few number of words with low confidences. However, such approaches do not take the history of human involvement into account, and optimize the models only for the translation quality while ignoring the cost of human involvement. In response to these pitfalls, we propose a novel interactive NMT model, which explicitly accounts the history of human involvements and particularly is optimized towards two objectives corresponding to the translation quality and the cost of human involvement, respectively. Specifically, the model jointly predicts a target word and a decision on whether to request human guidance, which is based on both the partial translation and the history of human involvements. Since there is no explicit signals on the decisions of requesting human guidance in the bilingual corpus, we optimize the model with the reinforcement learning technique which enables our model to accurately predict when to request human guidance. Simulated and real experiments show that the proposed model can achieve higher translation quality with similar or less human involvement over the confidence-based baseline."
Semi-Supervised Text Simplification with Back-Translation and Asymmetric Denoising Autoencoders,"Text simplification (TS) rephrases long sentences into simplified variants while preserving inherent semantics. Traditional sequence-to-sequence models heavily rely on the quantity and quality of parallel sentences, which limits their applicability in different languages and domains. This work investigates how to leverage large amounts of unpaired corpora in TS task. We adopt the back-translation architecture in unsupervised machine translation (NMT), including denoising autoencoders for language modeling and automatic generation of parallel data by iterative back-translation. However, it is non-trivial to generate appropriate complex-simple pair if we directly treat the set of simple and complex corpora as two different languages, since the two types of sentences are quite similar and it is hard for the model to capture the characteristics in different types of sentences. To tackle this problem, we propose asymmetric denoising methods for sentences with separate complexity. When modeling simple and complex sentences with autoencoders, we introduce different types of noise into the training process. Such a method can significantly improve the simplification performance. Our model can be trained in both unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. Automatic and human evaluations show that our unsupervised model outperforms the previous systems, and with limited supervision, our model can perform competitively with multiple state-of-the-art simplification systems."
Dynamic Reward-Based Dueling Deep Dyna-Q: Robust Policy Learning in Noisy Environments,"Task-oriented dialogue systems provide a convenient interface to help users complete tasks. An important consideration for task-oriented dialogue systems is the ability to against the noise commonly existed in the real-world conversation. Both rule-based strategies and statistical modeling techniques can solve noise problems, but they are costly. In this paper, we propose a new approach, called Dynamic Reward-based Dueling Deep Dyna-Q (DR-D3Q). The DR-D3Q can learn policies in noise robustly, and it is easy to implement by combining dynamic reward and the Dueling Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN) into Deep Dyna-Q (DDQ) framework. The Dueling DQN can mitigate the negative impact of noise on learning policies, but it is inapplicable to dialogue domain due to different reward mechanisms. Unlike typical dialogue reward function, we integrate dynamic reward that provides reward in real-time for agent to make Dueling DQN adapt to dialogue domain. For the purpose of supplementing the limited amount of real user experiences, we take the DDQ framework as the basic framework. Experiments using simulation and human evaluation show that the DR-D3Q significantly improve the performance of policy learning tasks in noisy environments.1"
"Replicate, Walk, and Stop on Syntax: An Effective Neural Network Model for Aspect-Level Sentiment Classification","Aspect-level sentiment classification (ALSC) aims at predicting the sentiment polarity of a specific aspect term occurring in a sentence. This task requires learning a representation by aggregating the relevant contextual features concerning the aspect term. Existing methods cannot sufficiently leverage the syntactic structure of the sentence, and hence are difficult to distinguish different sentiments for multiple aspects in a sentence. We perceive the limitations of the previous methods and propose a hypothesis about finding crucial contextual information with the help of syntactic structure. For this purpose, we present a neural network model named RepWalk which performs a replicated random walk on a syntax graph, to effectively focus on the informative contextual words. Empirical studies show that our model outperforms recent models on most of the benchmark datasets for the ALSC task. The results suggest that our method for incorporating syntactic structure enriches the representation for the classification."
A Pre-Training Based Personalized Dialogue Generation Model with Persona-Sparse Data,"Endowing dialogue systems with personas is essential to deliver more human-like conversations. However, this problem is still far from well explored due to the difficulties of both embodying personalities in natural languages and the persona sparsity issue observed in most dialogue corpora. This paper proposes a pre-training based personalized dialogue model that can generate coherent responses using persona-sparse dialogue data. In this method, a pre-trained language model is used to initialize an encoder and decoder, and personal attribute embeddings are devised to model richer dialogue contexts by encoding speakers' personas together with dialogue histories. Further, to incorporate the target persona in the decoding process and to balance its contribution, an attention routing structure is devised in the decoder to merge features extracted from the target persona and dialogue contexts using dynamically predicted weights. Our model can utilize persona-sparse dialogues in a unified manner during the training process, and can also control the amount of persona-related features to exhibit during the inference process. Both automatic and manual evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for generating more coherent and persona consistent responses with persona-sparse data."
JEC-QA: A Legal-Domain Question Answering Dataset,"We present JEC-QA, the largest question answering dataset in the legal domain, collected from the National Judicial Examination of China. The examination is a comprehensive evaluation of professional skills for legal practitioners. College students are required to pass the examination to be certified as a lawyer or a judge. The dataset is challenging for existing question answering methods, because both retrieving relevant materials and answering questions require the ability of logic reasoning. Due to the high demand of multiple reasoning abilities to answer legal questions, the state-of-the-art models can only achieve about 28% accuracy on JEC-QA, while skilled humans and unskilled humans can reach 81% and 64% accuracy respectively, which indicates a huge gap between humans and machines on this task. We will release JEC-QA and our baselines to help improve the reasoning ability of machine comprehension models. You can access the dataset from http://jecqa.thunlp.org/."
Discourse Level Factors for Sentence Deletion in Text Simplification,"This paper presents a data-driven study focusing on analyzing and predicting sentence deletion — a prevalent but understudied phenomenon in document simplification — on a large English text simplification corpus. We inspect various document and discourse factors associated with sentence deletion, using a new manually annotated sentence alignment corpus we collected. We reveal that professional editors utilize different strategies to meet readability standards of elementary and middle schools. To predict whether a sentence will be deleted during simplification to a certain level, we harness automatically aligned data to train a classification model. Evaluated on our manually annotated data, our best models reached F1 scores of 65.2 and 59.7 for this task at the levels of elementary and middle school, respectively. We find that discourse level factors contribute to the challenging task of predicting sentence deletion for simplification."
Learning to Compare for Better Training and Evaluation of Open Domain Natural Language Generation Models,"Automated evaluation of open domain natural language generation (NLG) models remains a challenge and widely used metrics such as BLEU and Perplexity can be misleading in some cases. In our paper, we propose to evaluate natural language generation models by learning to compare a pair of generated sentences by fine-tuning BERT, which has been shown to have good natural language understanding ability. We also propose to evaluate the model-level quality of NLG models with sample-level comparison results with skill rating system. While able to be trained in a fully self-supervised fashion, our model can be further fine-tuned with a little amount of human preference annotation to better imitate human judgment. In addition to evaluating trained models, we propose to apply our model as a performance indicator during training for better hyperparameter tuning and early-stopping. We evaluate our approach on both story generation and chit-chat dialogue response generation. Experimental results show that our model correlates better with human preference compared with previous automated evaluation approaches. Training with the proposed metric yields better performance in human evaluation, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model."
Co-Attention Hierarchical Network: Generating Coherent Long Distractors for Reading Comprehension,"In reading comprehension, generating sentence-level distractors is a significant task, which requires a deep understanding of the article and question. The traditional entity-centered methods can only generate word-level or phrase-level distractors. Although recently proposed neural-based methods like sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model show great potential in generating creative text, the previous neural methods for distractor generation ignore two important aspects. First, they didn't model the interactions between the article and question, making the generated distractors tend to be too general or not relevant to question context. Second, they didn't emphasize the relationship between the distractor and article, making the generated distractors not semantically relevant to the article and thus fail to form a set of meaningful options. To solve the first problem, we propose a co-attention enhanced hierarchical architecture to better capture the interactions between the article and question, thus guide the decoder to generate more coherent distractors. To alleviate the second problem, we add an additional semantic similarity loss to push the generated distractors more relevant to the article. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several strong baselines on automatic metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Further human evaluation indicates that our generated distractors are more coherent and more educative compared with those distractors generated by baselines."
Evaluating Commonsense in Pre-Trained Language Models,"Contextualized representations trained over large raw text data have given remarkable improvements for NLP tasks including question answering and reading comprehension. There have been works showing that syntactic, semantic and word sense knowledge are contained in such representations, which explains why they benefit such tasks. However, relatively little work has been done investigating commonsense knowledge contained in contextualized representations, which is crucial for human question answering and reading comprehension. We study the commonsense ability of GPT, BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa by testing them on seven challenging benchmarks, finding that language modeling and its variants are effective objectives for promoting models' commonsense ability while bi-directional context and larger training set are bonuses. We additionally find that current models do poorly on tasks require more necessary inference steps. Finally, we test the robustness of models by making dual test cases, which are correlated so that the correct prediction of one sample should lead to correct prediction of the other. Interestingly, the models show confusion on these test cases, which suggests that they learn commonsense at the surface rather than the deep level. We release a test set, named CATs publicly, for future research."
Who Did They Respond to? Conversation Structure Modeling Using Masked Hierarchical Transformer,"Conversation structure is useful for both understanding the nature of conversation dynamics and for providing features for many downstream applications such as summarization of conversations. In this work, we define the problem of conversation structure modeling as identifying the parent utterance(s) to which each utterance in the conversation responds to. Previous work usually took a pair of utterances to decide whether one utterance is the parent of the other. We believe the entire ancestral history is a very important information source to make accurate prediction. Therefore, we design a novel masking mechanism to guide the ancestor flow, and leverage the transformer model to aggregate all ancestors to predict parent utterances. Our experiments are performed on the Reddit dataset (Zhang, Culbertson, and Paritosh 2017) and the Ubuntu IRC dataset (Kummerfeld et al. 2019). In addition, we also report experiments on a new larger corpus from the Reddit platform and release this dataset. We show that the proposed model, that takes into account the ancestral history of the conversation, significantly outperforms several strong baselines including the BERT model on all datasets."
Multimodal Summarization with Guidance of Multimodal Reference,"Multimodal summarization with multimodal output (MSMO) is to generate a multimodal summary for a multimodal news report, which has been proven to effectively improve users' satisfaction. The existing MSMO methods are trained by the target of text modality, leading to the modality-bias problem that ignores the quality of model-selected image during training. To alleviate this problem, we propose a multimodal objective function with the guidance of multimodal reference to use the loss from the summary generation and the image selection. Due to the lack of multimodal reference data, we present two strategies, i.e., ROUGE-ranking and Order-ranking, to construct the multimodal reference by extending the text reference. Meanwhile, to better evaluate multimodal outputs, we propose a novel evaluation metric based on joint multimodal representation, projecting the model output and multimodal reference into a joint semantic space during evaluation. Experimental results have shown that our proposed model achieves the new state-of-the-art on both automatic and manual evaluation metrics. Besides, our proposed evaluation method can effectively improve the correlation with human judgments."
LATTE: Latent Type Modeling for Biomedical Entity Linking,"Entity linking is the task of linking mentions of named entities in natural language text, to entities in a curated knowledge-base. This is of significant importance in the biomedical domain, where it could be used to semantically annotate a large volume of clinical records and biomedical literature, to standardized concepts described in an ontology such as Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We observe that with precise type information, entity disambiguation becomes a straightforward task. However, fine-grained type information is usually not available in biomedical domain. Thus, we propose LATTE, a LATent Type Entity Linking model, that improves entity linking by modeling the latent fine-grained type information about mentions and entities. Unlike previous methods that perform entity linking directly between the mentions and the entities, LATTE jointly does entity disambiguation, and latent fine-grained type learning, without direct supervision. We evaluate our model on two biomedical datasets: MedMentions, a large scale public dataset annotated with UMLS concepts, and a de-identified corpus of dictated doctor's notes that has been annotated with ICD concepts. Extensive experimental evaluation shows our model achieves significant performance improvements over several state-of-the-art techniques."

Who Controls the Internet?: Analyzing Global Threats using Property Graph Traversals,"The Internet is built on top of intertwined network services, e.g., email, DNS, and content distribution networks operated by private or governmental organizations. Recent events have shown that these organizations may, knowingly or unknowingly, be part of global-scale security incidents including state-sponsored mass surveillance programs and large-scale DDoS attacks. For example, in March 2015 the Great Cannon attack has shown that an Internet service provider can weaponize millions of Web browsers and turn them into DDoS bots by injecting malicious JavaScript code into transiting TCP connections."
Tools for Automated Analysis of Cybercriminal Markets,"Underground forums are widely used by criminals to buy and sell a host of stolen items, datasets, resources, and criminal services. These forums contain important resources for understanding cybercrime. However, the number of forums, their size, and the domain expertise required to understand the markets makes manual exploration of these forums unscalable. In this work, we propose an automated, top-down approach for analyzing underground forums. Our approach uses natural language processing and machine learning to automatically generate high-level information about underground forums, first identifying posts related to transactions, and then extracting products and prices. We also demonstrate, via a pair of case studies, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to investigate other categories of products and transactions. We use eight distinct forums to assess our tools: Antichat, Blackhat World, Carders, Darkode, Hack Forums, Hell, L33tCrew and Nulled. Our automated approach is fast and accurate, achieving over 80% accuracy in detecting post category, product, and prices."
Tracking Phishing Attacks Over Time,"The so-called ``phishing'' attacks are one of the important threats to individuals and corporations in today's Internet. Combatting phishing is thus a top-priority, and has been the focus of much work, both on the academic and on the industry sides. In this paper, we look at this problem from a new angle. We have monitored a total of 19,066 phishing attacks over a period of ten months and found that over 90% of these attacks were actually replicas or variations of other attacks in the database. This provides several opportunities and insights for the fight against phishing: first, quickly and efficiently detecting replicas is a very effective prevention tool. We detail one such tool in this paper. Second, the widely held belief that phishing attacks are dealt with promptly is but an illusion. We have recorded numerous attacks that stay active throughout our observation period. This shows that the current prevention techniques are ineffective and need to be overhauled. We provide some suggestions in this direction. Third, our observation give a new perspective into the modus operandi of attackers. In particular, some of our observations suggest that a small group of attackers could be behind a large part of the current attacks. Taking down that group could potentially have a large impact on the phishing attacks observed today."
Security Challenges in an Increasingly Tangled Web,"Over the past 20 years, websites have grown increasingly complex and interconnected. In 2016, only a negligible number of sites are dependency free, and over 90% of sites rely on external content. In this paper, we investigate the current state of web dependencies and explore two security challenges associated with the increasing reliance on external services: (1) the expanded attack surface associated with serving unknown, implicitly trusted third-party content, and (2) how the increased set of external dependencies impacts HTTPS adoption. We hope that by shedding light on these issues, we can encourage developers to consider the security risks associated with serving third-party content and prompt service providers to more widely deploy HTTPS."

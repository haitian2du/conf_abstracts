Characterizing Email Search using Large-scale Behavioral Logs and Surveys,"As the number of email users and messages continues to grow, search is becoming more important for finding information in personal archives. In spite of its importance, email search is much less studied than web search, particularly using large-scale behavioral log analysis. In this paper we report the results of a large-scale log analysis of email search and complement this with a survey to better understand email search intent and success. We characterize email search behaviors and highlight differences from web search. When searching for email, people know many attributes about what they are looking for; they often look for specific known items; their queries are shorter and they click on fewer items than in web search. Although repeat queries are common in both email and web search, repeat visits to the same search result are much less common in email search suggesting that the same query is used for different search intents over time. We consider search intent from multiple angles. In email search logs, we find that people use email search not just to find information but also to perform tasks such as cleanup or organization, and that the distribution of actions they perform depends on the type of query. In our survey, people reported that they looked for specific information in both email search and web search, but they were much less likely to search for general information on a topic in email. The differences in overall behavior, re-finding patterns and search intents we observed between email and web search have important implications for the design of email search algorithms and interfaces."
Template Induction over Unstructured Email Corpora,"Unsupervised template induction over email data is a central component in applications such as information extraction, document classification, and auto-reply. The benefits of automatically generating such templates are known for structured data, e.g. machine generated HTML emails. However much less work has been done in performing the same task over unstructured email data."
Situational Context for Ranking in Personal Search,"Modern search engines leverage a variety of sources, beyond the conventional query-document content similarity, to improve their ranking performance. Among them, query context has attracted attention in prior work. Previously, query context was mainly modeled by user search history, either long-term or short-term, to help the ranking of future queries. In this paper, we focus on situational context, i.e., the contextual features of the current search request that are independent from both query content and user history. As an example, situational context can depend on search request time and location. We propose two context-aware ranking models based on neural networks. The first model learns a low-dimensional deep representation from the combination of contextual features. The second model extends the first one by leveraging binarized contextual features in addition to the high-level abstractions learned using a deep network."
The Demographics of Mail Search and their Application to Query Suggestion,"Web mail search is an emerging topic, which has not been the object of as many studies as traditional Web search. In particular, little is known about the characteristics of mail searchers and of the queries they issue. We study here the characteristics of Web mail searchers, and explore how demographic signals such as location, age, gender, and inferred income, influence their search behavior. We try to understand for instance, whether women exhibit different mail search patterns than men, or whether senior people formulate more precise queries than younger people. We compare our results, obtained from the analysis of a Yahoo Web mail search query log, to similar work conducted in Web and Twitter search. In addition, we demonstrate the value of the user's personal query log, as well as of the global query log and of the demographic signals, in a key search task: dynamic query auto-completion. We discuss how going beyond users' personal query logs (their search history) significantly improves the quality of suggestions, in spite of the fact that a user's mailbox is perceived as being highly personal. In particular, we note the striking value of demographic features for queries relating to companies/organizations, thus verifying our assumption that query completion benefits from leveraging queries issued by ``people like me"". We believe that demographics and other such global features can be leveraged in other mail applications, and hope that this work is a first step in this direction."
Promoting Relevant Results in Time-Ranked Mail Search,"Mail search has traditionally served time-ranked results, even if it has been shown that relevance ranking provides higher retrieval quality on average. Some Web mail services have recently started to provide relevance ranking options such as the relevance toggle in the search results page of Yahoo Mail, or the ``top results"" section in Inbox by Gmail. Yet, ranking results by relevance is not accepted by all, either in mail search, or in in other domains such as social media, where it has even triggered some public outcry. Given the sensitivity of the topic, we propose here to investigate a mixed approach of promoting the most relevant results, to which we refer as ``heroes'', on top of time-ranked results. We argue that this approach represents a good compromise to mail searchers, supporting on one hand the time sorted paradigm they are familiar with, while being almost as effective as full relevance ranking view that Web mail users seem to be reluctant to adopt. We describe three hero-selection algorithms we have devised and the associated experiments we have conducted in Yahoo mail. We measure retrieval success via two metrics: MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) and [email protected], and verify agreement between these metrics and users' direct feedback. We demonstrate that supplementing time-sorted results with hero results leads to a higher MRR than the traditional time-sorted view. We additionally show that MRR better reflects users' perception of quality than [email protected] Finally, we report on online results following the successful launch of one of our hero-selection algorithms for all Yahoo enterprise mail users and a few million Yahoo Web mail users."

Modeling Consumer Preferences and Price Sensitivities from Large-Scale Grocery Shopping Transaction Logs,"In order to match shoppers with desired products and provide personalized promotions, whether in online or offline shopping worlds, it is critical to model both consumer preferences and price sensitivities simultaneously. Personalized preferences have been thoroughly studied in the field of recommender systems, though price (and price sensitivity) has received relatively little attention. At the same time, price sensitivity has been richly explored in the area of economics, though typically not in the context of developing scalable, working systems to generate recommendations. In this study, we seek to bridge the gap between large-scale recommender systems and established consumer theories from economics, and propose a nested feature-based matrix factorization framework to model both preferences and price sensitivities. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate the proposed personalized, interpretable and scalable framework is capable of providing satisfying recommendations (on two datasets of grocery transactions) and can be applied to obtain economic insights into consumer behavior."
"Do ""Also-Viewed"" Products Help User Rating Prediction?","For online product recommendation engines, learning high-quality product embedding that captures various aspects of the product is critical to improving the accuracy of user rating prediction. In recent research, in conjunction with user feedback, the appearance of a product as side information has been shown to be helpful for learning product embedding. However, since a product has a variety of aspects such as functionality and specifications, taking into account only its appearance as side information does not suffice to accurately learn its embedding. In this paper, we propose a matrix co-factorization method that leverages information hidden in the so-called ""also-viewed"" products, i.e., a list of products that has also been viewed by users who have viewed a target product. ""Also-viewed"" products reflect various aspects of a given product that have been overlooked by visually-aware recommendation methods proposed in past research. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of user rating prediction. We also perform classification on the product embedding learned by our method, and compare it with a state-of-the-art baseline to demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating high-quality product embedding that better represents the product."
Monetary Discount Strategies for Real-Time Promotion Campaign,"The effectiveness of monetary promotions has been well reported in the literature to affect shopping decisions for products in real life experience. Nowadays, e-commerce retailers are facing more fierce competition on price promotion in that consumers can easily use a search engine to find another merchant selling an identical product for comparing price."
Predicting Latent Structured Intents from Shopping Queries,"In online shopping, users usually express their intent through search queries. However, these queries are often ambiguous. For example, it is more likely (and easier) for users to write a query like ""high-end bike"" than ""21 speed carbon frames jamis or giant road bike"". It is challenging to interpret these ambiguous queries and thus search result accuracy suffers. A user oftentimes needs to go through the frustrating process of refining search queries or self-teaching from possibly unstructured information. However, shopping is indeed a structured domain, that is composed of category hierarchy, brands, product lines, features, etc. It would be much better if a shopping site could understand users' intent through this structure, present organized information, and then find the items with the right categories, brands or features."

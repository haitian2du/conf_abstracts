Learning Personalized Preference of Strong and Weak Ties for Social Recommendation,"Recent years have seen a surge of research on social recommendation techniques for improving recommender systems due to the growing influence of social networks to our daily life. The intuition of social recommendation is that users tend to show affinities with items favored by their social ties due to social influence. Despite the extensive studies, no existing work has attempted to distinguish and learn the personalized preferences between strong and weak ties, two important terms widely used in social sciences, for each individual in social recommendation. In this paper, we first highlight the importance of different types of ties in social relations originated from social sciences, and then propose anovel social recommendation method based on a new Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model that incorporates the distinction of strong and weak ties for improving recommendation performance. The proposed method is capable of simultaneously classifying different types of social ties in a social network w.r.t. optimal recommendation accuracy, and learning a personalized tie type preference for each user in addition to other parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets by comparing our method with state-of-the-art approaches, and find encouraging results that validate the efficacy of the proposed method in exploiting the personalized preferences of strong and weak ties for social recommendation."
Cross View Link Prediction by Learning Noise-resilient Representation Consensus,"Link Prediction has been an important task for social and information networks. Existing approaches usually assume the completeness of network structure. However, in many real-world networks, the links and node attributes can usually be partially observable. In this paper, we study the problem of Cross View Link Prediction (CVLP) on partially observable networks, where the focus is to recommend nodes with only links to nodes with only attributes (or vice versa). We aim to bridge the information gap by learning a robust consensus for link-based and attribute-based representations so that nodes become comparable in the latent space. Also, the link-based and attribute-based representations can lend strength to each other via this consensus learning. Moreover, attribute selection is performed jointly with the representation learning to alleviate the effect of noisy high-dimensional attributes. We present two instantiations of this framework with different loss functions and develop an alternating optimization framework to solve the problem. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline methods significantly for cross-view link prediction."
Semi-supervised Clustering in Attributed Heterogeneous Information Networks,"A heterogeneous information network (HIN) is one whose nodes model objects of different types and whose links model objects' relationships. In many applications, such as social networks and RDF-based knowledge bases, information can be modeled as HINs. To enrich its information content, objects (as represented by nodes) in an HIN are typically associated with additional attributes. We call such an HIN an Attributed HIN or AHIN. We study the problem of clustering objects in an AHIN, taking into account objects' similarities with respect to both object attribute values and their structural connectedness in the network. We show how supervision signal, expressed in the form of a must-link set and a cannot-link set, can be leveraged to improve clustering results. We put forward the SCHAIN algorithm to solve the clustering problem. We conduct extensive experiments comparing SCHAIN with other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and show that SCHAIN outperforms the others in clustering quality."
An Efficient Approach to Event Detection and Forecasting in Dynamic Multivariate Social Media Networks,"Anomalous subgraph detection has been successfully applied to event detection in social media. However, the subgraph detection problembecomes challenging when the social media network incorporates abundant attributes, which leads to a multivariate network. The multivariate characteristic makes most existing methods incapable to tackle this problem effectively and efficiently, as it involves joint feature selection and subgraph detection that has not been well addressed in the current literature, especially, in the dynamic multivariate networks in which attributes evolve over time."

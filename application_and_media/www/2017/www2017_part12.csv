Exploring HTTP Header Manipulation In-The-Wild,"Headers are a critical part of HTTP, and it has been shown that they are increasingly subject to middlebox manipulation. Although this is well known, little is understood about the general regional and network trends that underpin these manipulations. In this paper, we collect data on thousands of networks to understand how they intercept HTTP headers in-the-wild. Our analysis reveals that 25% of measured ASes modify HTTP headers. Beyond this, we witness distinct trends among different regions and AS types; e.g., we observe high numbers of cache headers in poorly connected regions. Finally, we perform an in-depth analysis of the types of manipulations and how they differ across regions."
Push or Request: An Investigation of HTTP/2 Server Push for Improving Mobile Performance,"In HTTP/1.1, it is necessary for the client to request an object (e.g. an image in a page) in order for the server to send it, even if the server knows in advance what the client will need. Server Push is a feature introduced in HTTP/2 that promises to improve page load times (PLT) by having the server push content to the browser in advance. In this paper, we investigate the benefits and challenges of using Server Push on mobile devices. We first examine whether pushing all content or just the CSS and Javascript files performs better, and find the former leads to much better web performance. Also, we find that sites making use of domain sharding or which otherwise have content divided across many servers do not benefit much from Server Push, a major challenge for Server Push going forward. Network performance characteristics also play a major role. Server Push is especially effective at improving performance at high loss rates (16% median PLT reduction with a 2% loss rate) and high latencies (14% PLT reduction with 100 ms latency), and has little benefit for high-speed Ethernet connections. This motivates its use on mobile devices, although we also find the limited processing power of these devices limits the benefits of Server Push. Server Push also offers modest energy benefits, with energy savings of 9% on LTE for one device. Overall, Server Push is a promising approach for improving web performance in mobile networks, but there are a number of challenges in achieving the full benefits of Server Push."
Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis for Cloud-hosted Web Applications,"In this paper, we describe Roots - a system for automatically identifying the ""root cause"" of performance anomalies in web applications deployed in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds. Roots does not require application-level instrumentation. Instead, it tracks events within the PaaS cloud that are triggered by application requests using a combination of metadata injection and platform-level instrumentation."
BOAT: Building Auto-Tuners with Structured Bayesian Optimization,"Due to their complexity, modern systems expose many configuration parameters which users must tune to maximize performance. Auto-tuning has emerged as an alternative in which a black-box optimizer iteratively evaluates configurations to find efficient ones. Unfortunately, for many systems, such as distributed systems, evaluating performance takes too long and the space of configurations is too large for the optimizer to converge within a reasonable time."

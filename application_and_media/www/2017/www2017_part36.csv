ESCAPE: Efficiently Counting All 5-Vertex Subgraphs,"Counting the frequency of small subgraphs is a fundamental technique in network analysis across various domains, most notably in bioinformatics and social networks. The special case of triangle counting has received much attention. Getting results for 4-vertex or 5-vertex patterns is highly challenging, and there are few practical results known that can scale to massive sizes."
The k-peak Decomposition: Mapping the Global Structure of Graphs,"The structure of real-world complex networks has long been an area of interest, and one common way to describe the structure of a network has been with the k-core decomposition. The core number of a node can be thought of as a measure of its centrality and importance, and is used by applications such as community detection, understanding viral spreads, and detecting fraudsters. However, we observe that the k-core decomposition suffers from an important flaw: namely, it is calculated globally, and so if the network contains distinct regions of different densities, the sparser among these regions may be neglected."
Scalable Motif-aware Graph Clustering,"We develop new methods based on graph motifs for graph clustering, allowing more efficient detection of communities within networks. We focus on triangles within graphs, but our techniques extend to other clique motifs as well. Our intuition, which has been suggested but not formalized similarly in previous works, is that triangles are a better signature of community than edges. We therefore generalize the notion of conductance for a graph to triangle conductance, where the edges are weighted according to the number of triangles containing the edge. This methodology allows us to develop variations of several existing clustering techniques, including spectral clustering, that minimize triangles split by the cluster instead of edges cut by the cluster. We provide theoretical results in a planted partition model to demonstrate the potential for triangle conductance in clustering problems. We then show experimentally the effectiveness of our methods to multiple applications in machine learning and graph mining."
Indexing Public-Private Graphs,"We consider the reachability indexing problem for private-public directed graphs. In these graphs nodes come in three flavors: public--nodes visible to all users, private--nodes visible to a specific set of users, and protected--nodes visible to any user who can see at least one of the node's parents. We are interested in computing the set of nodes visible to a specific user online. There are two obvious algorithms: precompute the result for every user, or run a reachability algorithm at query time. This paper explores the trade-off between these two strategies."

Neural Collaborative Filtering,"In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation --- collaborative filtering --- on the basis of implicit feedback."
Learning to Recommend Accurate and Diverse Items,"In this study, we investigate diversified recommendation problem by supervised learning, seeking significant improvement in diversity while maintaining accuracy. In particular, we regard each user as a training instance, and heuristically choose a subset of accurate and diverse items as ground-truth for each user. We then represent each user or item as a vector resulted from the factorization of the user-item rating matrix. In our paper, we try to discover a factorization for matching the following supervised learning task. In doing this, we define two coupled optimization problems, parameterized matrix factorization and structural learning, to formulate our task. And we propose a diversified collaborative filtering algorithm (DCF) to solve the coupled problems. We also introduce a new pairwise accuracy metric and a normalized topic coverage diversity metric to measure the performance of accuracy and diversity respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the performance gains of DCF in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms."
Collaborative Metric Learning,"Metric learning algorithms produce distance metrics that capture the important relationships among data. In this work, we study the connection between metric learning and collaborative filtering. We propose Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) which learns a joint metric space to encode not only users' preferences but also the user-user and item-item similarity. The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms on a wide range of recommendation tasks and uncovers the underlying spectrum of users' fine-grained preferences. CML also achieves significant speedup for Top-K recommendation tasks using off-the-shelf, approximate nearest-neighbor search, with negligible accuracy reduction."
Beyond Globally Optimal: Focused Learning for Improved Recommendations,"When building a recommender system, how can we ensure that all items are modeled well? Classically, recommender systems are built, optimized, and tuned to improve a global prediction objective, such as root mean squared error. However, as we demonstrate, these recommender systems often leave many items badly-modeled and thus under-served. Further, we give both empirical and theoretical evidence that no single matrix factorization, under current state-of-the-art methods, gives optimal results for each item."

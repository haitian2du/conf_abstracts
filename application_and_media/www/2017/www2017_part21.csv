Constructing and Evaluating a Novel Crowdsourcing-based Paraphrased Opinion Spam Dataset,"Opinion spam, intentionally written by spammers who do not have actual experience with services or products, has recently become a factor that undermines the credibility of information online. In recent years, studies have attempted to detect opinion spam using machine learning algorithms. However, limitations of gold-standard spam datasets still prove to be a major obstacle in opinion spam research. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset called Paraphrased OPinion Spam (POPS), which contains a new type of review spam that imitates real human opinions using crowdsourcing. To create such a seemingly truthful review spam dataset, we asked task participants to paraphrase truthful reviews, and include factual information and domain knowledge in their reviews. The classification experiments and semantic analysis results show that our POPS dataset most linguistically and semantically resembles truthful reviews. We believe that our new deceptive opinion spam dataset will help advance opinion spam research."
Optimizing the Recency-Relevancy Trade-off in Online News Recommendations,"Online news media sites are emerging as the primary source of news for a large number of users. The selection of 'front-page' stories on these media sites usually takes into consideration several crowdsourced popularity metrics, such as number of views or shares by the readers. In this work, we focus on automatically recommending front-page stories in such media websites. When recommending news stories, there are two basic metrics of interest - recency and relevancy. Ideally, recommender systems should recommend the most relevant stories soon after they are published. However, the relevancy of a story only becomes evident as the story ages, thereby creating a tension between recency and relevancy. A systematic analysis of popular recommendation strategies in use today reveals that they lead to poor trade-offs between recency and relevancy in practice. So, in this paper, we propose a new recommendation strategy (called Highest Future-Impact) which attempts to optimize on both the axes. To implement our proposed strategy in practice, we develop an optimization framework combining the predicted future-impact of the stories with the uncertainties in the predictions. Evaluations over three real-world news datasets show that our implementation achieves good performance trade-offs between recency and relevancy."
Distilling Information Reliability and Source Trustworthiness from Digital Traces,"Online knowledge repositories typically rely on their users or dedicated editors to evaluate the reliability of their contents. These explicit feedback mechanisms can be viewed as noisy measurements of both information reliability and information source trustworthiness. Can we leverage these noisy measurements, often biased, to distill a robust, unbiased and interpretable measure of both notions?"
An Army of Me: Sockpuppets in Online Discussion Communities,"In online discussion communities, users can interact and share information and opinions on a wide variety of topics. However, some users may create multiple identities, or sockpuppets, and engage in undesired behavior by deceiving others or manipulating discussions. In this work, we study sockpuppetry across nine discussion communities, and show that sockpuppets differ from ordinary users in terms of their posting behavior, linguistic traits, as well as social network structure. Sockpuppets tend to start fewer discussions, write shorter posts, use more personal pronouns such as ``I'', and have more clustered ego-networks. Further, pairs of sockpuppets controlled by the same individual are more likely to interact on the same discussion at the same time than pairs of ordinary users. Our analysis suggests a taxonomy of deceptive behavior in discussion communities. Pairs of sockpuppets can vary in their deceptiveness, i.e., whether they pretend to be different users, or their supportiveness, i.e., if they support arguments of other sockpuppets controlled by the same user. We apply these findings to a series of prediction tasks, notably, to identify whether a pair of accounts belongs to the same underlying user or not. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of deception in online discussion communities and paves the way towards the automatic detection of sockpuppets."

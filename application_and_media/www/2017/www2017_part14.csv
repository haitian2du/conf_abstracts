Drawing Sound Conclusions from Noisy Judgments,"The quality of a search engine is typically evaluated using hand-labeled data sets, where the labels indicate the relevance of documents to queries. Often the number of labels needed is too large to be created by the best annotators, and so less accurate labels (e.g. from crowdsourcing) must be used. This introduces errors in the labels, and thus errors in standard precision metrics (such as [emailÂ protected] and DCG); the lower the quality of the judge, the more errorful the labels, consequently the more inaccurate the metric. We introduce equations and algorithms that can adjust the metrics to the values they would have had if there were no annotation errors."
Exploring Query Auto-Completion and Click Logs for Contextual-Aware Web Search and Query Suggestion,"Contextual data plays an important role in modeling search engine users' behaviors on both query auto-completion (QAC) log and normal query (click) log. User's recent search history on each log has been widely studied individually as the context to benefit the modeling of users' behaviors on that log. However, there is no existing work that explores or incorporates both logs together for contextual data. As QAC and click logs actually record users' sequential behaviors while interacting with a search engine, the available context of a user's current behavior based on the same type of log can be strengthened from the user's recent search history shown on the other type of log. Our paper proposes to model users' behaviors on both QAC and click logs simultaneously by utilizing both logs as the contextual data of each other. The key idea is to capture the correlation between users' behavior patterns on both logs. We model such correlation through a novel probabilistic model based on the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. The learned users' behavior patterns on both logs are utilized to address not only the application of query auto-completion on QAC logs, but also the click prediction and relevance ranking of web documents on click logs. Experiments on real-world logs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on both applications."
Web Search as a Linguistic Tool,"Many people rely on web search engines to check the spelling or grammatical correctness of input phrases. For example, one might search [recurring or reoccurring] to decide between these similar words. While language-related queries are common, they have low click-through rates, lack a strong intent signal, and are generally challenging to study. Perhaps for these reasons, they have yet to be characterized in the literature. In this paper we report the results of two surveys that investigate how, when, and why people use web search to support low-level, language-related tasks. The first survey was distributed by email, and asked participants to reflect on a recent search task. The second survey was embedded directly in search result pages, and captured information about searchers' intents in-situ. Our analysis confirms that language-related search tasks are indeed common, accounting for at least 2.7% of all queries posed by our respondents. Survey responses also reveal: (1) the range of language-related tasks people perform with search, (2) the contexts in which these tasks arise, and (3), the reasons why people elect to use web search rather than relying on traditional proofing tools (e.g., spelling and grammar checkers)."
Query Expansion Based on a Feedback Concept Model for Microblog Retrieval,"We tackle the problem of improving microblog retrieval algorithms by proposing a Feedback Concept Model for query expansion. In particular, we expand the query using knowledge information derived from Probase so that the expanded one could better reflect users' search intent, which allows for microblog retrieval at a concept-level, rather than term-level. In the proposed feedback concept model: (i) we mine the concept information implicit in short-texts based on the external knowledge bases; (ii) with the relevant concepts associated with short-texts, a mixture model is generated to estimate a concept language model; (iii) finally, we utilize the concept language model for query expansion. Moreover, we incorporate temporal prior into the proposed query expansion method to satisfy real-time information need. Finally, we test the generalization power of the feedback concept model on the TREC Microblog corpora. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the previous methods for microblog retrieval significantly."

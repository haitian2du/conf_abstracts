On Analyzing User Topic-Specific Platform Preferences Across Multiple Social Media Sites,"Topic modeling has traditionally been studied for single text collections and applied to social media data represented in the form of text documents. With the emergence of many social media platforms, users find themselves using different social media for posting content and for social interaction. While many topics may be shared across social media platforms, users typically show preferences of certain social media platform(s) over others for certain topics. Such platform preferences may even be found at the individual level. To model social media topics as well as platform preferences of users, we propose a new topic model known as MultiPlatform-LDA (MultiLDA). Instead of just merging all posts from different social media platforms into a single text collection, MultiLDA keeps one text collection for each social media platform but allowing these platforms to share a common set of topics. MultiLDA further learns the user-specific platform preferences for each topic. We evaluate MultiLDA against TwitterLDA, the state-of-the-art method for social media content modeling, on two aspects: (i) the effectiveness in modeling topics across social media platforms, and (ii) the ability to predict platform choices for each post. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets from Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr sharing a set of common users. Our experiments results show that the MultiLDA outperforms in both topic modeling and platform choice prediction tasks. We also show empirically that among the three social media platforms, ""Daily matters"" and ""Relationship matters"" are dominant topics in Twitter, ""Social gathering"", ""Outing"" and ""Fashion"" are dominant topics in Instagram, and ""Music"", ""Entertainment"" and ""Fashion"" are dominant topics in Tumblr."
Competition and Selection Among Conventions,"In many domains, a latent competition among different conventions determines which one will come to dominate. One sees such effects in the success of community jargon, of competing frames in political rhetoric, or of terminology in technical contexts. These effects have become widespread in the on-line domain, where the ease of information transmission makes them particularly forceful, and where the available data offers the potential to study competition among conventions at a fine-grained level."
Discussion Quality Diffuses in the Digital Public Square,"Studies of online social influence have demonstrated that friends have important effects on many types of behavior in a wide variety of settings. However, we know much less about how influence works among relative strangers in digital public squares, despite important conversations happening in such spaces. We present the results of a study on large public Facebook Pages where we randomly used two different methods---most recent and social feedback---to order comments on posts. We find that the social feedback condition results in higher quality viewed comments and response comments. After measuring the average quality of comments written by users before the study, we find that social feedback has a positive effect on response quality for both low and high quality commenters. We draw on a theoretical framework of social norms to explain this empirical result. In order to examine the influence mechanism further, we measure the similarity between comments viewed and written during the study, finding that similarity increases for the highest quality contributors under the social feedback condition. This suggests that, in addition to norms, some individuals may respond with increased relevance to high-quality comments."
When Confidence and Competence Collide: Effects on Online Decision-Making Discussions,"Group discussions are a way for individuals to exchange ideas and arguments in order to reach better decisions than they could on their own. One of the premises of productive discussions is that better solutions will prevail, and that the idea selection process is mediated by the (relative) competence of the individuals involved. However, since people may not know their actual competence on a new task, their behavior is influenced by their self-estimated competence -- that is, their confidence -- which can be misaligned with their actual competence."

Identifying Value in Crowdsourced Wireless Signal Measurements,"While crowdsourcing is an attractive approach to collect large-scale wireless measurements, understanding the quality and variance of the resulting data is difficult. Our work analyzes the quality of crowdsourced cellular signal measurements in the context of basestation localization, using large international public datasets (419M signal measurements and 1M cells) and corresponding ground truth values. Performing localization using raw received signal strength (RSS) data produces poor results and very high variance. Applying supervised learning improves results moderately, but variance remains high. Instead, we propose feature clustering, a novel application of unsupervised learning to detect hidden correlation between measurement instances, their features, and localization accuracy. Our results identify RSS standard deviation and RSS-weighted dispersion mean as key features that correlate with highly predictive measurement samples for both sparse and dense measurements respectively. Finally, we show how optimizing crowdsourcing measurements for these two features dramatically improves localization accuracy and reduces variance."
Collaborative Optimization for Collective Decision-making in Continuous Spaces,"Many societal decision problems lie in high-dimensional continuous spaces not amenable to the voting techniques common for their discrete or single-dimensional counterparts. These problems are typically discretized before running an election or decided upon through negotiation by representatives. We propose a meta-algorithm called Iterative Local Voting for collective decision-making in this setting, in which voters are sequentially sampled and asked to modify a candidate solution within some local neighborhood of its current value, as defined by a ball in some chosen norm. In general, such schemes do not converge, or, when they do, the resulting solution does not have a natural description."
Location Privacy-Preserving Task Allocation for Mobile Crowdsensing with Differential Geo-Obfuscation,"In traditional mobile crowdsensing applications, organizers need participants' precise locations for optimal task allocation, e.g., minimizing selected workers' travel distance to task locations. However, the exposure of their locations raises privacy concerns. Especially for those who are not eventually selected for any task, their location privacy is sacrificed in vain. Hence, in this paper, we propose a location privacy-preserving task allocation framework with geo-obfuscation to protect users' locations during task assignments. Specifically, we make participants obfuscate their reported locations under the guarantee of differential privacy, which can provide privacy protection regardless of adversaries' prior knowledge and without the involvement of any third-part entity. In order to achieve optimal task allocation with such differential geo-obfuscation, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem to minimize the expected travel distance of the selected workers under the constraint of differential privacy. Evaluation results on both simulation and real-world user mobility traces show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Particularly, our framework outperforms Laplace obfuscation, a state-of-the-art differential geo-obfuscation mechanism, by achieving 45% less average travel distance on the real-world data."
PaRE: A System for Personalized Route Guidance,"The turn-by-turn directions provided in existing navigation applications are exclusively derived from underlying road network topology information, i.e., the connectivity of edges to each other. Therefore, the turn-by-turn directions are simplified as metric translation of physical world (e.g. distance/time to turn) to spoken language. Such translation - that ignores human cognition of the geographic space - is often verbose and redundant for the drivers who have knowledge about the geographical areas. In this paper, we study a Personalized RoutE Guidance System dubbed PaRE - with which the goal is to generate more customized and intuitive directions based on user generated content. PaRE utilizes a wealth of user generated historical trajectory data to extract namely ""landmarks"" (e.g., point of interests or intersections) and frequently visited routes between them from the road network. The extracted information is used to obtain cognitive customized directions for each user. We formalize this task as a problem of finding the optimal partition for a given route that maximizes the familiarity while minimizing the number of segments in the partition, and propose two efficient algorithms to solve it. For empirical study, we apply our solution to both real and synthetic trajectory datasets to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of PaRE."

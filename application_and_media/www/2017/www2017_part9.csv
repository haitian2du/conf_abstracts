Reducing Latency by Eliminating Synchrony,"Drawing or dragging an object on a mobile device is annoying today because the latency is manifested spatially with an obvious gap between the touch point and the line head or dragged object. This work identifies the multiple synchronization points in the input to display path of modern mobile systems as a major source of latency, contributing about 30 ms to the overall latency."
"Almond: The Architecture of an Open, Crowdsourced, Privacy-Preserving, Programmable Virtual Assistant","This paper presents the architecture of Almond, an open, crowdsourced, privacy-preserving and programmable virtual assistant for online services and the Internet of Things (IoT). Included in Almond is Thingpedia, a crowdsourced public knowledge base of natural language interfaces and open APIs. Our proposal addresses four challenges in virtual assistant technology: generality, interoperability, privacy, and usability. Generality is addressed by crowdsourcing Thingpedia, while interoperability is provided by ThingTalk, a high-level domain-specific language that connects multiple devices or services via open APIs. For privacy, user credentials and user data are managed by our open-source ThingSystem, which can be run on personal phones or home servers. Finally, we address usability by providing a natural language interface, whose capability can be extended via training with the help of a menu-driven interface."
DeepSense: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Time-Series Mobile Sensing Data Processing,"Mobile sensing and computing applications usually require time-series inputs from sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Some applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of rotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models. Other applications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges. On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions. Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most robust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and heterogeneous user behaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that directly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization challenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile sensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global interactions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics. DeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks: car tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and user identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition, we show that DeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones and embedded devices thanks to its moderate energy consumption and low latency."
"Regions, Periods, Activities: Uncovering Urban Dynamics via Cross-Modal Representation Learning","With the ever-increasing urbanization process, systematically modeling people's activities in the urban space is being recognized as a crucial socioeconomic task. This task was nearly impossible years ago due to the lack of reliable data sources, yet the emergence of geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data sheds new light on it. Recently, there have been fruitful studies on discovering geographical topics from GTSM data. However, their high computational costs and strong distributional assumptions about the latent topics hinder them from fully unleashing the power of GTSM."

Inferring Individual Attributes from Search Engine Queries and Auxiliary Information,"Internet data has surfaced as a primary source for investigation of different aspects of human behavior. A crucial step in such studies is finding a suitable cohort (i.e., a set of users) that shares a common trait of interest to researchers. However, direct identification of users sharing this trait is often impossible, as the data available to researchers is usually anonymized to preserve user privacy. To facilitate research on specific topics of interest, especially in medicine, we introduce an algorithm for identifying a trait of interest in anonymous users. We illustrate how a small set of labeled examples, together with statistical information about the entire population, can be aggregated to obtain labels on unseen examples. We validate our approach using labeled data from the political domain."
Using Participatory Web-based Surveillance Data to Improve Seasonal Influenza Forecasting in Italy,"Traditional surveillance of seasonal influenza is generally affected by reporting lags of at least one week and by continuous revisions of the numbers initially released. As a consequence, influenza forecasts are often limited by the time required to collect new and accurate data. On the other hand, the availability of novel data streams for disease detection can help in overcoming these issues by capturing an additional surveillance signal that can be used to complement data collected by public health agencies. In this study, we investigate how combining both traditional and participatory Web-based surveillance data can provide accurate predictions for seasonal influenza in real-time fashion. To this aim, we use two data sources available in Italy from two different monitoring systems: traditional surveillance data based on sentinel doctors reports and digital surveillance data deriving from a participatory system that monitors the influenza activity through Internet-based surveys. We integrate such digital component in a linear autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model based on traditional surveillance data and evaluate its predictive ability over the course of four influenza seasons in Italy, from 2012-2013 to 2015-2016, for each of the four weekly time horizons. Our results show that by using data extracted from a Web-based participatory surveillance system, which are usually available one week in advance with respect to traditional surveillance, it is possible to obtain accurate weekly predictions of influenza activity at national level up to four weeks in advance. Compared to a model that is only based on data from sentinel doctors, our approach significantly improves real-time forecasts of influenza activity, by increasing the Pearson's correlation up to 30% and by reducing the Mean Absolute Error up to 43% for the four weekly time horizons."
Forecasting Seasonal Influenza Fusing Digital Indicators and a Mechanistic Disease Model,"The availability of novel digital data streams that can be used as proxy for monitoring infectious disease incidence is ushering in a new era for real-time forecast approaches to disease spreading. Here, we propose the first seasonal influenza forecast framework based on a stochastic, spatially structured mechanistic model (individual level microsimulation) initialized with geo-localized microblogging data. The framework provides for more than 600 census areas in the United States, Italy and Spain, the initial conditions for a stochastic epidemic computational model that generates an ensemble of forecasts for the main indicators of the epidemic season: peak time and intensity. We evaluate the forecasts accuracy and reliability by comparing the results with the data from the official influenza surveillance systems in the US, Italy and Spain in the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. In all countries studied, the proposed framework provides reliable results with leads of up to 6 weeks that became more stable and accurate with progression of the season. The results for the United States have been generated in real-time in the context of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ``Forecasting the Influenza Season Challenge''. A characteristic feature of the mechanistic modeling approach is in the explicit estimate of key epidemiological parameters relevant for public health decision-making that cannot be achieved with statistical models that do not consider the disease dynamic. Furthermore, the presented framework allows the fusion of multiple data streams in the initialization stage and can be enriched with census, weather and socioeconomic data."
PhLeGrA: Graph Analytics in Pharmacology over the Web of Life Sciences Linked Open Data,"Integrated approaches for pharmacology are required for the mechanism-based predictions of adverse drug reactions that manifest due to concomitant intake of multiple drugs. These approaches require the integration and analysis of biomedical data and knowledge from multiple, heterogeneous sources with varying schemas, entity notations, and formats. To tackle these integrative challenges, the Semantic Web community has published and linked several datasets in the Life Sciences Linked Open Data (LSLOD) cloud using established W3C standards. We present the PhLeGrA platform for Linked Graph Analytics in Pharmacology in this paper. Through query federation, we integrate four sources from the LSLOD cloud and extract a drug-reaction network, composed of distinct entities. We represent this graph as a hidden conditional random field (HCRF), a discriminative latent variable model that is used for structured output predictions. We calculate the underlying probability distributions in the drug-reaction HCRF using the datasets from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System. We predict the occurrence of 146 adverse reactions due to multiple drug intake with an AUROC statistic greater than 0.75. The PhLeGrA platform can be extended to incorporate other sources published using Semantic Web technologies, as well as to discover other types of pharmacological associations."

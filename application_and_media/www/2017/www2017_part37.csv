Pinning Down Abuse on Google Maps,"In this paper, we investigate a new form of blackhat search engine optimization that targets local listing services like Google Maps. Miscreants register abusive business listings in an attempt to siphon search traffic away from legitimate businesses and funnel it to deceptive service industries---such as unaccredited locksmiths---or to traffic-referral scams, often for the restaurant and hotel industry. In order to understand the prevalence and scope of this threat, we obtain access to over a hundred-thousand business listings on Google Maps that were suspended for abuse. We categorize the types of abuse affecting Google Maps; analyze how miscreants circumvented the protections against fraudulent business registration such as postcard mail verification; identify the volume of search queries affected; and ultimately explore how miscreants generated a profit from traffic that necessitates physical proximity to the victim. This physical requirement leads to unique abusive behaviors that are distinct from other online fraud such as pharmaceutical and luxury product scams."
Extended Tracking Powers: Measuring the Privacy Diffusion Enabled by Browser Extensions,"Users have come to rely on browser extensions to realize features that are not implemented by browser vendors. Extensions offer users the ability to, among others, block ads, de-clutter websites, enrich pages with third-party content, and take screenshots. At the same time, because of their privileged position inside a user's browser, extensions have access to content and functionality that is not available to webpages, such as, the ability to conduct and read cross-origin requests, as well as get access to a browser's history and cookie jar."
Security Implications of Redirection Trail in Popular Websites Worldwide,"URL redirection is a popular technique that automatically navigates users to an intended destination webpage with- out user awareness. However, such a seemingly advantageous feature may offer inadequate protection from security vulnerabilities unless every redirection is performed over HTTPS. Even worse, as long as the final redirection to a website is performed over HTTPS, the browser's URL bar indicates that the website is secure regardless of the security of prior redirections, which may provide users with a false sense of security. This paper reports a well-rounded investigation to analyze the wellness of URL redirection security. As an initial large-scale investigation, we screened the integrity and consistency of URL redirections for the Alexa top one million (1M) websites, and further examined 10,000 (10K) websites with their login features. Our results suggest that 1) the majority (83.3% in the 1M dataset and 78.6% in the 10K dataset) of redirection trails among web- sites that support only HTTPS are vulnerable to attacks, and 2) current incoherent practices (e.g., naked domains and www subdomains being redirected to different destinations with varying security levels) undermine the security guarantees provided by HTTPS and HSTS."
Some Recipes Can Do More Than Spoil Your Appetite: Analyzing the Security and Privacy Risks of IFTTT Recipes,"The use of end-user programming, such as if-this-then-that (IFTTT), is becoming increasingly common. Services like IFTTT allow users to easily create new functionality by connecting arbitrary Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and online services using simple if-then rules, commonly known as recipes. However, such convenience at times comes at the cost of security and privacy risks for end users. To gain an in-depth understanding of the potential security and privacy risks, we build an information-flow model to analyze how often IFTTT recipes involve potential integrity or secrecy violations. Our analysis finds that around 50% of the 19,323 unique recipes we examined are potentially unsafe, as they contain a secrecy violation, an integrity violation, or both. We next categorize the types of harm that these potentially unsafe recipes can cause to users. After manually examining a random selection of potentially unsafe recipes, we find that recipes can not only lead to harms such as personal embarrassment but can also be exploited by an attacker, e.g., to distribute malware or carry out denial-of-service attacks. The use of IoT devices and services like IFTTT is expected only to grow in the near future; our analysis suggests users need to be both informed about and protected from these emerging threats to which they could be unwittingly exposing themselves."

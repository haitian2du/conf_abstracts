Bimodal Distribution and Co-Bursting in Review Spam Detection,"Online reviews play a crucial role in helping consumers evaluate and compare products and services. This critical importance of reviews also incentivizes fraudsters (or spammers) to write fake or spam reviews to secretly promote or demote some target products and services. Existing approaches to detecting spam reviews and reviewers employed review contents, reviewer behaviors, star rating patterns, and reviewer-product networks for detection. In this research, we further discovered that reviewers' posting rates (number of reviews written in a period of time) also follow an interesting distribution pattern, which has not been reported before. That is, their posting rates are bimodal. Multiple spammers also tend to collectively and actively post reviews to the same set of products within a short time frame, which we call co-bursting. Furthermore, we found some other interesting patterns in individual reviewers' temporal dynamics and their co-bursting behaviors with other reviewers. Inspired by these findings, we first propose a two-mode Labeled Hidden Markov Model to model spamming using only individual reviewers' review posting times. We then extend it to the Coupled Hidden Markov Model to capture both reviewer posting behaviors and co-bursting signals. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in identifying individual spammers. Furthermore, we propose a co-bursting network based on co-bursting relations, which helps detect groups of spammers more effectively than existing approaches."
Detecting Collusive Spamming Activities in Community Question Answering,"Community Question Answering (CQA) portals provide rich sources of information on a variety of topics. However, the authenticity and quality of questions and answers (Q&As) has proven hard to control. In a troubling direction, the widespread growth of crowdsourcing websites has created a large-scale, potentially difficult-to-detect workforce to manipulate malicious contents in CQA. The crowd workers who join the same crowdsourcing task about promotion campaigns in CQA collusively manipulate deceptive Q&As for promoting a target (product or service). The collusive spamming group can fully control the sentiment of the target. How to utilize the structure and the attributes for detecting manipulated Q&As? How to detect the collusive group and leverage the group information for the detection task?"
FLOCK: Combating Astroturfing on Livestreaming Platforms,"Livestreaming platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years as a means of sharing and advertising creative content. Popular content streamers who attract large viewership to their live broadcasts can earn a living by means of ad revenue, donations and channel subscriptions. Unfortunately, this incentivized popularity has simultaneously resulted in incentive for fraudsters to provide services to astroturf, or artificially inflate viewership metrics by providing fake ``live'' views to customers. Our work provides a number of major contributions: (a) formulation: we are the first to introduce and characterize the viewbot fraud problem in livestreaming platforms, (b) methodology: we propose FLOCK, a principled and unsupervised method which efficiently and effectively identifies botted broadcasts and their constituent botted views, and (c) practicality: our approach achieves over 98% precision in identifying botted broadcasts and over 90% precision/recall against sizable synthetically generated viewbot attacks on a real-world livestreaming workload of over 16 million views and 92 thousand broadcasts. FLOCK successfully operates on larger datasets in practice and is regularly used at a large, undisclosed livestreaming corporation."
Can You Spot the Fakes?: On the Limitations of User Feedback in Online Social Networks,"Online social networks (OSNs) are appealing platforms for spammers and fraudsters, who typically use fake or compromised accounts to connect with and defraud real users. To combat such abuse, OSNs allow users to report fraudulent profiles or activity. The OSN can then use reporting data to review and/or limit activity of reported accounts."

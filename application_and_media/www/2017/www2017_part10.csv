Fairness in Package-to-Group Recommendations,"Recommending packages of items to groups of users has several applications, including recommending vacation packages to groups of tourists, entertainment packages to groups of friends, or sets of courses to groups of students. In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of package-to-group recommendations, that of fairness. Specifically, when we recommend a package to a group of people, we ask that this recommendation is fair in the sense that every group member is satisfied by a sufficient number of items in the package. We explore two definitions of fairness and show that for either definition the problem of finding the most fair package is NP-hard. We exploit the fact that our problem can be modeled as a coverage problem, and we propose greedy algorithms that find approximate solutions within reasonable time. In addition, we study two extensions of the problem, where we impose category or spatial constraints on the items to be included in the recommended packages. We evaluate the appropriateness of the fairness models and the performance of the proposed algorithms using real data from Yelp, and a user study."
Streaming Recommender Systems,"The increasing popularity of real-world recommender systems produces data continuously and rapidly, and it becomes more realistic to study recommender systems under streaming scenarios. Data streams present distinct properties such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of recommendation with stream inputs. In particular, we provide a principled framework termed sRec, which provides explicit continuous-time random process models of the creation of users and topics, and of the evolution of their interests. A variational Bayesian approach called recursive meanfield approximation is proposed, which permits computationally efficient instantaneous on-line inference. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our sRec over other state-of-the-arts."
What Your Images Reveal: Exploiting Visual Contents for Point-of-Interest Recommendation,"The rapid growth of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) provides a vast amount of check-in data, which facilitates the study of point-of-interest (POI) recommendation. The majority of the existing POI recommendation methods focus on four aspects, i.e., temporal patterns, geographical influence, social correlations and textual content indications. For example, user's visits to locations have temporal patterns and users are likely to visit POIs near them. In real-world LBSNs such as Instagram, users can upload photos associating with locations. Photos not only reflect users' interests but also provide informative descriptions about locations. For example, a user who posts many architecture photos is more likely to visit famous landmarks; while a user posts lots of images about food has more incentive to visit restaurants. Thus, images have potentials to improve the performance of POI recommendation. However, little work exists for POI recommendation by exploiting images. In this paper, we study the problem of enhancing POI recommendation with visual contents. In particular, we propose a new framework Visual Content Enhanced POI recommendation (VPOI), which incorporates visual contents for POI recommendations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
A General Model for Out-of-town Region Recommendation,"With the rapid growth of location-based social networks (LBSNs), it is now available to analyze and understand user mobility behavior in real world. Studies show that users usually visit nearby points of interest (POIs), located in small regions, especially when they travel out of their hometowns. However, previous out-of-town recommendation systems mainly focus on recommending individual POIs that may reside far from each other, which makes the recommendation results less useful. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem called Region Recommendation, which aims to recommend an out-of-town region of POIs that are likely to be visited by a user. The proximity characteristic of user mobility behavior implies that the probability of visiting one POI depends on those of nearby POIs. Thus, to make accurate region recommendation, our proposed model exploits the influence between POIs, instead of treating them individually. Moreover, to overcome the efficiency problem of searching the best region, we propose a sweeping line-based method, and subsequently an constant-bounded algorithm for better efficiency. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the improved effectiveness of our models over baseline methods and efficiency of the approximate algorithm."

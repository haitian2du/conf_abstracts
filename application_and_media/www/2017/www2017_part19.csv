GPOP: Scalable Group-level Popularity Prediction for Online Content in Social Networks,"Predicting the popularity of online content in social networks is important in many applications, ranging from ad campaign design, web content caching and prefetching, to web-search result ranking. Earlier studies target this problem by learning models that either generalize behaviors of the entire network population or capture behaviors of each individual user. In this paper, we claim that a novel approach based on group-level popularity is necessary and more practical, given that users naturally organize themselves into clusters and that users within a cluster react to online content in a uniform manner. We develop a novel framework by first grouping users into cohesive clusters, and then adopt tensor decomposition to make predictions. In order to minimize the impact of noisy data and be more flexible in capturing changes in users' interests, our framework exploits both the network topology and interaction among users in learning a robust user clustering. The PARAFAC tensor decomposition is adapted to work with hierarchical constraint over user groups, and we show that optimizing this constrained function via gradient descent achieves faster convergence and leads to more stable solutions. Extensive experimental results over two social networks demonstrate that our framework is scalable, finds meaningful user groups, and significantly outperforms eight baseline methods in terms of prediction accuracy."
Expecting to be HIP: Hawkes Intensity Processes for Social Media Popularity,"Modeling and predicting the popularity of online content is a significant problem for the practice of information dissemination, advertising, and consumption. Recent work analyzing massive datasets advances our understanding of popularity, but one major gap remains: To precisely quantify the relationship between the popularity of an online item and the external promotions it receives. This work supplies the missing link between exogenous inputs from public social media platforms, such as Twitter, and endogenous responses within the content platform, such as YouTube. We develop a novel mathematical model, the Hawkes intensity process, which can explain the complex popularity history of each video according to its type of content, network of diffusion, and sensitivity to promotion. Our model supplies a prototypical description of videos, called an endo-exo map. This map explains popularity as the result of an extrinsic factor -- the amount of promotions from the outside world that the video receives, acting upon two intrinsic factors -- sensitivity to promotion, and inherent virality. We use this model to forecast future popularity given promotions on a large 5-months feed of the most-tweeted videos, and found it to lower the average error by 28.6% from approaches based on popularity history. Finally, we can identify videos that have a high potential to become viral, as well as those for which promotions will have hardly any effect."
Taming the Unpredictability of Cultural Markets with Social Influence,"Unpredictability is often portrayed as an undesirable outcome of social influence in cultural markets. Unpredictability stems from the ""rich get richer"" effect, whereby small fluctuations in the market share or popularity of products are amplified over time by social influence. In this paper, we report results of an experimental study that shows that unpredictability is not an inherent property of social influence. We investigate strategies for creating markets in which the popularity of products is better-and more predictably-aligned with their underlying quality. For our study, we created a cultural market of science stories and conducted randomized experiments on different policies for presenting the stories to study participants. Specifically, we varied how the stories were ranked, and whether or not participants were shown the ratings these stories received from others. We present a policy that leverages social influence and product positioning to help distinguish the product's market share (popularity) from underlying quality. Highlighting products with the highest estimated quality reduces the ""rich get richer"" effect highlighting popular products. We show that this policy allows us to more robustly and predictably identify high quality products and promote blockbusters. The policy can be used to create more efficient online cultural markets with a better allocation of resources to products."
Predicting the Success of Online Petitions Leveraging Multidimensional Time-Series,"Applying classical time-series analysis techniques to online content is challenging, as web data tends to have data quality issues and is often incomplete, noisy, or poorly aligned. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting the evolution of a time series of user activity on the web in a manner that is both accurate and interpretable, using related time series to produce a more accurate prediction. We test our methods in the context of predicting signatures for online petitions using data from thousands of petitions posted on The Petition Site - one of the largest platforms of its kind. We observe that the success of these petitions is driven by a number of factors, including promotion through social media channels and on the front page of the petitions platform. We propose an interpretable model that incorporates seasonality, aging effects, self-excitation, and external effects. The interpretability of the model is important for understanding the elements that drives the activity of an online content. We show through an extensive empirical evaluation that our model is significantly better at predicting the outcome of a petition than state-of-the-art techniques."

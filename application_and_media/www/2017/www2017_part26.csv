Correlation Clustering with Low-Rank Matrices,"Correlation clustering is a technique for aggregating data based on qualitative information about which pairs of objects are labeled `similar' or `dissimilar.' Because the optimization problem is NP-hard, much of the previous literature focuses on finding approximation algorithms. In this paper we explore how to solve the correlation clustering objective exactly when the data to be clustered can be represented by a low-rank matrix. We prove in particular that correlation clustering can be solved in polynomial time when the underlying matrix is positive semidefinite with small constant rank, but that the task remains NP-hard in the presence of even one negative eigenvalue. Based on our theoretical results, we develop an algorithm for efficiently ``solving'' low-rank positive semidefinite correlation clustering by employing a procedure for zonotope vertex enumeration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of our algorithm by using it to solve several clustering problems on both synthetic and real-world data."
Consistent Weighted Sampling Made More Practical,"Min-Hash, which is widely used for efficiently estimating similarities of bag-of-words represented data, plays an increasingly important role in the era of big data. It has been extended to deal with real-value weighted sets -- Improved Consistent Weighted Sampling (ICWS) is considered as the state-of-the-art for this problem. In this paper, we propose a Practical CWS (PCWS) algorithm. We first transform the original form of ICWS into an equivalent expression, based on which we find some interesting properties that inspire us to make the ICWS algorithm simpler and more efficient in both space and time complexities. PCWS is not only mathematically equivalent to ICWS and preserves the same theoretical properties, but also saves 20% memory footprint and substantial computational cost compared to ICWS. The experimental results on a number of real-world text data sets demonstrate that PCWS obtains the same (even better) classification and retrieval performance as ICWS with 1/5~1/3 reduced empirical runtime."
Leveraging Large Amounts of Weakly Supervised Data for Multi-Language Sentiment Classification,"This paper presents a novel approach for multi-lingual sentiment classification in short texts. This is a challenging task as the amount of training data in languages other than English is very limited. Previously proposed multi-lingual approaches typically require to establish a correspondence to English for which powerful classifiers are already available. In contrast, our method does not require such supervision. We leverage large amounts of weakly-supervised data in various languages to train a multi-layer convolutional network and demonstrate the importance of using pre-training of such networks. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on various multi-lingual datasets, including the recent SemEval-2016 sentiment prediction benchmark (Task 4), where we achieved state-of-the-art performance. We also compare the performance of our model trained individually for each language to a variant trained for all languages at once. We show that the latter model reaches slightly worse - but still acceptable - performance when compared to the single language model, while benefiting from better generalization properties across languages."
Theory of the GMM Kernel,"In web search, data mining, and machine learning, two popular measures of data similarity are the cosine and the resemblance (the latter is for binary data). In this study, we develop theoretical results for both the cosine and the GMM (generalized min-max) kernel, which is a generalization of the resemblance. GMM has direct applications in machine learning as a positive definite kernel and can be efficiently linearized via probabilistic hashing to handle big data. Owing to its discrete nature, the hashed values can also be used to build hash tables for efficient near neighbor search."

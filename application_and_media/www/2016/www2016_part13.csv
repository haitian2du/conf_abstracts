Query-Less: Predicting Task Repetition for NextGen Proactive Search and Recommendation Engines,"Web search has been a reactive scenario for decades which often starts by users issuing queries. By studying the user behavior in search engine logs, we have discovered that many of the search tasks such as stock-price checking, news reading exhibit strong repeated patterns from day to day. In addition, users exhibit even stronger repetition on mobile devices. This provides us chances to perform proactive recommendations without user issuing queries. In this work, we aim at discovering and characterizing these types of tasks so that we can automatically predict when and what types of tasks will be repeated by the users in the future, through analyzing search logs from a commercial Web search engine and user interaction logs from a mobile App that offers proactive recommendations. We first introduce a set of novel features that can accurately capture task repetition. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that learns user preferences and makes automatic predictions. Our framework is capable of learning both user-independent global models as well as catering personalized models via model adaptation. The model we developed significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art predictive models by large margins. We also demonstrate the power of our model and features through an application to improve the recommendation quality of the mobile App. Results indicate a significant relevance improvement over the current production system."
Behavior Driven Topic Transition for Search Task Identification,"Search tasks in users' query sequences are dynamic and interconnected. The formulation of search tasks can be influenced by multiple latent factors such as user characteristics, product features and search interactions, which makes search task identification a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to identify search tasks via topic membership along with topic transition probabilities, thus it becomes possible to interpret how user's search intent emerges and evolves over time. Moreover, a novel hidden semi-Markov model is introduced to model topic transitions by considering not only the semantic information of queries but also the latent search factors originated from user search behaviors. A variational inference algorithm is developed to identify remarkable search behavior patterns, typical topic transition tracks, and the topic membership of each query from query logs. The learned topic transition tracks and the inferred topic memberships enable us to identify both small search tasks, where a user searches the same topic, and big search tasks, where a user searches a series of related topics. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach and compare with several state-of-the-art search task identification methods on both synthetic and real-world query log data, and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model."
A Piggyback System for Joint Entity Mention Detection and Linking in Web Queries,"In this paper we study the problem of linking open-domain web-search queries towards entities drawn from the full entity inventory of Wikipedia articles. We introduce SMAPH-2, a second-order approach that, by piggybacking on a web search engine, alleviates the noise and irregularities that characterize the language of queries and puts queries in a larger context in which it is easier to make sense of them. The key algorithmic idea underlying SMAPH-2 is to first discover a candidate set of entities and then link-back those entities to their mentions occurring in the input query. This allows us to confine the possible concepts pertinent to the query to only the ones really mentioned in it. The link-back is implemented via a collective disambiguation step based upon a supervised ranking model that makes one joint prediction for the annotation of the complete query optimizing directly the F1 measure. We evaluate both known features, such as word embeddings and semantic relatedness among entities, and several novel features such as an approximate distance between mentions and entities (which can handle spelling errors). We demonstrate that SMAPH-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the [emailÂ protected] benchmark. We also publish GERDAQ (General Entity Recognition, Disambiguation and Annotation in Queries), a novel, public dataset built specifically for web-query entity linking via a crowdsourcing effort. SMAPH-2 outperforms the benchmarks by comparable margins also on GERDAQ."
Towards Mobile Query Auto-Completion: An Efficient Mobile Application-Aware Approach,"We study the new mobile query auto-completion (QAC) problem to exploit mobile devices' exclusive signals, such as those related to mobile applications (apps). We propose AppAware, a novel QAC model using installed app and recently opened app signals to suggest queries for matching input prefixes on mobile devices. To overcome the challenge of noisy and voluminous signals, AppAware optimizes composite objectives with a lighter processing cost at a linear rate of convergence. We conduct experiments on a large commercial data set of mobile queries and apps. Installed app and recently opened app signals consistently and significantly boost the accuracy of various baseline QAC models on mobile devices."

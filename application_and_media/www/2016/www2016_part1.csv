Social Networks Under Stress,"Social network research has begun to take advantage of fine-grained communications regarding coordination, decision-making, and knowledge sharing. These studies, however, have not generally analyzed how external events are associated with a social network's structure and communicative properties. Here, we study how external events are associated with a network's change in structure and communications. Analyzing a complete dataset of millions of instant messages among the decision-makers in a large hedge fund and their network of outside contacts, we investigate the link between price shocks, network structure, and change in the affect and cognition of decision-makers embedded in the network. When price shocks occur the communication network tends not to display structural changes associated with adaptiveness. Rather, the network 'turtles up'. It displays a propensity for higher clustering, strong tie inter- action, and an intensification of insider vs. outsider communication. Further, we find changes in network structure pre- dict shifts in cognitive and affective processes, execution of new transactions, and local optimality of transactions better than prices, revealing the important predictive relationship between network structure and collective behavior within a social network."
Measuring Urban Social Diversity Using Interconnected Geo-Social Networks,"Large metropolitan cities bring together diverse individuals, creating opportunities for cultural and intellectual exchanges, which can ultimately lead to social and economic enrichment. In this work, we present a novel network perspective on the interconnected nature of people and places, allowing us to capture the social diversity of urban locations through the social network and mobility patterns of their visitors. We use a dataset of approximately 37K users and 42K venues in London to build a network of Foursquare places and the parallel Twitter social network of visitors through check-ins. We define four metrics of the social diversity of places which relate to their social brokerage role, their entropy, the homogeneity of their visitors and the amount of serendipitous encounters they are able to induce. This allows us to distinguish between places that bring together strangers versus those which tend to bring together friends, as well as places that attract diverse individuals as opposed to those which attract regulars. We correlate these properties with wellbeing indicators for London neighbourhoods and discover signals of gentrification in deprived areas with high entropy and brokerage, where an influx of more affluent and diverse visitors points to an overall improvement of their rank according to the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation for the area over the five-year census period. Our analysis sheds light on the relationship between the prosperity of people and places, distinguishing between different categories and urban geographies of consequence to the development of urban policy and the next generation of socially-aware location-based applications."
Recommendations in Signed Social Networks,"Recommender systems play a crucial role in mitigating the information overload problem in social media by suggesting relevant information to users. The popularity of pervasively available social activities for social media users has encouraged a large body of literature on exploiting social networks for recommendation. The vast majority of these systems focus on unsigned social networks (or social networks with only positive links), while little work exists for signed social networks (or social networks with positive and negative links). The availability of negative links in signed social networks presents both challenges and opportunities in the recommendation process. We provide a principled and mathematical approach to exploit signed social networks for recommendation, and propose a model, RecSSN, to leverage positive and negative links in signed social networks. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We also perform further experiments to explicitly understand the effect of signed networks in RecSSN."
HeteroSales: Utilizing Heterogeneous Social Networks to Identify the Next Enterprise Customer,"Nowadays, a modern e-commerce company may have both online sales and offline sales departments. Normally, online sales attempt to sell in small quantities to individual customers through broadcasting a large amount of emails or promotion codes, which heavily rely on the designed backend algorithms. Offline sales, on the other hand, try to sell in much larger quantities to enterprise customers through contacts initiated by sales representatives, which are more costly compared to online sales. Unlike many previous research works focusing on machine learning algorithms to support online sales, this paper introduces an approach that utilizes heterogenous social networks to improve the effectiveness of offline sales. More specifically, we propose a two-phase framework, HeteroSales, which first constructs a company-to-company graph, a.k.a. Company Homophily Graph (CHG), from semantics based meta-path learning, and then adopts label propagation on the graph to predict promising companies that we may successfully close an offline deal with. Based on the statistical analysis on the world's largest professional social network, LinkedIn, we demonstrate interesting discoveries showing that not all the social connections in a heterogeneous social network are useful in this task. In other words, some proper data preprocessing is essential to ensure the effectiveness of offline sales. Finally, through the experiments on LinkedIn social network data and third-party offline sales records, we demonstrate the power of HereroSales to identify potential enterprise customers in offline sales."

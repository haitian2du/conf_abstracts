The Death and Life of Great Italian Cities: A Mobile Phone Data Perspective,"The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not been empirically tested until recently. This is mainly because it is hard to collect data about ""city life"". The city of Seoul recently collected pedestrian activity through surveys at an unprecedented scale, with an effort spanning more than a decade, allowing researchers to conduct the first study successfully testing Jacobs's conditions."
Beyond the Baseline: Establishing the Value in Mobile Phone Based Poverty Estimates,"Within the remit of `Data for Development' there have been a number of promising recent works that investigate the use of mobile phone Call Detail Records (CDRs) to estimate the spatial distribution of poverty or socio-economic status. The methods being developed have the potential to offer immense value to organisations and agencies who currently struggle to identify the poorest parts of a country, due to the lack of reliable and up to date survey data in certain parts of the world. However, the results of this research have thus far only been presented in isolation rather than in comparison to any alternative approach or benchmark. Consequently, the true practical value of these methods remains unknown. Here, we seek to allay this shortcoming, by proposing two baseline poverty estimators grounded on concrete usage scenarios: one that exploits correlation with population density only, to be used when no poverty data exists at all; and one that also exploits spatial autocorrelation, to be used when poverty data has been collected for a few regions within a country. We then compare the predictive performance of these baseline models with models that also include features derived from CDRs, so to establish their real added value. We present extensive analysis of the performance of all these models on data acquired for two developing countries -- Senegal and Ivory Coast. Our results reveal that CDR-based models do provide more accurate estimates in most cases; however, the improvement is modest and more significant when estimating (extreme) poverty intensity rates rather than mean wealth."
Pushing the Frontier: Exploring the African Web Ecosystem,"It is well known that Africa's mobile and fixed Internet infrastructure is progressing at a rapid pace. A flurry of recent research has quantified this, highlighting the expansion of its underlying connectivity network. However, improving the infrastructure is not useful without appropriately provisioned services to utilise it. This paper measures the availability of web content infrastructure in Africa. Whereas others have explored web infrastructure in developed regions, we shed light on practices in developing regions. To achieve this, we apply a comprehensive measurement methodology to collect data from a variety of sources. We focus on a large content delivery network to reveal that Africa's content infrastructure is, indeed, expanding. However, we find much web content is still served from the US and Europe. We discover that many of the problems faced are actually caused by significant inter-AS delays in Africa, which contribute to local ISPs not sharing their cache capacity. We discover that a related problem is the poor DNS configuration used by some ISPs, which confounds the attempts of providers to optimise their delivery. We then explore a number of other websites to show that large web infrastructure deployments are a rarity in Africa and that even regional websites host their services abroad. We conclude by making suggestions for improvements."

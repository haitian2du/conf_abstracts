Modeling User Exposure in Recommendation,"Collaborative filtering analyzes user preferences for items (e.g., books, movies, restaurants, academic papers) by exploiting the similarity patterns across users. In implicit feedback settings, all the items, including the ones that a user did not consume, are taken into consideration. But this assumption does not accord with the common sense understanding that users have a limited scope and awareness of items. For example, a user might not have heard of a certain paper, or might live too far away from a restaurant to experience it. In the language of causal analysis (Imbens & Rubin, 2015), the assignment mechanism (i.e., the items that a user is exposed to) is a latent variable that may change for various user/item combinations. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach that directly incorporates user exposure to items into collaborative filtering. The exposure is modeled as a latent variable and the model infers its value from data. In doing so, we recover one of the most successful state-of-the-art approaches as a special case of our model (Hu et al. 2008), and provide a plug-in method for conditioning exposure on various forms of exposure covariates (e.g., topics in text, venue locations). We show that our scalable inference algorithm outperforms existing benchmarks in four different domains both with and without exposure covariates."
On the Relevance of Irrelevant Alternatives,"Multinomial logistic regression is a powerful tool to model choice from a finite set of alternatives, but it comes with an underlying model assumption called the independence of irrelevant alternatives, stating that any item added to the set of choices will decrease all other items' likelihood by an equal fraction. We perform statistical tests of this assumption across a variety of datasets and give results showing how often it is violated."
Growing Wikipedia Across Languages via Recommendation,"The different Wikipedia language editions vary dramatically in how comprehensive they are. As a result, most language editions contain only a small fraction of the sum of information that exists across all Wikipedias. In this paper, we present an approach to filling gaps in article coverage across different Wikipedia editions. Our main contribution is an end-to-end system for recommending articles for creation that exist in one language but are missing in an- other. The system involves identifying missing articles, ranking the missing articles according to their importance, and recommending important missing articles to editors based on their interests. We empirically validate our models in a controlled experiment involving 12,000 French Wikipedia editors. We find that personalizing recommendations increases editor engagement by a factor of two. Moreover, recommending articles increases their chance of being created by a factor of 3.2. Finally, articles created as a result of our recommendations are of comparable quality to organically created articles. Overall, our system leads to more engaged editors and faster growth of Wikipedia with no effect on its quality."
Using Shortlists to Support Decision Making and Improve Recommender System Performance,"In this paper, we study shortlists as an interface component for recommender systems with the dual goal of supporting the user's decision process, as well as improving implicit feedback elicitation for increased recommendation quality. A shortlist is a temporary list of candidates that the user is currently considering, e.g., a list of a few movies the user is currently considering for viewing. From a cognitive perspective, shortlists serve as digital short-term memory where users can off-load the items under consideration -- thereby decreasing their cognitive load. From a machine learning perspective, adding items to the shortlist generates a new implicit feedback signal as a by-product of exploration and decision making which can improve recommendation quality. Shortlisting therefore provides additional data for training recommendation systems without the increases in cognitive load that requesting explicit feedback would incur."

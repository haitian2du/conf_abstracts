An In-depth Study of Mobile Browser Performance,"Mobile page load times are an order of magnitude slower compared to non-mobile pages. It is not clear what causes the poor performance: the slower network, the slower computational speeds, or other reasons. Further, most Web optimizations are designed for non-mobile browsers and do not translate well to the mobile browser. Towards understanding mobile Web page load times, in this paper we: (1) perform an in-depth pairwise comparison of loading a page on a mobile versus a non-mobile browser, and (2) characterize the bottlenecks in the mobile browser {\em vis-a-vis} non-mobile browsers. To this end, we build a testbed that allows us to directly compare the low-level page load activities and bottlenecks when loading a page on a mobile versus a non-mobile browser. We find that computation is the main bottleneck when loading a page on mobile browsers. This is in contrast to non-mobile browsers where networking is the main bottleneck. We also find that the composition of the critical path during page load is different when loading pages on the mobile versus the non-mobile browser. A key takeaway of our work is that we need to fundamentally rethink optimizations for mobile browsers."
The Case for Robotic Wireless Networks,"This paper explores the possibility of injecting mobility into wireless network infrastructure. We envision WiFi access points on wheels that move to optimize user performance. Movements need not be all around the floor, neither do they have to operate on batteries. As a first step, WiFi APs at home could remain tethered to power and Ethernet outlets while moving in small areas (perhaps under the couch). If such systems prove successful, perhaps future buildings and cities could offer explicit support for network infrastructure mobility. This paper begins with a higher level discussion of robotic wireless networks -- the opportunities and the hurdles -- and then pivots by developing a smaller slice of the vision through a system called iMob. With iMob, a WiFi AP is mounted on a Roomba robot and made to periodically move within a 2x2 sqft region. The core research questions pertain to finding the best location to move to, such that the SNRs from its clients are strong, and the interferences from other APs are weak. Our measurements show that the richness of wireless multipath offers significant opportunities -- even within a 2x2 sqft region, locations exist that are 1.7x better than the average location in terms of throughput. When multiple APs in a neighborhood coordinate, the gains can be even higher. In sum, although infrastructure mobility has been discussed in the context of Google Balloons, ad hoc networks, and delay tolerant networks, we believe that the possibility of moving our personal devices in homes and offices is relatively unexplored, and could open doors to new kinds of innovation."
GoCAD: GPU-Assisted Online Content-Adaptive Display Power Saving for Mobile Devices in Internet Streaming,"During Internet streaming, a significant portion of the battery power is always consumed by the display panel on mobile devices. To reduce the display power consumption, backlight scaling, a scheme that intelligently dims the backlight has been proposed. To maintain perceived video appearance in backlight scaling, a computationally intensive luminance compensation process is required. However, this step, if performed by the CPU as existing schemes suggest, could easily offset the power savings gained from backlight scaling. Furthermore, computing the optimal backlight scaling values requires per-frame luminance information, which is typically too energy intensive for mobile devices to compute. Thus, existing schemes require such information to be available in advance. And such an offline approach makes these schemes impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we design and implement GoCAD, a GPU-assisted Online Content-Adaptive Display power saving scheme for mobile devices in Internet streaming sessions. In GoCAD, we employ the mobile device's GPU rather than the CPU to reduce power consumption during the luminance compensation phase. Furthermore, we compute the optimal backlight scaling values for small batches of video frames in an online fashion using a dynamic programming algorithm. Lastly, we make novel use of the widely available video storyboard, a pre-computed set of thumbnails associated with a video, to intelligently decide whether or not to apply our backlight scaling scheme for a given video. For example, when the GPU power consumption would offset the savings from dimming the backlight, no backlight scaling is conducted. To evaluate the performance of GoCAD, we implement a prototype within an Android application and use a Monsoon power monitor to measure the real power consumption. Experiments are conducted on more than 460 randomly selected YouTube videos. Results show that GoCAD can effectively produce power savings without affecting rendered video quality."

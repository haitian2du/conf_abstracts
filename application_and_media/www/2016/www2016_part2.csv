Immersive Recommendation: News and Event Recommendations Using Personal Digital Traces,"We propose a new user-centric recommendation model, called Immersive Recommendation, that incorporates cross-platform and diverse personal digital traces into recommendations. Our context-aware topic modeling algorithm systematically profiles users' interests based on their traces from different contexts, and our hybrid recommendation algorithm makes high-quality recommendations by fusing users' personal profiles, item profiles, and existing ratings. Specifically, in this work we target personalized news and local event recommendations for their utility and societal importance. We evaluated the model with a large-scale offline evaluation leveraging users' public Twitter traces. In addition, we conducted a direct evaluation of the model's recommendations in a 33-participant study using Twitter, Facebook and email traces. In the both cases, the proposed model showed significant improvement over the state-of-the-art algorithms, suggesting the value of using this new user-centric recommendation model to improve recommendation quality, including in cold-start situations."
Beyond Collaborative Filtering: The List Recommendation Problem,"Most Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are optimized using a dataset of isolated user-item tuples. However, in commercial applications recommended items are usually served as an ordered list of several items and not as isolated items. In this setting, inter-item interactions have an effect on the list's Click-Through Rate (CTR) that is unaccounted for using traditional CF approaches. Most CF approaches also ignore additional important factors like click propensity variation, item fatigue, etc. In this work, we introduce the list recommendation problem. We present useful insights gleaned from user behavior and consumption patterns from a large scale real world recommender system. We then propose a novel two-layered framework that builds upon existing CF algorithms to optimize a list's click probability. Our approach accounts for inter-item interactions as well as additional information such as item fatigue, trendiness patterns, contextual information etc. Finally, we evaluate our approach using a novel adaptation of Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) which facilitates off-policy estimation of our method's CTR and showcases its effectiveness in real-world settings."
Economic Recommendation with Surplus Maximization,"A prime function of many major World Wide Web applications is Online Service Allocation (OSA), the function of matching individual consumers with particular services/goods (which may include loans or jobs as well as products) each with its own producer. In the applications of interest, consumers are free to choose, so OSA usually takes the form of personalized recommendation or search in practice. The performance metrics of recommender and search systems currently tend to focus on just one side of the match, in some cases the consumers (e.g. satisfaction) and in other cases the producers (e.g., profit). However, a sustainable OSA platform needs benefit both consumers and producers; otherwise the neglected party eventually may stop using it. In this paper, we show how to adapt economists' traditional idea of maximizing total surplus (the sum of consumer net benefit and producer profit) to the heterogeneous world of online service allocation, in an effort to promote the web intelligence for social good in online eco-systems. Modifications of traditional personalized recommendation algorithms enable us to apply Total Surplus Maximization (TSM) to three very different types of real-world tasks -- e-commerce, P2P lending and freelancing. The results for all three tasks suggest that TSM compares very favorably to currently popular approaches, to the benefit of both producers and consumers."
When do Recommender Systems Work the Best?: The Moderating Effects of Product Attributes and Consumer Reviews on Recommender Performance,"We investigate the moderating effect of product attributes and consumer reviews on the efficacy of a collaborative filtering recommender system on an e-commerce site. We run a randomized field experiment on a top North American retailer's website with 184,375 users split into a recommender-treated group and a control group with 37,215 unique products in the dataset. By augmenting the dataset with Amazon Mechanical Turk tagged product attributes and consumer review data from the website, we study their moderating influence on recommenders in generating conversion. We first confirm that the use of recommenders increases the baseline conversion rate by 5.9%. We find that the recommenders act as substitutes for high average review ratings with the effect of using recommenders increasing the conversion rate as much as about 1.4 additional average star ratings. Additionally, we find that the positive impacts on conversion from recommenders are greater for hedonic products compared to utilitarian products while search-experience quality did not have any impact. We also find that the higher the price, the lower the positive impact of recommenders, while having lengthier product descriptions and higher review volumes increased the recommender's effectiveness. More findings are discussed in the Results."

Characterizing Long-tail SEO Spam on Cloud Web Hosting Services,"The popularity of long-tail search engine optimization (SEO) brings with new security challenges: incidents of long-tail keyword poisoning to lower competition and increase revenue have been reported. The emergence of cloud web hosting services provides a new and effective platform for long-tail SEO spam attacks. There is growing evidence that large-scale long-tail SEO campaigns are being carried out on cloud hosting platforms because they offer low-cost, high-speed hosting services. In this paper, we take the first step toward understanding how long-tail SEO spam is implemented on cloud hosting platforms. After identifying 3,186 cloud directories and 318,470 doorway pages on the leading cloud platforms for long-tail SEO spam, we characterize their abusive behavior. One highlight of our findings is the effectiveness of the cloud-based long-tail SEO spam, with 6% of the doorway pages successfully appearing in the top 10 search results of the poisoned long-tail keywords."
Automatic Extraction of Indicators of Compromise for Web Applications,"Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are forensic artifacts that are used as signs that a system has been compromised by an attack or that it has been infected with a particular malicious software. In this paper we propose for the first time an automated technique to extract and validate IOCs for web applications, by analyzing the information collected by a high-interaction honeypot."
Cracking Classifiers for Evasion: A Case Study on the Google's Phishing Pages Filter,"Various classifiers based on the machine learning techniques have been widely used in security applications. Meanwhile, they also became an attack target of adversaries. Many existing studies have paid much attention to the evasion attacks on the online classifiers and discussed defensive methods. However, the security of the classifiers deployed in the client environment has not got the attention it deserves. Besides, earlier studies only concentrated on the experimental classifiers developed for research purposes only. The security of widely-used commercial classifiers still remains unclear. In this paper, we use the Google's phishing pages filter (GPPF), a classifier deployed in the Chrome browser which owns over one billion users, as a case to investigate the security challenges for the client-side classifiers. We present a new attack methodology targeting on client-side classifiers, called classifiers cracking. With the methodology, we successfully cracked the classification model of GPPF and extracted sufficient knowledge can be exploited for evasion attacks, including the classification algorithm, scoring rules and features, etc. Most importantly, we completely reverse engineered 84.8% scoring rules, covering most of high-weighted rules. Based on the cracked information, we performed two kinds of evasion attacks to GPPF, using 100 real phishing pages for the evaluation purpose. The experiments show that all the phishing pages (100%) can be easily manipulated to bypass the detection of GPPF. Our study demonstrates that the existing client-side classifiers are very vulnerable to classifiers cracking attacks."
Understanding the Detection of View Fraud in Video Content Portals,"While substantial effort has been devoted to understand fraudulent activity in traditional online advertising (search and banner), more recent forms such as video ads have received little attention. The understanding and identification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for advertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection mechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development of independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems are missing today and needed by both industry and regulators."

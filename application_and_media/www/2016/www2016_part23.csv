Tell Me About Yourself: The Malicious CAPTCHA Attack,"We present the malicious CAPTCHA attack, allowing a rogue website to trick users into unknowingly disclosing their private information. The rogue site displays the private information to the user in obfuscated manner, as if it is a CAPTCHA challenge; the user is unaware that solving the CAPTCHA, results in disclosing private information. This circumvents the Same Origin Policy (SOP), whose goal is to prevent access by rogue sites to private information, by exploiting the fact that many websites allow display of private information (to the user), upon requests from any (even rogue) website. Information so disclosed includes name, phone number, email and physical addresses, search history, preferences, partial credit card numbers, and more. The vulnerability is common and the attack works for many popular sites, including nine out of the ten most popular websites. We evaluated the attack using IRB-approved, ethical user experiments."
Remedying Web Hijacking: Notification Effectiveness and Webmaster Comprehension,"As miscreants routinely hijack thousands of vulnerable web servers weekly for cheap hosting and traffic acquisition, security services have turned to notifications both to alert webmasters of ongoing incidents as well as to expedite recovery. In this work we present the first large-scale measurement study on the effectiveness of combinations of browser, search, and direct webmaster notifications at reducing the duration a site remains compromised. Our study captures the life cycle of 760,935 hijacking incidents from July, 2014--June, 2015, as identified by Google Safe Browsing and Search Quality. We observe that direct communication with webmasters increases the likelihood of cleanup by over 50% and reduces infection lengths by at least 62%. Absent this open channel for communication, we find browser interstitials---while intended to alert visitors to potentially harmful content---correlate with faster remediation. As part of our study, we also explore whether webmasters exhibit the necessary technical expertise to address hijacking incidents. Based on appeal logs where webmasters alert Google that their site is no longer compromised, we find 80% of operators successfully clean up symptoms on their first appeal. However, a sizeable fraction of site owners do not address the root cause of compromise, with over 12% of sites falling victim to a new attack within 30 days. We distill these findings into a set of recommendations for improving web security and best practices for webmasters."
No Honor Among Thieves: A Large-Scale Analysis of Malicious Web Shells,"Web shells are malicious scripts that attackers upload to a compromised web server in order to remotely execute arbitrary commands, maintain their access, and elevate their privileges. Despite their high prevalence in practice and heavy involvement in security breaches, web shells have never been the direct subject of any study. In contrast, web shells have been treated as malicious blackboxes that need to be detected and removed, rather than malicious pieces of software that need to be analyzed and, in detail, understood. In this paper, we report on the first comprehensive study of web shells. By utilizing different static and dynamic analysis methods, we discover and quantify the visible and invisible features offered by popular malicious shells, and we discuss how attackers can take advantage of these features. For visible features, we find the presence of password bruteforcers, SQL database clients, portscanners, and checks for the presence of security software installed on the compromised server. In terms of invisible features, we find that about half of the analyzed shells contain an authentication mechanism, but this mechanism can be bypassed in a third of the cases. Furthermore, we find that about a third of the analyzed shells perform homephoning, i.e., the shells, upon execution, surreptitiously communicate to various third parties with the intent of revealing the location of new shell installations. By setting up honeypots, we quantify the number of third-party attackers benefiting from shell installations and show how an attacker, by merely registering the appropriate domains, can completely take over all installations of specific vulnerable shells."
Stress Testing the Booters: Understanding and Undermining the Business of DDoS Services,"DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booters, have commoditized DDoS attacks and enabled abusive subscribers of these services to cheaply extort, harass and intimidate businesses and people by taking them offline. However, due to the underground nature of these booters, little is known about their underlying technical and business structure. In this paper, we empirically measure many facets of their technical and payment infrastructure. We also perform an analysis of leaked and scraped data from three major booters---Asylum Stresser, Lizard Stresser and VDO---which provides us with an in-depth view of their customers and victims. Finally, we conduct a large-scale payment intervention in collaboration with PayPal and evaluate its effectiveness as a deterrent to their operations. Based on our analysis, we show that these booters are responsible for hundreds of thousands of DDoS attacks and identify potentially promising methods to undermine these services by increasing their costs of operation."

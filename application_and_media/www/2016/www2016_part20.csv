MapWatch: Detecting and Monitoring International Border Personalization on Online Maps,"Maps have long played a crucial role in enabling people to conceptualize and navigate the world around them. However, maps also encode the world-views of their creators. Disputed international borders are one example of this: governments may mandate that cartographers produce maps that conform to their view of a territorial dispute. Today, online maps maintained by private corporations have become the norm. However, these new maps are still subject to old debates. Companies like Google and Bing resolve these disputes by localizing their maps to meet government requirements and user preferences, i.e., users in different locations are shown maps with different international boundaries. We argue that this non-transparent personalization of maps may exacerbate nationalistic disputes by promoting divergent views of geopolitical realities."
What Links Alice and Bob?: Matching and Ranking Semantic Patterns in Heterogeneous Networks,"An increasing number of applications are modeled and analyzed in network form, where nodes represent entities of interest and edges represent interactions or relationships between entities. Commonly, such relationship analysis tools assume homogeneity in both node type and edge type. Recent research has sought to redress the assumption of homogeneity and focused on mining heterogeneous information networks (HINs) where both nodes and edges can be of different types. Building on such efforts, in this work we articulate a novel approach for mining relationships across entities in such networks while accounting for user preference (prioritization) over relationship type and interestingness metric. We formalize the problem as a top-$k$ lightest paths problem, contextualized in a real-world communication network, and seek to find the $k$ most interesting path instances matching the preferred relationship type. Our solution, PROphetic HEuristic Algorithm for Path Searching (PRO-HEAPS), leverages a combination of novel graph preprocessing techniques, well designed heuristics and the venerable A* search algorithm. We run our algorithm on real-world large-scale graphs and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms a wide variety of baseline approaches with speedups as large as 100X. We also conduct a case study and demonstrate valuable applications of our algorithm."
An Empirical Study of Web Cookies,"Web cookies are used widely by publishers and 3rd parties to track users and their behaviors. Despite the ubiquitous use of cookies, there is little prior work on their characteristics such as standard attributes, placement policies, and the knowledge that can be amassed via 3rd party cookies. In this paper, we present an empirical study of web cookie characteristics, placement practices and information transmission. To conduct this study, we implemented a lightweight web crawler that tracks and stores the cookies as it navigates to websites. We use this crawler to collect over 3.2M cookies from the two crawls, separated by 18 months, of the top 100K Alexa web sites. We report on the general cookie characteristics and add context via a cookie category index and website genre labels. We consider privacy implications by examining specific cookie attributes and placement behavior of 3rd party cookies. We find that 3rd party cookies outnumber 1st party cookies by a factor of two, and we illuminate the connection between domain genres and cookie attributes. We find that less than 1% of the entities that place cookies can aggregate information across 75% of web sites. Finally, we consider the issue of information transmission and aggregation by domains via 3rd party cookies. We develop a mathematical framework to quantify user information leakage for a broad class of users, and present findings using real world domains. In particular, we demonstrate the interplay between a domain's footprint across the Internet and the browsing behavior of users, which has significant impact on information transmission."
From Social Machines to Social Protocols: Software Engineering Foundations for Sociotechnical Systems,"The overarching vision of social machines is to facilitate social processes by having computers provide administrative support. We conceive of a social machine as a sociotechnical system (STS): a software-supported system in which autonomous principals such as humans and organizations interact to exchange information and services. Existing approaches for social machines emphasize the technical aspects and inadequately support the meanings of social processes, leaving them informally realized in human interactions. We posit that a fundamental rethinking is needed to incorporate accountability, essential for addressing the openness of the Web and the autonomy of its principals. We introduce Interaction-Oriented Software Engineering (IOSE) as a paradigm expressly suited to capturing the social basis of STSs. Motivated by promoting openness and autonomy, IOSE focuses not on implementation but on social protocols, specifying how social relationships, characterizing the accountability of the concerned parties, progress as they interact. Motivated by providing computational support, IOSE adopts the accountability representation to capture the meaning of a social machine's states and transitions."

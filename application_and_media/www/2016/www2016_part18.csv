Table Cell Search for Question Answering,"Tables are pervasive on the Web. Informative web tables range across a large variety of topics, which can naturally serve as a significant resource to satisfy user information needs. Driven by such observations, in this paper, we investigate an important yet largely under-addressed problem: Given millions of tables, how to precisely retrieve table cells to answer a user question. This work proposes a novel table cell search framework to attack this problem. We first formulate the concept of a relational chain which connects two cells in a table and represents the semantic relation between them. With the help of search engine snippets, our framework generates a set of relational chains pointing to potentially correct answer cells. We further employ deep neural networks to conduct more fine-grained inference on which relational chains best match the input question and finally extract the corresponding answer cells. Based on millions of tables crawled from the Web, we evaluate our framework in the open-domain question answering (QA) setting, using both the well-known WebQuestions dataset and user queries mined from Bing search engine logs. On WebQuestions, our framework is comparable to state-of-the-art QA systems based on knowledge bases (KBs), while on Bing queries, it outperforms other systems with a 56.7% relative gain. Moreover, when combined with results from our framework, KB-based QA performance can obtain a relative improvement of 28.1% to 66.7%, demonstrating that web tables supply rich knowledge that might not exist or is difficult to be identified in existing KBs."
Identifying Web Queries with Question Intent,"Vertical selection is the task of predicting relevant verticals for a Web query so as to enrich the Web search results with complementary vertical results. We investigate a novel variant of this task, where the goal is to detect queries with a question intent. Specifically, we address queries for which the user would like an answer with a human touch. We call these CQA-intent queries, since answers to them are typically found in community question answering (CQA) sites. A typical approach in vertical selection is using a vertical's specific language model of relevant queries and computing the query-likelihood for each vertical as a selective criterion. This works quite well for many domains like Shopping, Local and Travel. Yet, we claim that queries with CQA intent are harder to distinguish by modeling content alone, since they cover many different topics. We propose to also take the structure of queries into consideration, reasoning that queries with question intent have quite a different structure than other queries. We present a supervised classification scheme, random forest over word-clusters for variable length texts, which can model the query structure. Our experiments show that it substantially improves classification performance in the CQA-intent selection task compared to content-oriented based classification, especially as query length grows."
A Study of Retrieval Models for Long Documents and Queries in Information Retrieval,"Recent research has shown that long documents are unfairly penalised by a number of current retrieval methods. In this paper, we formally analyse two important but distinct reasons for normalising documents with respect to length, namely verbosity and scope, and discuss the practical implications of not normalising accordingly. We review a number of language modelling approaches and a range of recently developed retrieval methods, and show that most do not correctly model both phenomena, thus limiting their retrieval effectiveness in certain situations. Furthermore, the retrieval characteristics of long natural language queries have not traditionally had the same attention as short keyword queries. We develop a new discriminative query language modelling approach that demonstrates improved performance on long verbose queries by appropriately weighting salient aspects of the query. When combined with query expansion, we show that our new approach yields state-of-the-art performance for long verbose queries."
Effective Construction of Relative Lempel-Ziv Dictionaries,"Web crawls generate vast quantities of text, retained and archived by the search services that initiate them. To store such data and to allow storage costs to be minimized, while still providing some level of random access to the compressed data, efficient and effective compression techniques are critical. The Relative Lempel Ziv (RLZ) scheme provides fast decompression and retrieval of documents from within large compressed collections, and even with a relatively small RAM-resident dictionary, is competitive relative to adaptive compression schemes. To date, the dictionaries required by RLZ compression have been formed from concatenations of substrings regularly sampled from the underlying document collection, then pruned in a manner that seeks to retain only the high-use sections. In this work, we develop new dictionary design heuristics, based on effective construction, rather than on pruning; we identify dictionary construction as a (string) covering problem. To avoid the complications of string covering algorithms on large collections, we focus on k-mers and their frequencies. First, with a reservoir sampler, we efficiently identify the most common k-mers. Then, since a collection typically comprises regions of local similarity, we select in each ""epoch"" a segment whose k-mers together achieve, locally, the highest coverage score. The dictionary is formed from the concatenation of these epoch-derived segments. Our selection process is inspired by the greedy approach to the Set Cover problem."

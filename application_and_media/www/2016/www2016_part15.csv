A Robust Framework for Estimating Linguistic Alignment in Twitter Conversations,"When people talk, they tend to adopt the behaviors, gestures, and language of their conversational partners. This ""accommodation"" to one's partners is largely automatic, but the degree to which it occurs is influenced by social factors, such as gender, relative power, and attraction. In settings where such social information is not known, this accommodation can be a useful cue for the missing information. This is especially important in web-based communication, where social dynamics are often fluid and rarely stated explicitly. But connecting accommodation and social dynamics on the web requires accurate quantification of the different amounts of accommodation being made."
Detecting Evolution of Concepts based on Cause-Effect Relationships in Online Reviews,"Analyzing how technology evolves is important for understanding technological progress and its impact on society. Although the concept of evolution has been explored in many domains (e.g., evolution of topics, events or terminology, evolution of species), little research has been done on automatically analyzing the evolution of products and technology in general. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for investigating the technology evolution based on collections of product reviews. We are particularly interested in understanding social impact of technology and in discovering how changes of product features influence changes in our social lives. We address this challenge by first distinguishing two kinds of product-related terms: physical product features and terms describing situations when products are used. We then detect changes in both types of terms over time by tracking fluctuations in their popularity and usage. Finally, we discover cases when changes of physical product features trigger the changes in product's use. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Amazon Product Review Dataset that spans over 18 years."
The QWERTY Effect on the Web: How Typing Shapes the Meaning of Words in Online Human-Computer Interaction,"The QWERTY effect postulates that the keyboard layout influences word meanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to the use of the left hand. For example, previous research has established that words with more right hand letters are rated more positively than words with more left hand letters by human subjects in small scale experiments. In this paper, we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web. Using data from eleven web platforms related to products, movies, books, and videos, we conduct observational tests whether a hand-meaning relationship can be found in text interpretations by web users. Furthermore, we investigate whether writing text on the web exhibits the QWERTY effect as well, by analyzing the relationship between the text of online reviews and their star ratings in four additional datasets. Overall, we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect both at the point of text interpretation (decoding) and at the point of text creation (encoding). We also find under which conditions the effect might not hold. Our findings have implications for any algorithmic method aiming to evaluate the meaning of words on the web, including for example semantic or sentiment analysis, and show the existence of ""dactilar onomatopoeias"" that shape the dynamics of word-meaning associations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal the extent to which the QWERTY effect exists in large scale human-computer interaction on the web."

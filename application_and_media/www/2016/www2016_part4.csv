Abusive Language Detection in Online User Content,"Detection of abusive language in user generated online content has become an issue of increasing importance in recent years. Most current commercial methods make use of blacklists and regular expressions, however these measures fall short when contending with more subtle, less ham-fisted examples of hate speech. In this work, we develop a machine learning based method to detect hate speech on online user comments from two domains which outperforms a state-of-the-art deep learning approach. We also develop a corpus of user comments annotated for abusive language, the first of its kind. Finally, we use our detection tool to analyze abusive language over time and in different settings to further enhance our knowledge of this behavior."
Hidden Topic Sentiment Model,"Various topic models have been developed for sentiment analysis tasks. But the simple topic-sentiment mixture assumption prohibits them from finding fine-grained dependency between topical aspects and sentiments. In this paper, we build a Hidden Topic Sentiment Model (HTSM) to explicitly capture topic coherence and sentiment consistency in an opinionated text document to accurately extract latent aspects and corresponding sentiment polarities. In HTSM, 1) topic coherence is achieved by enforcing words in the same sentence to share the same topic assignment and modeling topic transition between successive sentences; 2) sentiment consistency is imposed by constraining topic transitions via tracking sentiment changes; and 3) both topic transition and sentiment transition are guided by a parameterized logistic function based on the linguistic signals directly observable in a document. Extensive experiments on four categories of product reviews from both Amazon and NewEgg validate the effectiveness of the proposed model."
Mining Aspect-Specific Opinion using a Holistic Lifelong Topic Model,"Aspect-level sentiment analysis or opinion mining consists of several core sub-tasks: aspect extraction, opinion identification, polarity classification, and separation of general and aspect-specific opinions. Various topic models have been proposed by researchers to address some of these sub-tasks. However, there is little work on modeling all of them together. In this paper, we first propose a holistic fine-grained topic model, called the JAST (Joint Aspect-based Sentiment Topic) model, that can simultaneously model all of above problems under a unified framework. To further improve it, we incorporate the idea of lifelong machine learning and propose a more advanced model, called the LAST (Lifelong Aspect-based Sentiment Topic) model. LAST automatically mines the prior knowledge of aspect, opinion, and their correspondence from other products or domains. Such knowledge is automatically extracted and incorporated into the proposed LAST model without any human involvement. Our experiments using reviews of a large number of product domains show major improvements of the proposed models over state-of-the-art baselines."

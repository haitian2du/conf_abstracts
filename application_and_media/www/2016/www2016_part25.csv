Bayesian Budget Feasibility with Posted Pricing,"We consider the problem of budget feasible mechanism design proposed by Singer, but in a Bayesian setting. A principal has a public value for hiring a subset of the agents and a budget, while the agents have private costs for being hired. We consider both additive and submodular value functions of the principal. We show that there are simple, practical, ex post budget balanced posted pricing mechanisms that approximate the value obtained by the Bayesian optimal mechanism that is budget balanced only in expectation. A main motivating application for this work is crowdsourcing, e.g., on Mechanical Turk, where workers are drawn from a large population and posted pricing is standard. Our analysis methods relate to contention resolution schemes in submodular optimization of Vondr√†k et al. and the correlation gap analysis of Yan."
People and Cookies: Imperfect Treatment Assignment in Online Experiments,"Identifying the same internet user across devices or over time is often infeasible. This presents a problem for online experiments, as it precludes person-level randomization. Randomization must instead be done using imperfect proxies for people, like cookies, email addresses, or device identifiers. Users may be partially treated and partially untreated as some of their cookies are assigned to the test group and some to the control group, complicating statistical inference. We show that the estimated treatment effect in a cookie-level experiment converges to a weighted average of the marginal effects of treating more of a user's cookies. If the marginal effects of cookie treatment exposure are positive and constant, it underestimates the true person-level effect by a factor equal to the number of cookies per person. Using two separate datasets---cookie assignment data from Atlas and advertising exposure and purchase data from Facebook---we empirically quantify the differences between cookie and person-level advertising effectiveness experiments. The effects are substantial: cookie tests underestimate the true person-level effects by a factor of about three, and require two to three times the number of people to achieve the same power as a test with perfect treatment assignment."
Objective Variables for Probabilistic Revenue Maximization in Second-Price Auctions with Reserve,"Many online companies sell advertisement space in second-price auctions with reserve. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic method to learn a profitable strategy to set the reserve price. We use historical auction data with features to fit a predictor of the best reserve price. This problem is delicate - the structure of the auction is such that a reserve price set too high is much worse than a reserve price set too low. To address this we develop objective variables, an approach for combining probabilistic modeling with optimal decision-making. Objective variables are ""hallucinated observations"" that transform the revenue maximization task into a regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem, which we solve with the EM algorithm. This framework enables a variety of prediction mechanisms to set the reserve price. As examples, we study objective variable methods with regression, kernelized regression, and neural networks on simulated and real data. Our methods outperform previous approaches both in terms of scalability and profit."
Understanding User Economic Behavior in the City Using Large-scale Geotagged and Crowdsourced Data,"The pervasiveness of mobile technologies today have facilitated the creation of massive crowdsourced and geotagged data from individual users in real time and at different locations in the city. Such ubiquitous user-generated data allow us to infer various patterns of human behavior, which help us understand the interactions between humans and cities. In this study, we focus on understanding users economic behavior in the city by examining the economic value from crowdsourced and geotaggged data. Specifically, we extract multiple traffic and human mobility features from publicly available data sources using NLP and geo-mapping techniques, and examine the effects of both static and dynamic features on economic outcome of local businesses. Our study is instantiated on a unique dataset of restaurant bookings from OpenTable for 3,187 restaurants in New York City from November 2013 to March 2014. Our results suggest that foot traffic can increase local popularity and business performance, while mobility and traffic from automobiles may hurt local businesses, especially the well-established chains and high-end restaurants. We also find that on average one more street closure nearby leads to a 4.7% decrease in the probability of a restaurant being fully booked during the dinner peak. Our study demonstrates the potential of how to best make use of the large volumes and diverse sources of crowdsourced and geotagged user-generated data to create matrices to predict local economic demand in a manner that is fast, cheap, accurate, and meaningful."

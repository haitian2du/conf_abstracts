IncApprox: A Data Analytics System for Incremental Approximate Computing,"Incremental and approximate computations are increasingly being adopted for data analytics to achieve low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs of a job with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items."
From Diversity-based Prediction to Better Ontology & Schema Matching,"Ontology & schema matching predictors assess the quality of matchers in the absence of an exact match. We propose MCD (Match Competitor Deviation), a new diversity-based predictor that compares the strength of a matcher confidence in the correspondence of a concept pair with respect to other correspondences that involve either concept. We also propose to use MCD as a regulator to optimally control a balance between Precision and Recall and use it towards 1:1 matching by combining it with a similarity measure that is based on solving a maximum weight bipartite graph matching (MWBM). Optimizing the combined measure is known to be an NP-Hard problem. Therefore, we propose CEM, an approximation to an optimal match by efficiently scanning multiple possible matches, using rare event estimation. Using a thorough empirical study over several benchmark real-world datasets, we show that MCD outperforms other state-of-the-art predictor and that CEM significantly outperform existing matchers."

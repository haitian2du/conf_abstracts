Voting with Their Feet: Inferring User Preferences from App Management Activities,"Smartphone users have adopted an explosive number of mobile applications (a.k.a., apps) in the recent years. App marketplaces for iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms host millions of apps which have been downloaded for more than 100 billion times. Investigating how people manage mobile apps in their everyday lives creates a unique opportunity to understand the behavior and preferences of mobile users, to infer the quality of apps, and to improve the user experience. Existing literature provides very limited knowledge about app management activities, due to the lack of user behavioral data at scale. This paper takes the initiative to analyze a very large app management log collected through a leading Android app marketplace. The data set covers five months of detailed downloading, updating, and uninstallation activities, involving 17 million anonymized users and one million apps. We present a surprising finding that the metrics commonly used by app stores to rank apps do not truly reflect the users' real attitudes towards the apps. We then identify useful patterns from the app management activities that much more accurately predict the user preferences of an app even when no user rating is available."
User Fatigue in Online News Recommendation,"Many aspects and properties of Recommender Systems have been well studied in the past decade, however, the impact of User Fatigue has been mostly ignored in the literature. User fatigue represents the phenomenon that a user quickly loses the interest on the recommended item if the same item has been presented to this user multiple times before. The direct impact caused by the user fatigue is the dramatic decrease of the Click Through Rate (CTR, i.e., the ratio of clicks to impressions). In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the research of the user fatigue in online recommender systems. By analyzing user behavioral logs from Bing Now news recommendation, we find that user fatigue is a severe problem that greatly affects the user experience. We also notice that different users engage differently with repeated recommendations. Depending on the previous users' interaction with repeated recommendations, we illustrate that under certain condition the previously seen items should be demoted, while some other times they should be promoted. We demonstrate how statistics about the analysis of the user fatigue can be incorporated into ranking algorithms for personalized recommendations. Our experimental results indicate that significant gains can be achieved by introducing features that reflect users' interaction with previously seen recommendations (up to 15% enhancement on all users and 34% improvement on heavy users)."
Mining User Intentions from Medical Queries: A Neural Network Based Heterogeneous Jointly Modeling Approach,"Text queries are naturally encoded with user intentions. An intention detection task tries to model and discover intentions that user encoded in text queries. Unlike conventional text classification tasks where the label of text is highly correlated with some topic-specific words, words from different topic categories tend to co-occur in medical related queries. Besides the existence of topic-specific words and word order, word correlations and the way words organized into sentence are crucial to intention detection tasks."

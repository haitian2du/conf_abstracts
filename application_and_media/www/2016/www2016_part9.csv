On the Temporal Dynamics of Opinion Spamming: Case Studies on Yelp,"Recently, the problem of opinion spam has been widespread and has attracted a lot of research attention. While the problem has been approached on a variety of dimensions, the temporal dynamics in which opinion spamming operates is unclear. Are there specific spamming policies that spammers employ? What kind of changes happen with respect to the dynamics to the truthful ratings on entities. How do buffered spamming operate for entities that need spamming to retain threshold popularity and reduced spamming for entities making better success? We analyze these questions in the light of time-series analysis on Yelp. Our analyses discover various temporal patterns and their relationships with the rate at which fake reviews are posted. Building on our analyses, we employ vector autoregression to predict the rate of deception across different spamming policies. Next, we explore the effect of filtered reviews on (long-term and imminent) future rating and popularity prediction of entities. Our results discover novel temporal dynamics of spamming which are intuitive, arguable and also render confidence on Yelp's filtering. Lastly, we leverage our discovered temporal patterns in deception detection. Experimental results on large-scale reviews show the effectiveness of our approach that significantly improves the existing approaches."
Scaling up Dynamic Topic Models,"Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discovering topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational approximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics. This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based $O(1)$ sampler for topic assignments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical results show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity."
Learning Global Term Weights for Content-based Recommender Systems,"Recommender systems typically leverage two types of signals to effectively recommend items to users: user activities and content matching between user and item profiles, and recommendation models in literature are usually categorized into collaborative filtering models, content-based models and hybrid models. In practice, when rich profiles about users and items are available, and user activities are sparse (cold-start), effective content matching signals become much more important in the relevance of the recommendation. The de-facto method to measure similarity between two pieces of text is computing the cosine similarity of the two bags of words, and each word is weighted by TF (term frequency within the document) x IDF (inverted document frequency of the word within the corpus). In general sense, TF can represent any local weighting scheme of the word within each document, and IDF can represent any global weighting scheme of the word across the corpus. In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., optimizing the global term weights, for a particular recommendation domain by leveraging supervised approaches. The intuition is that some frequent words (lower IDF, e.g. ``database'') can be essential and predictive for relevant recommendation, while some rare words (higher IDF, e.g. the name of a small company) could have less predictive power. Given plenty of observed activities between users and items as training data, we should be able to learn better domain-specific global term weights, which can further improve the relevance of recommendation."

Detecting Good Abandonment in Mobile Search,"Web search queries for which there are no clicks are referred to as abandoned queries and are usually considered as leading to user dissatisfaction. However, there are many cases where a user may not click on any search result page (SERP) but still be satisfied. This scenario is referred to as good abandonment and presents a challenge for most approaches measuring search satisfaction, which are usually based on clicks and dwell time. The problem is exacerbated further on mobile devices where search providers try to increase the likelihood of users being satisfied directly by the SERP. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using gesture interactions, such as reading times and touch actions, as signals for differentiating between good and bad abandonment. These signals go beyond clicks and characterize user behavior in cases where clicks are not needed to achieve satisfaction. We study different good abandonment scenarios and investigate the different elements on a SERP that may lead to good abandonment. We also present an analysis of the correlation between user gesture features and satisfaction. Finally, we use this analysis to build models to automatically identify good abandonment in mobile search achieving an accuracy of 75%, which is significantly better than considering query and session signals alone. Our findings have implications for the study and application of user satisfaction in search systems."
Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering,"Building a successful recommender system depends on understanding both the dimensions of people's preferences as well as their dynamics. In certain domains, such as fashion, modeling such preferences can be incredibly difficult, due to the need to simultaneously model the visual appearance of products as well as their evolution over time. The subtle semantics and non-linear dynamics of fashion evolution raise unique challenges especially considering the sparsity and large scale of the underlying datasets. In this paper we build novel models for the One-Class Collaborative Filtering setting, where our goal is to estimate users' fashion-aware personalized ranking functions based on their past feedback. To uncover the complex and evolving visual factors that people consider when evaluating products, our method combines high-level visual features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, users' past feedback, as well as evolving trends within the community. Experimentally we evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets from Amazon.com, where we show it to outperform state-of-the-art personalized ranking measures, and also use it to visualize the high-level fashion trends across the 11-year span of our dataset."
Modeling User Consumption Sequences,"We study sequences of consumption in which the same item may be consumed multiple times. We identify two macroscopic behavior patterns of repeated consumptions. First, in a given user's lifetime, very few items live for a long time. Second, the last consumptions of an item exhibit growing inter-arrival gaps consistent with the notion of increasing boredom leading up to eventual abandonment."

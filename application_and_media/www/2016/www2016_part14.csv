"Disinformation on the Web: Impact, Characteristics, and Detection of Wikipedia Hoaxes","Wikipedia is a major source of information for many people. However, false information on Wikipedia raises concerns about its credibility. One way in which false information may be presented on Wikipedia is in the form of hoax articles, i.e., articles containing fabricated facts about nonexistent entities or events. In this paper we study false information on Wikipedia by focusing on the hoax articles that have been created throughout its history. We make several contributions. First, we assess the real-world impact of hoax articles by measuring how long they survive before being debunked, how many pageviews they receive, and how heavily they are referred to by documents on the Web. We find that, while most hoaxes are detected quickly and have little impact on Wikipedia, a small number of hoaxes survive long and are well cited across the Web. Second, we characterize the nature of successful hoaxes by comparing them to legitimate articles and to failed hoaxes that were discovered shortly after being created. We find characteristic differences in terms of article structure and content, embeddedness into the rest of Wikipedia, and features of the editor who created the hoax. Third, we successfully apply our findings to address a series of classification tasks, most notably to determine whether a given article is a hoax. And finally, we describe and evaluate a task involving humans distinguishing hoaxes from non-hoaxes. We find that humans are not particularly good at the task and that our automated classifier outperforms them by a big margin."
Tweet Properly: Analyzing Deleted Tweets to Understand and Identify Regrettable Ones,"Inappropriate tweets can cause severe damages on authors' reputation or privacy. However, many users do not realize the negative consequences until they publish these tweets. Published tweets have lasting effects that may not be eliminated by simple deletion because other users may have read them or third-party tweet analysis platforms have cached them. Regrettable tweets, i.e., tweets with identifiable regrettable contents, cause the most damage on their authors because other users can easily notice them. In this paper, we study how to identify the regrettable tweets published by \emph{normal individual users} via the contents and users' historical deletion patterns. We identify normal individual users based on their publishing, deleting, followers and friends statistics. We manually examine a set of randomly sampled deleted tweets from these users to identify regrettable tweets and understand the corresponding regrettable reasons. By applying content-based features and personalized history-based features, we develop classifiers that can effectively predict regrettable tweets."
Winning Arguments: Interaction Dynamics and Persuasion Strategies in Good-faith Online Discussions,"Changing someone's opinion is arguably one of the most important challenges of social interaction. The underlying process proves difficult to study: it is hard to know how someone's opinions are formed and whether and how someone's views shift. Fortunately, ChangeMyView, an active community on Reddit, provides a platform where users present their own opinions and reasoning, invite others to contest them, and acknowledge when the ensuing discussions change their original views. In this work, we study these interactions to understand the mechanisms behind persuasion."
Addressing Complex and Subjective Product-Related Queries with Customer Reviews,"Online reviews are often our first port of call when considering products and purchases online. When evaluating a potential purchase, we may have a specific query in mind, e.g. `will this baby seat fit in the overhead compartment of a 747?' or `will I like this album if I liked Taylor Swift's 1989?'. To answer such questions we must either wade through huge volumes of consumer reviews hoping to find one that is relevant, or otherwise pose our question directly to the community via a Q/A system."

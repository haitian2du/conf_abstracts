Which to View: Personalized Prioritization for Broadcast Emails,"Email is one of the most important communication tools today, but email overload resulting from the large number of unimportant or irrelevant emails is causing trillion-level economy loss every year. Thus personalized email prioritization algorithms are of urgent need. Despite lots of previous effort on this topic, broadcast email, an important type of email, is overlooked in previous literature. Broadcast emails are significantly different from normal emails, introducing both new challenges and opportunities. On one hand, lack of real senders and limited user interactions invalidate the key features exploited by traditional email prioritization algorithms; on the other hand, thousands of receivers for one broadcast email bring us the opportunity to predict importance through collaborative filtering. However, broadcast emails face a severe cold-start problem which hinders the direct application of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we propose the first framework for broadcast email prioritization by designing a novel active learning model that considers the collaborative filtering, implicit feedback and time sensitive responsiveness features of broadcast emails. Our method is thoroughly evaluated on a large scale real world industrial dataset from Samsung Electronics. Our method is proved highly effective and outperforms state-of-the-art personalized email prioritization methods."
Learning-to-Rank for Real-Time High-Precision Hashtag Recommendation for Streaming News,"We address the problem of real-time recommendation of streaming Twitter hashtags to an incoming stream of news articles. The technical challenge can be framed as large scale topic classification where the set of topics (i.e., hashtags) is huge and highly dynamic. Our main applications come from digital journalism, e.g., promoting original content to Twitter communities and social indexing of news to enable better retrieval and story tracking. In contrast to the state-of-the-art that focuses on topic modelling approaches, we propose a learning-to-rank approach for modelling hashtag relevance. This enables us to deal with the dynamic nature of the problem, since a relevance model is stable over time, while a topic model needs to be continuously retrained. We present the data collection and processing pipeline, as well as our methodology for achieving low latency, high precision recommendations. Our empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering more than 80% precision. Our techniques are implemented in a real-time system that is currently under user trial with a big news organisation."

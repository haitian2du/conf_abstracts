"Who Benefits from the ""Sharing"" Economy of Airbnb?","Sharing economy platforms have become extremely popular in the last few years, and they have changed the way in which we commute, travel, and borrow among many other activities. Despite their popularity among consumers, such companies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful examples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and policy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a false dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any regulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no evidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from the Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out where and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing information with census and hotel data, we determine the socio-economic conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform. The reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the years. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional regulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why, finally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are responsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of ``algorithmic regulation''."
Socialized Language Model Smoothing via Bi-directional Influence Propagation on Social Networks,"In recent years, online social networks are among the most popular websites with high PV (Page View) all over the world, as they have renewed the way for information discovery and distribution. Millions of users have registered on these websites and hence generate formidable amount of user-generated contents every day. The social networks become ""giants"", likely eligible to carry on any research tasks. However, we have pointed out that these giants still suffer from their ""Achilles Heel"", i.e., extreme sparsity. Compared with the extremely large data over the whole collection, individual posting documents such as microblogs seem to be too sparse to make a difference under various research scenarios, while actually these postings are different. In this paper we propose to tackle the Achilles Heel of social networks by smoothing the language model via influence propagation. To further our previously proposed work to tackle the sparsity issue, we extend the socialized language model smoothing with bi-directional influence learned from propagation. Intuitively, it is insufficient not to distinguish the influence propagated between information source and target without directions. Hence, we formulate a bi-directional socialized factor graph model, which utilizes both the textual correlations between document pairs and the socialized augmentation networks behind the documents, such as user relationships and social interactions. These factors are modeled as attributes and dependencies among documents and their corresponding users, and then are distinguished on the direction level. We propose an effective learning algorithm to learn the proposed factor graph model with directions. Finally we propagate term counts to smooth documents based on the estimated influence. We run experiments on two instinctive datasets of Twitter and Weibo. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. By incorporating direction information into the socialized language model smoothing, our approach obtains improvement over several alternative methods on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations measured in terms of perplexity, nDCG and MAP measurements."
Collaborative Nowcasting for Contextual Recommendation,"Mobile digital assistants such as Microsoft Cortana and Google Now currently offer appealing proactive experiences to users, which aim to deliver the right information at the right time. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to precisely predict users' real-time intent. Intent is closely related to context, which includes not only the spatial-temporal information but also users' current activities that can be sensed by mobile devices. The relationship between intent and context is highly dynamic and exhibits chaotic sequential correlation. The context itself is often sparse and heterogeneous. The dynamics and co-movement among contextual signals are also elusive and complicated. Traditional recommendation models cannot directly apply to proactive experiences because they fail to tackle the above challenges. Inspired by the nowcasting practice in meteorology and macroeconomics, we propose an innovative collaborative nowcasting model to effectively resolve these challenges. The proposed model successfully addresses sparsity and heterogeneity of contextual signals. It also effectively models the convoluted correlation within contextual signals and between context and intent. Specifically, the model first extracts collaborative latent factors, which summarize shared temporal structural patterns in contextual signals, and then exploits the collaborative Kalman Filter to generate serially correlated personalized latent factors, which are utilized to monitor each user's real-time intent. Extensive experiments with real-world data sets from a commercial digital assistant demonstrate the effectiveness of the collaborative nowcasting model. The studied problem and model provide inspiring implications for new paradigms of recommendations on mobile intelligent devices."

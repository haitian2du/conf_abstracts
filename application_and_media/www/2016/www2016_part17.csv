Exploiting Dining Preference for Restaurant Recommendation,"The wide adoption of location-based services provide the potential to understand people's mobility pattern at an unprecedented level, which can also enable food-service industry to accurately predict consumers' dining behavior. In this paper, based on users' dining implicit feedbacks (restaurant visit via check-ins), explicit feedbacks (restaurant reviews) as well as some meta data (e.g., location, user demographics, restaurant attributes), we aim at recommending each user a list of restaurants for his next dining. Implicit and Explicit feedbacks of dining behavior exhibit different characteristics of user preference. Therefore, in our work, user's dining preference mainly contains two parts: implicit preference coming from check-in data (implicit feedbacks) and explicit preference coming from rating and review data (explicit feedbacks). For implicit preference, we first apply a probabilistic tensor factorization model (PTF) to capture preference in a latent subspace. Then, in order to incorporate contextual signals from meta data, we extend PTF by proposing an Implicit Preference Model (IPM), which can simultaneously capture users'/restaurants'/time' preference in the collaborative filtering and dining preference in a specific context (e.g., spatial distance preference, environmental preference). For explicit preference, we propose Explicit Preference Model (EPM) by combining matrix factorization with topic modeling to discover the user preference embedded both in rating score and text content. Finally, we design a unified model termed as Collective Implicit Explicit Preference Model (CIEPM) to combine implicit and explicit preference together for restaurant recommendation. To evaluate the performance of our system, we conduct extensive experiments with large-scale datasets covering hundreds of thousands of users and restaurants. The results reveal that our system is effective for restaurant recommendation."
Non-Linear Mining of Competing Local Activities,"Given a large collection of time-evolving activities, such as Google search queries, which consist of d keywords/activities for m locations of duration n, how can we analyze temporal patterns and relationships among all these activities and find location-specific trends? How do we go about capturing non-linear evolutions of local activities and forecasting future patterns? For example, assume that we have the online search volume for multiple keywords, e.g., ""Nokia/Nexus/Kindle"" or ""CNN/BBC"" for 236 countries/territories, from 2004 to 2015. Our goal is to analyze a large collection of multi-evolving activities, and specifically, to answer the following questions: (a) Is there any sign of interaction/competition between two different keywords? If so, who competes with whom? (b) In which country is the competition strong? (c) Are there any seasonal/annual activities? (d) How can we automatically detect important world-wide (or local) events? We present COMPCUBE, a unifying non-linear model, which provides a compact and powerful representation of co-evolving activities; and also a novel fitting algorithm, COMPCUBE-FIT, which is parameter-free and scalable. Our method captures the following important patterns: (B)asic trends, i.e., non-linear dynamics of co-evolving activities, signs of (C)ompetition and latent interaction, e.g., Nokia vs. Nexus, (S)easonality, e.g., a Christmas spike for iPod in the U.S. and Europe, and (D)eltas, e.g., unrepeated local events such as the U.S. election in 2008. Thanks to its concise but effective summarization, COMPCUBE can also forecast long-range future activities. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that COMPCUBE consistently outperforms the best state-of- the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and execution speed."
PCT: Partial Co-Alignment of Social Networks,"People nowadays usually participate in multiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy more social network services. Besides the common users, social networks providing similar services can also share many other kinds of information entities, e.g., locations, videos and products. However, these shared information entities in different networks are mostly isolated without any known corresponding connections. In this paper, we aim at inferring such potential corresponding connections linking multiple kinds of shared entities across networks simultaneously. Formally, the problem is referred to as the network ""Partial Co-alignmenT"" (PCT) problem. PCT is an important problem and can be the prerequisite for many concrete cross-network applications, like social network fusion, mutual information exchange and transfer. Meanwhile, the PCT problem is also very challenging to address due to various reasons, like (1) the heterogeneity of social networks, (2) lack of training instances to build models, and (3) one-to-one constraint on the correspondence connections. To resolve these challenges, a novel unsupervised network alignment framework, UNICOAT (UNsupervIsed COncurrent AlignmenT)), is introduced in this paper. Based on the heterogeneous information, UNICOAT transforms the PCT problem into a joint optimization problem. To solve the objective function, the one-to-one constraint on the corresponding relationships is relaxed, and the redundant non-existing corresponding connections introduced by such a relaxation will be pruned with a novel network co-matching algorithm proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world co-aligned social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of UNICOAT in addressing the PCT problem."
Improving Post-Click User Engagement on Native Ads via Survival Analysis,"In this paper we focus on estimating the post-click engagement on native ads by predicting the dwell time on the corresponding ad landing pages. To infer relationships between features of the ads and dwell time we resort to the application of survival analysis techniques, which allow us to estimate the distribution of the length of time that the user will spend on the ad. This information is then integrated into the ad ranking function with the goal of promoting the rank of ads that are likely to be clicked and consumed by users (dwell time greater than a given threshold). The online evaluation over live traffic shows that considering post-click engagement has a consistent positive effect on both CTR, decreases the number of bounces and increases the average dwell time, hence leading to a better user post-click experience."

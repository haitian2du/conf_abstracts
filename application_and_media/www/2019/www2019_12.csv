"Rock, Rap, or Reggaeton?: Assessing Mexican Immigrants' Cultural Assimilation Using Facebook Data,","The degree to which Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are assimilating culturally has been widely debated. To examine this question, we focus on musical taste, a key symbolic resource that signals the social positions of individuals. We adapt an assimilation metric from earlier work to analyze self-reported musical interests among immigrants in Facebook. We use the relative levels of interest in musical genres, where a similarity to the host population in musical preferences is treated as evidence of cultural assimilation. Contrary to skeptics of Mexican assimilation, we find significant cultural convergence even among first-generation immigrants, which problematizes their use as assimilative “benchmarks” in the literature. Further, 2nd generation Mexican Americans show high cultural convergence vis-à-vis both Anglos and African-Americans, with the exception of those who speak Spanish. Rather than conforming to a single assimilation path, our findings reveal how Mexican immigrants defy simple unilinear theoretical expectations and illuminate their uniquely heterogeneous character."
Learning Intent to Book Metrics for Airbnb Search,"Airbnb is a two-sided rental marketplace offering a variety of unique and more traditional accommodation options. Similar to other online marketplaces we invest in optimizing the content surfaced on the search UI and ranking relevance to improve the guest online search experience. The unique Airbnb inventory, however, surfaces some major data challenges. Given the high stakes of booking less traditional accommodations, users can spend many days to weeks searching and scanning the description page of many accommodation ”listings” before making a decision to book. Moreover, much of the information about a listing is unstructured and can only be found by the user after they go through the details on the listing page. As a result, we have found traditional search metrics do not work well in the context of our platform. Basic metrics of single user actions, such as click-through-rates, number of listings viewed, or dwell time, are not consistently directionally correlated with our downstream business metrics. To address these issues we leverage machine learning to isolate signals of intent from rich behavioral data. These signals have key applications including analytical insights, ranking modeling inputs, and experimentation velocity. In this paper, we describe the development of a model-based user intent metric, ”intentful listing view”, which combines the signals of a variety of user micro-actions on the listing description page. We demonstrate this learned metric is directionally correlated with downstream conversion metrics and sensitive across a variety of historical search experiments."
Detection and Analysis of Self-Disclosure in Online News Commentaries,"Online users engage in self-disclosure - revealing personal information to others - in pursuit of social rewards. However, there are associated costs of disclosure to users' privacy. User profiling techniques support the use of contributed content for a number of purposes, e.g., micro-targeting advertisements. In this paper, we study self-disclosure as it occurs in newspaper comment forums. We explore a longitudinal dataset of about 60,000 comments on 2202 news articles from four major English news websites. We start with detection of language indicative of various types of self-disclosure, leveraging both syntactic and semantic information present in texts. Specifically, we use dependency parsing for subject, verb, and object extraction from sentences, in conjunction with named entity recognition to extract linguistic indicators of self-disclosure. We then use these indicators to examine the effects of anonymity and topic of discussion on self-disclosure. We find that anonymous users are more likely to self-disclose than identifiable users, and that self-disclosure varies across topics of discussion. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for user privacy."
ViTOR: Learning to Rank Webpages Based on Visual Features,"The visual appearance of a webpage carries valuable information about the page's quality and can be used to improve the performance of learning to rank (LTR). We introduce the Visual learning TO Rank (ViTOR) model that integrates state-of-the-art visual features extraction methods: (i) transfer learning from a pre-trained image classification model, and (ii) synthetic saliency heat maps generated from webpage snapshots. Since there is currently no public dataset for the task of LTR with visual features, we also introduce and release the ViTOR dataset, containing visually rich and diverse webpages. The ViTOR dataset consists of visual snapshots, non-visual features and relevance judgments for ClueWeb12 webpages and TREC Web Track queries. We experiment with the proposed ViTOR model on the ViTOR dataset and show that it significantly improves the performance of LTR with visual features."
Evaluating Neural Text Simplification in the Medical Domain,"Health literacy, i.e. the ability to read and understand medical text, is a relevant component of public health. Unfortunately, many medical texts are hard to grasp by the general population as they are targeted at highly-skilled professionals and use complex language and domain-specific terms. Here, automatic text simplification making text commonly understandable would be very beneficial. However, research and development into medical text simplification is hindered by the lack of openly available training and test corpora which contain complex medical sentences and their aligned simplified versions. In this paper, we introduce such a dataset to aid medical text simplification research. The dataset is created by filtering aligned health sentences using expert knowledge from an existing aligned corpus and a novel simple, language independent monolingual text alignment method. Furthermore, we use the dataset to train a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model, and compare it to a model trained on a general simplification dataset using an automatic evaluation, and an extensive human-expert evaluation."
Semantic Hilbert Space for Text Representation Learning,"Capturing the meaning of sentences has long been a challenging task. Current models tend to apply linear combinations of word features to conduct semantic composition for bigger-granularity units e.g. phrases, sentences, and documents. However, the semantic linearity does not always hold in human language. For instance, the meaning of the phrase “ivory tower” cannot be deduced by linearly combining the meanings of “ivory” and “tower”. To address this issue, we propose a new framework that models different levels of semantic units (e.g. sememe, word, sentence, and semantic abstraction) on a single Semantic Hilbert Space, which naturally admits a non-linear semantic composition by means of a complex-valued vector word representation. An end-to-end neural network 1 is proposed to implement the framework in the text classification task, and evaluation results on six benchmarking text classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and self-explanation power of the proposed model. Furthermore, intuitive case studies are conducted to help end users to understand how the framework works."
Learning Task-Specific City Region Partition,"The proliferation of publicly accessible urban data provide new insights on various urban tasks. A frequently used approach is to treat each region as a data sample and build a model over all the regions to observe the correlations between urban features (e.g., demographics) and the target variable (e.g., crime count). To define regions, most existing studies use fixed grids or pre-defined administrative boundaries (e.g., census tracts or community areas). In reality, however, definitions of regions should be different depending on tasks (e.g., regional crime count prediction vs. real estate prices estimation). In this paper, we propose a new problem of task-specific city region partitioning, aiming to find the best partition in a city w.r.t. a given task. We prove this is an NP-hard search problem with no trivial solution. To learn the partition, we first study two variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We further propose a reinforcement learning scheme for effective sampling the search space. We conduct experiments on two real datasets in Chicago (i.e., crime count and real estate price) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks for Recommender Systems,"To alleviate sparsity and cold start problem of collaborative filtering based recommender systems, researchers and engineers usually collect attributes of users and items, and design delicate algorithms to exploit these additional information. In general, the attributes are not isolated but connected with each other, which forms a knowledge graph (KG). In this paper, we propose Knowledge Graph Convolutional Networks (KGCN), an end-to-end framework that captures inter-item relatedness effectively by mining their associated attributes on the KG. To automatically discover both high-order structure information and semantic information of the KG, we sample from the neighbors for each entity in the KG as their receptive field, then combine neighborhood information with bias when calculating the representation of a given entity. The receptive field can be extended to multiple hops away to model high-order proximity information and capture users' potential long-distance interests. Moreover, we implement the proposed KGCN in a minibatch fashion, which enables our model to operate on large datasets and KGs. We apply the proposed model to three datasets about movie, book, and music recommendation, and experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong recommender baselines."
Tag2Vec: Learning Tag Representations in Tag Networks,"Network embedding is a method to learn low-dimensional representation vectors for nodes in complex networks. In real networks, nodes may have multiple tags but existing methods ignore the abundant semantic and hierarchical information of tags. This information is useful to many network applications and usually very stable. In this paper, we propose a tag representation learning model, Tag2Vec, which mixes nodes and tags into a hybrid network. Firstly, for tag networks, we define semantic distance as the proximity between tags and design a novel strategy, parameterized random walk, to generate context with semantic and hierarchical information of tags adaptively. Then, we propose hyperbolic Skip-gram model to express the complex hierarchical structure better with lower output dimensions. We evaluate our model on the NBER U.S. patent dataset and WordNet dataset. The results show that our model can learn tag representations with rich semantic information and it outperforms other baselines."
The Silent Majority Speaks: Inferring Silent Users' Opinions in Online Social Networks,"With the blossoming of social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook, how to infer the opinions of online social network users on specific topics they had not directly given yet, has received much attention. Existing solutions mainly rely on one's previous posted messages. However, recent studies show that over 40% of users opt to be silent all or most of the time and post very few messages. Consequently, the performance of existing solutions will drop dramatically when they are applied to infer silent users' opinions, and how to infer the opinions of these silent users becomes a meaningful while challenging task. Inspired by the collaborative filtering techniques in cold-start recommendations, we infer the opinions of silent users by leveraging the text content posted by active users and their relationships between silent users. Specifically, we first consider both observed and pseudo relationships among users, and cluster users into communities in order to extract various kinds of features for opinion inference. We then design a coupled sparse matrix factorization (CSMF) model to capture the complex relations among these features. Extensive experiments on real-world data from Twitter show that our CSMF model achieves over 80% accuracy for the inference of silent users' opinions."
A Novel Unsupervised Approach for Precise Temporal Slot Filling from Incomplete and Noisy Temporal Contexts,"The task of temporal slot filling (TSF) is to extract the values (or called facts) of specific attributes for a given entity from text data and find the time points when the values were valid. It is challenging to find precise time points with incomplete and noisy temporal contexts in the text. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach of two modules that mutually enhance each other: one is a reliability estimator on fact extractors conditionally to the temporal contexts; the other is a fact trustworthiness estimator based on the extractor's reliability. The iterative learning process reduces the noise of the extractions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach, with the novel design, can accurately and efficiently extract precise temporal facts from newspaper corpora."
Learning Binary Hash Codes for Fast Anchor Link Retrieval across Networks,"Users are usually involved in multiple social networks, without explicit anchor links that reveal the correspondence among different accounts of the same user across networks. Anchor link prediction aims to identify the hidden anchor links, which is a fundamental problem for user profiling, information cascading, and cross-domain recommendation. Although existing methods perform well in the accuracy of anchor link prediction, the pairwise search manners on inferring anchor links suffer from big challenge when being deployed in practical systems. To combat the challenges, in this paper we propose a novel embedding and matching architecture to directly learn binary hash code for each node. Hash codes offer us an efficient index to filter out the candidate node pairs for anchor link prediction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world large-scale datasets demonstrate that our proposed method has high time efficiency without loss of competitive prediction accuracy in anchor link prediction."
Neural Chinese Named Entity Recognition via CNN-LSTM-CRF and Joint Training with Word Segmentation,"Chinese named entity recognition (CNER) is an important task in Chinese natural language processing field. However, CNER is very challenging since Chinese entity names are highly context-dependent. In addition, Chinese texts lack delimiters to separate words, making it difficult to identify the boundary of entities. Besides, the training data for CNER in many domains is usually insufficient, and annotating enough training data for CNER is very expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a neural approach for CNER. First, we introduce a CNN-LSTM-CRF neural architecture to capture both local and long-distance contexts for CNER. Second, we propose a unified framework to jointly train CNER and word segmentation models in order to enhance the ability of CNER model in identifying entity boundaries. Third, we introduce an automatic method to generate pseudo labeled samples from existing labeled data which can enrich the training data. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of Chinese named entity recognition, especially when training data is insufficient."
Semi-supervised Multi-view Individual and Sharable Feature Learning for Webpage Classification,"Semi-supervised multi-view feature learning (SMFL) is a feasible solution for webpage classification. However, how to fully extract the complementarity and correlation information effectively under semi-supervised setting has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised multi-view individual and sharable feature learning (SMISFL) approach, which jointly learns multiple view-individual transformations and one sharable transformation to explore the view-specific property for each view and the common property across views. We design a semi-supervised multi-view similarity preserving term, which fully utilizes the label information of labeled samples and similarity information of unlabeled samples from both intra-view and inter-view aspects. To promote learning of diversity, we impose a constraint on view-individual transformation to make the learned view-specific features to be statistically uncorrelated. Furthermore, we train a linear classifier, such that view-specific and shared features can be effectively combined for classification. Experiments on widely used webpage datasets demonstrate that SMISFL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art SMFL and webpage classification methods."
On Convexity and Bounds of Fairness-aware Classification,"In this paper, we study the fairness-aware classification problem by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem. Several limitations exist in previous works due to the lack of a theoretical framework for guiding the formulation. We propose a general fairness-aware framework to address previous limitations. Our framework provides: (1) various fairness metrics that can be incorporated into classic classification models as constraints; (2) the convex constrained optimization problem that can be solved efficiently; and (3) the lower and upper bounds of real-world fairness measures that are established using surrogate functions, providing a fairness guarantee for constrained classifiers. Within the framework, we propose a constraint-free criterion under which any learned classifier is guaranteed to be fair in terms of the specified fairness metric. If the constraint-free criterion fails to satisfy, we further develop the method based on the bounds for constructing fair classifiers. The experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate our theoretical results and show the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
Understanding Urban Dynamics via State-sharing Hidden Markov Model,"Modeling people's activities in the urban space is a crucial socio-economic task but extremely challenging due to the deficiency of suitable methods. To model the temporal dynamics of human activities concisely and specifically, we present State-sharing Hidden Markov Model (SSHMM). First, it extracts the urban states from the whole city, which captures the volume of population flows as well as the frequency of each type of Point of Interests (PoIs) visited. Second, it characterizes the urban dynamics of each urban region as the state transition on the shared-states, which reveals distinct daily rhythms of urban activities. We evaluate our method via a large-scale real-life mobility dataset and results demonstrate that SSHMM learns semantics-rich urban dynamics, which are highly correlated with the functions of the region. Besides, it recovers the urban dynamics in different time slots with an error of 0.0793, which outperforms the general HMM by 54.2%."
Efficient Path Prediction for Semi-Supervised and Weakly Supervised Hierarchical Text Classification,"Hierarchical text classification has many real-world applications. However, labeling a large number of documents is costly. In practice, we can use semi-supervised learning or weakly supervised learning (e.g., dataless classification) to reduce the labeling cost. In this paper, we propose a path cost-sensitive learning algorithm to utilize the structural information and further make use of unlabeled and weakly-labeled data. We use a generative model to leverage the large amount of unlabeled data and introduce path constraints into the learning algorithm to incorporate the structural information of the class hierarchy. The posterior probabilities of both unlabeled and weakly labeled data can be incorporated with path-dependent scores. Since we put a structure-sensitive cost to the learning algorithm to constrain the classification consistent with the class hierarchy and do not need to reconstruct the feature vectors for different structures, we can significantly reduce the computational cost compared to structural output learning. Experimental results on two hierarchical text classification benchmarks show that our approach is not only effective but also efficient to handle the semi-supervised and weakly supervised hierarchical text classification."
Hierarchical Neural Variational Model for Personalized Sequential Recommendation,"In this paper, we study the problem of recommending personalized items to users given their sequential behaviors. Most sequential recommendation models only capture a user's short-term preference in a short session, and neglect his general (unchanged over time) and long-term preferences. Besides, they are all based on deterministic neural networks, and consider users' latent preferences as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space. However, in real world, the evolutions of users' preferences are full of uncertainties. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical neural variational model (HNVM). HNVM models users' three preferences: general, long-term and short-term preferences through an unified hierarchical deep generative process. HNVM is a hierarchical recurrent neural network that enables it to capture both user's long-term and short-term preferences. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that HNVM outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods."
Focusing Attention Network for Answer Ranking,"Answer ranking is an important task in Community Question Answering (CQA), by which “Good” answers should be ranked in the front of “Bad” or “Potentially Useful” answers. The state of the art is the attention-based classification framework that learns the mapping between the questions and the answers. However, we observe that existing attention-based methods perform poorly on complicated question-answer pairs. One major reason is that existing methods cannot get accurate alignments between questions and answers for such pairs. We call the phenomenon “attention divergence”. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, called Focusing Attention Network(FAN), which can automatically draw back the divergent attention by adding the semantic, and metadata features. Our Model can focus on the most important part of the sentence and therefore improve the answer ranking performance. Experimental results on the CQA dataset of SemEval-2016 and SemEval-2017 demonstrate that our method respectively attains 79.38 and 88.72 on MAP and outperforms the Top-1 system in the shared task by 0.19 and 0.29."
DLocRL: A Deep Learning Pipeline for Fine-Grained Location Recognition and Linking in Tweets,"In recent years, with the prevalence of social media and smart devices, people causally reveal their locations such as shops, hotels, and restaurants in their tweets. Recognizing and linking such fine-grained location mentions to well-defined location profiles are beneficial for retrieval and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose DLocRL, a new deep learning pipeline for fine-grained location recognition and linking in tweets, and verify its effectiveness on a real-world Twitter dataset."
Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Sequential Recommendation,"The sequential recommendation, which models sequential behavioral patterns among users for the recommendation, plays a critical role in recommender systems. However, the state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) solutions rarely consider the non-linear feature interactions and non-monotone short-term sequential patterns, which are essential for user behavior modeling in sparse sequence data. In this paper, we propose a novel Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network model (RCNN). It not only utilizes the recurrent architecture of RNN to capture complex long-term dependencies, but also leverages the convolutional operation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract short-term sequential patterns among recurrent hidden states. Specifically, we first generate a hidden state at each time step with the recurrent layer. Then the recent hidden states are regarded as an “image”, and RCNN searches non-linear feature interactions and non-monotone local patterns via intra-step horizontal and inter-step vertical convolutional filters, respectively. Moreover, the output of convolutional filters and the hidden state are concatenated and fed into a fully-connected layer to generate the recommendation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model using four real-world datasets from various application scenarios. The experimental results show that our model RCNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on sequential recommendation."
No More than What I Post: Preventing Linkage Attacks on Check-in Services,"With the flourishing of location based social networks, posting check-ins has become a common practice to document one's daily life. Users usually do not consider check-in records as violations of their privacy. However, through analyzing two real-world check-in datasets, our study shows that check-in records are vulnerable to linkage attacks. To address this problem, we design a partition-and-group framework to integrate the information of check-ins and additional mobility data to attain a novel privacy criterion - kt, l-anonymity. It ensures adversaries with arbitrary background knowledge cannot use check-ins to re-identify users in other anonymous datasets or learning unreported mobility records. The proposed framework achieves favorable performance against state-of-art baseline in terms of improving check-in utility by 24% ~ 57% while providing stronger privacy guarantee at the same time. We believe this study will open a new angle in attaining both privacy-preserving and useful check-in services."
Open-world Learning and Application to Product Classification,"Classic supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption that the classes seen in testing must have appeared in training. However, this assumption is often violated in real-world applications. For example, in a social media site, new topics emerge constantly and in e-commerce, new categories of products appear daily. A model that cannot detect new/unseen topics or products is hard to function well in such open environments. A desirable model working in such environments must be able to (1) reject examples from unseen classes (not appeared in training) and (2) incrementally learn the new/unseen classes to expand the existing model. This is called open-world learning (OWL). This paper proposes a new OWL method based on meta-learning. The key novelty is that the model maintains only a dynamic set of seen classes that allows new classes to be added or deleted with no need for model re-training. Each class is represented by a small set of training examples. In testing, the meta-classifier only uses the examples of the maintained seen classes (including the newly added classes) on-the-fly for classification and rejection. Experimental results with e-commerce product classification show that the proposed method is highly effective1."
Place Deduplication with Embeddings,"Thanks to the advancing mobile location services, people nowadays can post about places to share visiting experience on-the-go. A large place graph not only helps users explore interesting destinations, but also provides opportunities for understanding and modeling the real world. To improve coverage and flexibility of the place graph, many platforms import places data from multiple sources, which unfortunately leads to the emergence of numerous duplicated places that severely hinder subsequent location-related services. In this work, we take the anonymous place graph from Facebook as an example to systematically study the problem of place deduplication: We carefully formulate the problem, study its connections to various related tasks that lead to several promising basic models, and arrive at a systematic two-step data-driven pipeline based on place embedding with multiple novel techniques that works significantly better than the state-of-the-art."
Cyberbullying Ends Here: Towards Robust Detection of Cyberbullying in Social Media,"The potentially detrimental effects of cyberbullying have led to the development of numerous automated, data-driven approaches, with emphasis on classification accuracy. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well-defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of aggressive messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim. Existing work has focused on harassment (i.e., using profanity to classify toxic comments independently) as an indicator of cyberbullying, disregarding the repetitive nature of this harassing process. However, raising a cyberbullying alert immediately after an aggressive comment is detected can lead to a high number of false positives. At the same time, two key practical challenges remain unaddressed: (i) detection timeliness, which is necessary to support victims as early as possible, and (ii) scalability to the staggering rates at which content is generated in online social networks."
Enhancing Fashion Recommendation with Visual Compatibility Relationship,"With the increasing of online shopping services, fashion recommendation plays an important role in daily online shopping scenes. A lot of recommender systems have been developed with visual information. However, few works take into account compatibility relationship when they are generating recommendations. The challenge is that fashion concept is often subtle and subjective for different customers. In this paper, we propose a fashion compatibility knowledge learning method that incorporates visual compatibility relationships as well as style information. We also propose a fashion recommendation method with domain adaptation strategy to alleviate the distribution gap between the items in target domain and the items of external compatible outfits. Our results indicate that the proposed method is capable of learning visual compatibility knowledge and outperforms all the baselines."
Discovering Product Defects and Solutions from Online User Generated Contents,"The recent increase in online user generated content (UGC) has led to the availability of a large number of posts about products and services. Often, these posts contain complaints that the consumers purchasing the products and services have. However, discovering and summarizing product defects and the related knowledge from large quantities of user posts is a difficult task. Traditional aspect opinion mining models, that aim to discover the product aspects and their corresponding opinions, are not sufficient to discover the product defect information from the user posts. In this paper, we propose the Product Defect Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (PDLDA), a probabilistic model that identifies domain-specific knowledge about product issues using interdependent three-dimensional topics: Component, Symptom, and Resolution. A Gibbs sampling based inference method for PDLDA is also introduced. To evaluate our model, we introduce three novel product review datasets. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the proposed model results in apparent improvement in the quality of discovered product defect information. Our model has the potential to benefit customers, manufacturers, and policy makers, by automatically discovering product defects from online data."
Your Style Your Identity: Leveraging Writing and Photography Styles for Drug Trafficker Identification in Darknet Markets over Attributed Heterogeneous Information Network,"Due to its anonymity, there has been a dramatic growth of underground drug markets hosted in the darknet (e.g., Dream Market and Valhalla). To combat drug trafficking (a.k.a. illicit drug trading) in the cyberspace, there is an urgent need for automatic analysis of participants in darknet markets. However, one of the key challenges is that drug traffickers (i.e., vendors) may maintain multiple accounts across different markets or within the same market. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose and develop an intelligent system named uStyle-uID leveraging both writing and photography styles for drug trafficker identification at the first attempt. At the core of uStyle-uID is an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) which elegantly integrates both writing and photography styles along with the text and photo contents, as well as other supporting attributes (i.e., trafficker and drug information) and various kinds of relations. Built on the constructed AHIN, to efficiently measure the relatedness over nodes (i.e., traffickers) in the constructed AHIN, we propose a new network embedding model Vendor2Vec to learn the low-dimensional representations for the nodes in AHIN, which leverages complementary attribute information attached in the nodes to guide the meta-path based random walk for path instances sampling. After that, we devise a learning model named vIdentifier to classify if a given pair of traffickers are the same individual. Comprehensive experiments on the data collections from four different darknet markets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of uStyle-uID which integrates our proposed method in drug trafficker identification by comparisons with alternative approaches."
Abstractive Meeting Summarization via Hierarchical Adaptive Segmental Network Learning,"Abstractive meeting summarization is a challenging problem in natural language understanding, which automatically generates the condensed summary covering the important points in the meeting conversation. However, the existing abstractive summarization works mainly focus on the structured text documents, which may be ineffectively applied to the meeting summarization task due to the lack of modeling the unstructured long-form conversational contents. In this paper, we consider the problem of abstractive meeting summarization from the viewpoint of hierarchical adaptive segmental encoder-decoder network learning. We propose the hierarchical neural encoder based on adaptive recurrent networks to learn the semantic representation of meeting conversation with adaptive conversation segmentation. We then develop the reinforced decoder network to generate the high-quality summaries for abstractive meeting summarization. We conduct the extensive experiments on the well-known AMI meeting conversation dataset to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Adversarial Point-of-Interest Recommendation,"Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is essential to a variety of services for both users and business. An extensive number of models have been developed to improve the recommendation performance by exploiting various characteristics and relations among POIs (e.g., spatio-temporal, social, etc.). However, very few studies closely look into the underlying mechanism accounting for why users prefer certain POIs to others. In this work, we initiate the first attempt to learn the distribution of user latent preference by proposing an Adversarial POI Recommendation (APOIR) model, consisting of two major components: (1) the recommender (R) which suggests POIs based on the learned distribution by maximizing the probabilities that these POIs are predicted as unvisited and potentially interested; and (2) the discriminator (D) which distinguishes the recommended POIs from the true check-ins and provides gradients as the guidance to improve R in a rewarding framework. Two components are co-trained by playing a minimax game towards improving itself while pushing the other to the boundary. By further integrating geographical and social relations among POIs into the reward function as well as optimizing R in a reinforcement learning manner, APOIR obtains significant performance improvement in four standard metrics compared to the state of the art methods."

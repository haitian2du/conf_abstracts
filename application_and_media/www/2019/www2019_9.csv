Rating Augmentation with Generative Adversarial Networks towards Accurate Collaborative Filtering,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have not only achieved a big success in various generation tasks such as images, but also boosted the accuracy of classification tasks by generating additional labeled data, which is called data augmentation. In this paper, we propose a Rating Augmentation framework with GAN, named RAGAN, aiming to alleviate the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering (CF), eventually improving recommendation accuracy significantly. We identify a unique challenge that arises when applying GAN to CF for rating augmentation: naive RAGAN tends to generate values biased towards high ratings. Then, we propose a refined version of RAGAN, named RAGANBT, which addresses this challenge successfully. Via our extensive experiments, we validate that our RAGANBT is really effective to solve the data sparsity problem, thereby providing existing CF models with great improvement in accuracy under various situations such as basic top-N recommendation, long-tail item recommendation, and recommendation to cold-start users."
On the Impact of Choice Architectures on Inequality in Online Donation Platforms,"Online donation platforms, such as DonorsChoose, GlobalGiving, or CrowdFunder, enable donors to financially support entities in need. In a typical scenario, after a fundraiser submits a request specifying her need, donors contribute financially to help raise the target amount within a pre-specified timeframe. While the goal of such platforms is to counterbalance societal inequalities, biased donation trends might exacerbate the unfair distribution of resources to those in need. Prior research has looked at the impact of biased data, models, or human behavior on inequality in different socio-technical systems, while largely ignoring the choice architecture, in which the funding decisions are made."
Multi-Domain Gated CNN for Review Helpfulness Prediction,"Consumers today face too many reviews to read when shopping online. Presenting the most helpful reviews, instead of all, to them will greatly ease purchase decision making. Most of the existing studies on review helpfulness prediction focused on domains with rich labels, not suitable for domains with insufficient labels. In response, we explore a multi-domain approach that learns domain relationships to help the task by transferring knowledge from data-rich domains to data-deficient domains. To better model domain differences, our approach gates multi-granularity embeddings in a Neural Network (NN) based transfer learning framework to reflect the domain-variant importance of words. Extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and NN-based methods without gating on this task. Our approach facilitates more effective knowledge transfer between domains, especially when the target domain dataset is small. Meanwhile, the domain relationship and domain-specific embedding gating are insightful and interpretable."
Collaborative Similarity Embedding for Recommender Systems,"We present collaborative similarity embedding (CSE), a unified framework that exploits comprehensive collaborative relations available in a user-item bipartite graph for representation learning and recommendation. In the proposed framework, we differentiate two types of proximity relations: direct proximity and k-th order neighborhood proximity. While learning from the former exploits direct user-item associations observable from the graph, learning from the latter makes use of implicit associations such as user-user similarities and item-item similarities, which can provide valuable information especially when the graph is sparse. Moreover, for improving scalability and flexibility, we propose a sampling technique that is specifically designed to capture the two types of proximity relations. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show that CSE yields significantly better performance than state-of-the-art recommendation methods."
Sampled in Pairs and Driven by Text: A New Graph Embedding Framework,"In graphs with rich texts, incorporating textual information with structural information would benefit constructing expressive graph embeddings. Among various graph embedding models, random walk (RW)-based is one of the most popular and successful groups. However, it is challenged by two issues when applied on graphs with rich texts: (i) sampling efficiency: deriving from the training objective of RW-based models (e.g., DeepWalk and node2vec), we show that RW-based models are likely to generate large amounts of redundant training samples due to three main drawbacks. (ii) text utilization: these models have difficulty in dealing with zero-shot scenarios where graph embedding models have to infer graph structures directly from texts. To solve these problems, we propose a novel framework, namely Text-driven Graph Embedding with Pairs Sampling (TGE-PS). TGE-PS uses Pairs Sampling (PS) to improve the sampling strategy of RW, being able to reduce ~ 99% training samples while preserving competitive performance. TGE-PS uses Text-driven Graph Embedding (TGE), an inductive graph embedding approach, to generate node embeddings from texts. Since each node contains rich texts, TGE is able to generate high-quality embeddings and provide reasonable predictions on existence of links to unseen nodes. We evaluate TGE-PS on several real-world datasets, and experiment results demonstrate that TGE-PS produces state-of-the-art results on both traditional and zero-shot link prediction tasks."
BoFGAN: Towards A New Structure of Backward-or-Forward Generative Adversarial Nets,"Natural Language Generation (NLG), as an important part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has begun to take full advantage of recent advances in language models. Based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), NLG has made ground breaking improvement and is widely applied in many tasks. RNNs typically learn a joint probability of words, and the additional information is usually fed to RNNs hidden layer using implicit vector representations. Still, there exists some problem unsolved. Standard RNN is not applicable when we need to impose hard constraints on the language generation tasks: for example, standard RNNs cannot guarantee designated word(s) to appear in a target sentence to generate. In this paper, we propose a Backward-or-Forward Generative Adversarial Nets model (BoFGAN) to address this problem. Starting from a particular given word, a generative model at every time step generates a new preceding or subsequent word conditioned on the generated sequence so far until both sides reach an end. To train the generator, we first model it as a stochastic policy using Reinforcement Learning; then we employ a discriminator to evaluate the quality of a complete sequence as the end reward; and lastly, we apply Monte Carlo (MC) search to estimate the long-term return and update the generator via policy gradient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed BoFGAN model."
Outage Prediction and Diagnosis for Cloud Service Systems,"With the rapid growth of cloud service systems and their increasing complexity, service failures become unavoidable. Outages, which are critical service failures, could dramatically degrade system availability and impact user experience. To minimize service downtime and ensure high system availability, we develop an intelligent outage management approach, called AirAlert, which can forecast the occurrence of outages before they actually happen and diagnose the root cause after they indeed occur. AirAlert works as a global watcher for the entire cloud system, which collects all alerting signals, detects dependency among signals and proactively predicts outages that may happen anywhere in the whole cloud system. We analyze the relationships between outages and alerting signals by leveraging Bayesian network and predict outages using a robust gradient boosting tree based classification method. The proposed outage management approach is evaluated using the outage dataset collected from a Microsoft cloud system and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
What Makes a Good Team? A Large-scale Study on the Effect of Team Composition in Honor of Kings,"Team composition is a central factor in determining the effectiveness of a team. In this paper, we present a large-scale study on the effect of team composition on multiple measures of team effectiveness. We use a dataset from the largest multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, Honor of Kings, with 96 million matches involving 100 million players. We measure team effectiveness based on team performance (whether a team is going to win), team tenacity (whether a team is going to surrender), and team rapport (whether a team uses abusive language). Our results confirm the importance of team diversity with respect to player roles, and show that diversity has varying effects on team effectiveness: although diverse teams perform well and show tenacity in adversity, they are more likely to abuse when losing than less diverse teams. Our study also contributes to the situation vs. personality debate and show that abusive players tend to choose the leading role and players do not become more abusive when taking such roles."
TiFi: Taxonomy Induction for Fictional Domains,"Taxonomies are important building blocks of structured knowledge bases, and their construction from text sources and Wikipedia has received much attention. In this paper we focus on the construction of taxonomies for fictional domains, using noisy category systems from fan wikis or text extraction as input. Such fictional domains are archetypes of entity universes that are poorly covered by Wikipedia, such as also enterprise-specific knowledge bases or highly specialized verticals. Our fiction-targeted approach, called TiFi, consists of three phases: (i) category cleaning, by identifying candidate categories that truly represent classes in the domain of interest, (ii) edge cleaning, by selecting subcategory relationships that correspond to class subsumption, and (iii) top-level construction, by mapping classes onto a subset of high-level WordNet categories. A comprehensive evaluation shows that TiFi is able to construct taxonomies for a diverse range of fictional domains such as Lord of the Rings, The Simpsons or Greek Mythology with very high precision and that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for taxonomy induction by a substantial margin."
Deriving User- and Content-specific Rewards for Contextual Bandits,"Bandit algorithms have gained increased attention in recommender systems, as they provide effective and scalable recommendations. These algorithms use reward functions, usually based on a numeric variable such as click-through rates, as the basis for optimization. On a popular music streaming service, a contextual bandit algorithm is used to decide which content to recommend to users, where the reward function is a binarization of a numeric variable that defines success based on a static threshold of user streaming time: 1 if the user streamed for at least 30 seconds and 0 otherwise. We explore alternative methods to provide a more informed reward function, based on the assumptions that streaming time distribution heavily depends on the type of user and the type of content being streamed. To automatically extract user and content groups from streaming data, we employ ”co-clustering”, an unsupervised learning technique to simultaneously extract clusters of rows and columns from a co-occurrence matrix. The streaming distributions within the co-clusters are then used to define rewards specific to each co-cluster. Our proposed co-clustered based reward functions lead to improvement of over 25% in expected stream rate, compared to the standard binarized rewards."
Pcard: Personalized Restaurants Recommendation from Card Payment Transaction Records,"Personalized Point of Interest (POI) recommendation that incorporates users' personal preferences is an important subject of research. However, challenges exist such as dealing with sparse rating data and spatial location factors. As one of the biggest card payment organizations in the United States, our company holds abundant card payment transaction records with numerous features."
Improving Multiclass Classification in Crowdsourcing by Using Hierarchical Schemes,"In this paper, we propose a method of improving accuracy of multiclass classification tasks in crowdsourcing. In crowdsourcing, it is important to assign appropriate workers to appropriate tasks. In multiclass classification, different workers are good at different subcategories. In our method, we reorganize a given flat classification task into a hierarchical classification task consisting of several subtasks, and assign each worker to an appropriate subtask. In this approach, it is important to choose a good hierarchy. In our method, we first post a flat classification task with a part of data and collect statistics on each worker's ability. Based on the obtained statistics, we simulate all candidate hierarchical schemes, estimate their expected accuracy, choose the best scheme, and post it with the rest of data. In our method, it is also important to allocate workers to appropriate subtasks. We designed several greedy worker allocation algorithms. The results of our experiments show that our method improves the accuracy of multiclass classification tasks."
Modeling the Factors of User Success in Online Debate,"Debate is a process that gives individuals the opportunity to express, and to be exposed to, diverging viewpoints on controversial issues; and the existence of online debating platforms makes it easier for individuals to participate in debates and obtain feedback on their debating skills. But understanding the factors that contribute to a user's success in debate is complicated: while success depends, in part, on the characteristics of the language they employ, it is also important to account for the degree to which their beliefs and personal traits are compatible with that of the audience. Friendships and previous interactions among users on the platform may further influence success."
HopRank: How Semantic Structure Influences Teleportation in PageRank (A Case Study on BioPortal),"This paper introduces HopRank, an algorithm for modeling human navigation on semantic networks. HopRank leverages the assumption that users know or can see the whole structure of the network. Therefore, besides following links, they also follow nodes at certain distances (i.e., k-hop neighborhoods), and not at random as suggested by PageRank, which assumes only links are known or visible. We observe such preference towards k-hop neighborhoods on BioPortal, one of the leading repositories of biomedical ontologies on the Web. In general, users navigate within the vicinity of a concept. But they also “jump” to distant concepts less frequently. We fit our model on 11 ontologies using the transition matrix of clickstreams, and show that semantic structure can influence teleportation in PageRank. This suggests that users-to some extent-utilize knowledge about the underlying structure of ontologies, and leverage it to reach certain pieces of information. Our results help the development and improvement of user interfaces for ontology exploration."
Product-Aware Helpfulness Prediction of Online Reviews,"Helpful reviews are essential for e-commerce and review websites, as they can help customers make quick purchase decisions and merchants to increase profits. Due to a great number of online reviews with unknown helpfulness, it recently leads to promising research on building automatic mechanisms to assess review helpfulness. The mainstream methods generally extract various linguistic and embedding features solely from the text of a review as the evidence for helpfulness prediction. We, however, consider that the helpfulness of a review should be fully aware of the metadata (such as the title, the brand, the category, and the description) of its target product, besides the textual content of the review itself. Hence, in this paper we propose an end-to-end deep neural architecture directly fed by both the metadata of a product and the raw text of its reviews to acquire product-aware review representations for helpfulness prediction. The learned representations do not require tedious labor on feature engineering and are expected to be more informative as the target-aware evidence to assess the helpfulness of online reviews. We also construct two large-scale datasets which are a portion of the real-world web data in Amazon and Yelp, respectively, to train and test our approach. Experiments are conducted on two different tasks: helpfulness identification and regression of online reviews, and results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance with substantial improvements."
The World Wants Mangoes and Kangaroos: A Study of New Emoji Requests Based on Thirty Million Tweets,"As emojis become prevalent in personal communications, people are always looking for new, interesting emojis to express emotions, show attitudes, or simply visualize texts. In this study, we collected more than thirty million tweets mentioning the word “emoji” in a one-year period to study emoji requests on Twitter. First, we filtered out bot-generated tweets and extracted emoji requests from the raw tweets using a comprehensive list of linguistic patterns. Then, we examined patterns of new emoji requests by exploring their time, locations, and context. Finally, we summarized users' advocacy behaviors and identified expressions of equity, diversity, and fairness issues due to unreleased but expected emojis, and concluded the significance of new emojis on society. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to conduct a systematic, large-scale study on new emoji requests."
Online Learning for Measuring Incentive Compatibility in Ad Auctions?,"In this paper we investigate the problem of measuring end-to-end Incentive Compatibility (IC) regret given black-box access to an auction mechanism. Our goal is to 1) compute an estimate for IC regret in an auction, 2) provide a measure of certainty around the estimate of IC regret, and 3) minimize the time it takes to arrive at an accurate estimate. We consider two main problems, with different informational assumptions: In the advertiser problem the goal is to measure IC regret for some known valuation v, while in the more general demand-side platform (DSP) problem we wish to determine the worst-case IC regret over all possible valuations. The problems are naturally phrased in an online learning model and we design algorithms for both problems. We give an online learning algorithm where for the advertiser problem the error of determining IC shrinks as (where B is the finite set of bids, T is the number of time steps, and n is number of auctions per time step), and for the DSP problem it shrinks as . For the DSP problem, we also consider stronger IC regret estimation and extend our algorithm to achieve better IC regret error. We validate the theoretical results using simulations with Generalized Second Price (GSP) auctions, which are known to not be incentive compatible and thus have strictly positive IC regret."
TableNet: An Approach for Determining Fine-grained Relations for Wikipedia Tables,"We focus on the problem of interlinking Wikipedia tables with fine-grained table relations: equivalent and subPartOf. Such relations allow us to harness semantically related information by accessing related tables or facts therein. Determining the type of a relation is not trivial. Relations are dependent on the schemas, the cell-values, and the semantic overlap of the cell values in tables."
Learning Graph Pooling and Hybrid Convolutional Operations for Text Representations,"With the development of graph convolutional networks (GCN), deep learning methods have started to be used on graph data. In additional to convolutional layers, pooling layers are another important components of deep learning. However, no effective pooling methods have been developed for graphs currently. In this work, we propose the graph pooling (gPool) layer, which employs a trainable projection vector to measure the importance of nodes in graphs. By selecting the k-most important nodes to form the new graph, gPool achieves the same objective as regular max pooling layers operation on images and texts. Another limitation of GCN when used on graph-based text representation tasks is that, GCNs do not consider the order information of nodes in graph. To address this limitation, we propose the hybrid convolutional (hConv) layer that combines GCN and regular convolutional operations. The hConv layer is capable of increasing receptive fields quickly and computing features automatically. Based on the proposed gPool and hConv layers, we develop new deep networks for text categorization tasks. Our experimental results show that the networks based on gPool and hConv layers achieves new state-of-the-art performance as compared to baseline methods."
Predicting Human Mobility via Variational Attention,"An important task in Location based Social Network applications is to predict mobility - specifically, user's next point-of-interest (POI) - challenging due to the implicit feedback of footprints, sparsity of generated check-ins, and the joint impact of historical periodicity and recent check-ins. Motivated by recent success of deep variational inference, we propose VANext (Variational Attention based Next) POI prediction: a latent variable model for inferring user's next footprint, with historical mobility attention. The variational encoding captures latent features of recent mobility, followed by searching the similar historical trajectories for periodical patterns. A trajectory convolutional network is then used to learn historical mobility, significantly improving the efficiency over often used recurrent networks. A novel variational attention mechanism is proposed to exploit the periodicity of historical mobility patterns, combined with recent check-in preference to predict next POIs. We also implement a semi-supervised variant - VANext-S, which relies on variational encoding for pre-training all current trajectories in an unsupervised manner, and uses the latent variables to initialize the current trajectory learning. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that VANext and VANext-S outperform the state-of-the-art human mobility prediction models."
Maximizing Marginal Utility per Dollar for Economic Recommendation,"Understanding the economic nature of consumer decisions in e-Commerce is important to personalized recommendation systems. Established economic theories claim that informed consumers always attempt to maximize their utility by choosing the items of the largest marginal utility per dollar (MUD) within their budgets. For example, gaining 5 dollars of extra benefit by spending 10 dollars makes a consumer much more satisfied than having the same amount of extra benefit by spending 20 dollars, although the second product may have higher absolute utility value. Meanwhile, making purchases online may be risky decisions that could cause dissatisfaction. For example, people may give low ratings towards purchased items that they thought they would like when placing the order. Therefore, the design of recommender systems should also take users' risk attitudes into consideration to better learn consumer behaviors."
The few-get-richer: a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings?,"Ranking algorithms play a crucial role in online platforms ranging from search engines to recommender systems. In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications to understand the spread of misinformation."
Context-Sensitive Malicious Spelling Error Correction,"Misspelled words of the malicious kind work by changing specific keywords and are intended to thwart existing automated applications for cyber-environment control such as harassing content detection on the Internet and email spam detection. In this paper, we focus on malicious spelling correction, which requires an approach that relies on the context and the surface forms of targeted keywords. In the context of two applications-profanity detection and email spam detection-we show that malicious misspellings seriously degrade their performance. We then propose a context-sensitive approach for malicious spelling correction using word embeddings and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art spell checkers."
With a Little Help from My Friends (and Their Friends): Influence Neighborhoods for Social Recommendations,"Social recommendations have been a very intriguing domain for researchers in the past decade. The main premise is that the social network of a user can be leveraged to enhance the rating-based recommendation process. This has been achieved in various ways, and under different assumptions about the network characteristics, structure, and availability of other information (such as trust, content, etc.) In this work, we create neighborhoods of influence leveraging only the social graph structure. These are in turn introduced in the recommendation process both as a pre-processing step and as a social regularization factor of the matrix factorization algorithm. Our experimental evaluation using real-life datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique."
Personalized Online Spell Correction for Personal Search,Spell correction is a must-have feature for any modern search engine in applications such as web or e-commerce search. Typical spell correction solutions used in production systems consist of large indexed lookup tables based on a global model trained across many users over a large scale web corpus or a query log.
Inferring Search Queries from Web Documents via a Graph-Augmented Sequence to Attention Network,"We study the problem of search query inference from web documents, where a short, comprehensive natural language query is inferred from a long article. Search query generation or inference is of great value to search engines and recommenders in terms of locating potential target users and ranking content. Despite being closely related to other NLP tasks like abstract generation and keyword extraction, we point out that search query inference is, in fact, a new problem, in that the generated natural language query, which consists of a few words, is expected to be comprehensive enough to lead to the click-through of the corresponding document. Therefore, query generation requires an accurate inference of query words, as well as a deeper level of understanding on document semantic structures. Toward this end, we propose a novel generative model called the Graph-augmented Sequence to Attention (G-S2A) network. Adopting an Encoder-Decoder architecture, G-S2A incorporates a sentence-level Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), a keyword-level GCN, as well as a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) into the encoder to generate structural document representations. An attentional Transformer decoder is then applied to combine different types of encoded features to generate a target query. On a query-document dataset from a real-world search engine, our model outperforms several neural generative models on a wide range of metrics."
Learning Novelty-Aware Ranking of Answers to Complex Questions,"Result ranking diversification has become an important issue for web search, summarization, and question answering. For more complex questions with multiple aspects, such as those in community-based question answering (CQA) sites, a retrieval system should provide a diversified set of relevant results, addressing the different aspects of the query, while minimizing redundancy or repetition. We present a new method, DRN , which learns novelty-related features from unlabeled data with minimal social signals, to emphasize diversity in ranking. Specifically, DRN parameterizes question-answer interactions via an LSTM representation, coupled with an extension of neural tensor network, which in turn is combined with a novelty-driven sampling approach to automatically generate training data. DRN provides a novel and general approach to complex question answering diversification and suggests promising directions for search improvements."
Spatio-Temporal Capsule-based Reinforcement Learning for Mobility-on-Demand Network Coordination,"As an alternative means of convenient and smart transportation, mobility-on-demand (MOD), typified by online ride-sharing and connected taxicabs, has been rapidly growing and spreading worldwide. The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers."
An Investigation of Cyber Autonomy on Government Websites,"From a national security viewpoint, a higher degree of cyber autonomy is crucial to reduce the reliance on external, oftentimes untrustworthy entities, in order to achieve better resilience against adversaries. To probe into the concept of government cyber autonomy, this study examines the external dependency of public-facing government websites across the world's major industrialized, Group of Seven (G7) countries. Over a two-year period, we measured HTTPS adoption rates, the autonomy status of CAs, and the autonomy status of CPs on G7 government websites. We find that approximately 85% of web resources loaded by G7 government sites originate from the United States. By reviewing policy documents and surveying technicians who maintain government websites, we identify four significant forces that can influence the degree of a government's autonomy, including government mandates on HTTPS adoption, website development outsourcing, the citizens' fear of large-scale surveillance, and user confusion. Because a government websites are considered critical information infrastructures, we expect this study to raise awareness of their complex dependency, thereby reducing the risk of blindly trusting external entities when using critical government services."
Transfer Meets Hybrid: A Synthetic Approach for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering with Text,"Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the key technique for recommender systems. CF exploits user-item behavior interactions (e.g., clicks) only and hence suffers from the data sparsity issue. One research thread is to integrate auxiliary information such as product reviews and news titles, leading to hybrid filtering methods. Another thread is to transfer knowledge from source domains such as improving the movie recommendation with the knowledge from the book domain, leading to transfer learning methods. In real-world applications, a user registers for multiple services across websites. Thus it motivates us to exploit both auxiliary and source information for recommendation in this paper. To achieve this, we propose a Transfer Meeting Hybrid (TMH) model for cross-domain recommendation with unstructured text. The proposed TMH model attentively extracts useful content from unstructured text via a memory network and selectively transfers knowledge from a source domain via a transfer network. On two real-world datasets, TMH shows better performance in terms of three ranking metrics by comparing with various baselines. We conduct thorough analyses to understand how the text content and transferred knowledge help the proposed model."

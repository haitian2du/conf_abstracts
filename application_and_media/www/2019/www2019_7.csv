Understanding the Evolution of Mobile App Ecosystems: A Longitudinal Measurement Study of Google Play,"The continuing expansion of mobile app ecosystems has attracted lots of efforts from the research community. However, although a large number of research studies have focused on analyzing the corpus of mobile apps and app markets, little is known at a comprehensive level on the evolution of mobile app ecosystems. Because the mobile app ecosystem is continuously evolving over time, understanding the dynamics of app ecosystems could provide unique insights that cannot be achieved through studying a single static snapshot. In this paper, we seek to shed light on the dynamics of mobile app ecosystems. Based on 5.3 million app records (with both app metadata and apks) collected from three snapshots of Google Play over more than three years, we conduct the first study on the evolution of app ecosystems from different aspects. Our results suggest that although the overall ecosystem shows promising progress in regard of app popularity, user ratings, permission usage and privacy policy declaration, there still exists a considerable number of unsolved issues including malicious apps, update issues, third-party tracking threats, improper app promotion behaviors, and spamming/malicious developers. Our study shows that understanding the evolution of mobile app ecosystems can help developers make better decision on developing and releasing apps, provide insights for app markets to identifying misbehaviors, and help mobile users to choose desired apps."
Multi-Task Feature Learning for Knowledge Graph Enhanced Recommendation,"Collaborative filtering often suffers from sparsity and cold start problems in real recommendation scenarios, therefore, researchers and engineers usually use side information to address the issues and improve the performance of recommender systems. In this paper, we consider knowledge graphs as the source of side information. We propose MKR, a Multi-task feature learning approach for Knowledge graph enhanced Recommendation. MKR is a deep end-to-end framework that utilizes knowledge graph embedding task to assist recommendation task. The two tasks are associated by crosscompress units, which automatically share latent features and learn high-order interactions between items in recommender systems and entities in the knowledge graph. We prove that crosscompress units have sufficient capability of polynomial approximation, and show that MKR is a generalized framework over several representative methods of recommender systems and multi-task learning. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MKR achieves substantial gains in movie, book, music, and news recommendation, over state-of-the-art baselines. MKR is also shown to be able to maintain satisfactory performance even if user-item interactions are sparse."
Towards Efficient Sharing: A Usage Balancing Mechanism for Bike Sharing Systems,"With the rapid development of sharing economy, massive sharing systems such as Uber, Airbnb, and bikeshare have percolated into people's daily life. The sharing economy, at its core, is to achieve efficient use of resources. The actual usage of shared resources, however, is unclear to us. Little measurement or analysis, if any, has been conducted to investigate the resource usage status with the large-scale data collected from these sharing systems. In this paper, we analyze the bike usage status in three typical bikeshare systems based on 140-month multi-event data. Our analysis shows that the most used 20% of bikes account for 45% of usage, while the least used 20% of bikes account for less than 1% of usage. To efficiently utilize shared bikes, we propose a usage balancing design called eShare which has three components: (i) a statistical model based on archived data to infer historical usage; (ii) an entropy-based prediction model based on both real-time and archived data to infer future usage; (iii) a model-driven optimal calibration engine for bike selection to dynamically balance usage. We develop an ID swapping based evaluation methodology and measure the efficiency of eShare with data from three systems including the world's largest bikeshare system with 84,000 bikes and 3,300 stations. Our results show that eShare not only fully utilizes shared bikes but also improves service quality."
Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network,"Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis."
Aspect-level Sentiment Analysis using AS-Capsules,"Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to provide complete and detailed view of sentiment analysis from different aspects. Existing solutions usually adopt a two-staged approach: first detecting aspect category in a document, then categorizing the polarity of opinion expressions for detected aspect(s). Inevitably, such methods lead to error accumulation. Moreover, aspect detection and aspect-level sentiment classification are highly correlated with each other. The key issue here is how to perform aspect detection and aspect-level sentiment classification jointly, and effectively. In this paper, we propose the aspect-level sentiment capsules model (AS-Capsules), which is capable of performing aspect detection and sentiment classification simultaneously, in a joint manner. AS-Capsules utilizes the correlation between aspect and sentiment through shared components including capsule embedding, shared encoders, and shared attentions. AS-Capsules is also capable of communicating with different capsules through a shared Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). More importantly, AS-Capsules model does not require any linguistic knowledge as additional input. Instead, through the attention mechanism, this model is able to attend aspect related words and sentiment words corresponding to different aspect(s). Experiments show that the AS-Capsules model achieves state-of-the-art performances on a benchmark dataset for aspect-level sentiment analysis."
Quality-Sensitive Training! Social Advertisement Generation by Leveraging User Click Behavior,"Social advertisement has emerged as a viable means to improve purchase sharing in the context of e-commerce. However, humanly generating lots of advertising scripts can be prohibitive to both e-platforms and online sellers, and moreover, developing the desired auto-generator will need substantial gold-standard training samples. In this paper, we put forward a novel seq2seq model to generate social advertisements automatically, in which a quality-sensitive loss function is proposed based on user click behavior to differentiate training samples of varied qualities. Our motivation is to leverage the clickthrough data as a kind of quality indicator to measure the textual fitness of each training sample quantitatively, and only those ground truths that satisfy social media users will be considered the eligible and able to optimize the social advertisement generation. Specifically, under the qualified case, the ground truth should be utilized to supervise the whole training phase as much as possible, whereas in the opposite situation, the generated result ought to preserve the semantics of original input to the greatest extent. Simulation experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant superiority over two existing methods of distant supervision and three state-of-the-art NLG solutions."
Demographic Inference and Representative Population Estimates from Multilingual Social Media Data,"Social media provide access to behavioural data at an unprecedented scale and granularity. However, using these data to understand phenomena in a broader population is difficult due to their non-representativeness and the bias of statistical inference tools towards dominant languages and groups. While demographic attribute inference could be used to mitigate such bias, current techniques are almost entirely monolingual and fail to work in a global environment. We address these challenges by combining multilingual demographic inference with post-stratification to create a more representative population sample. To learn demographic attributes, we create a new multimodal deep neural architecture for joint classification of age, gender, and organization-status of social media users that operates in 32 languages. This method substantially outperforms current state of the art while also reducing algorithmic bias. To correct for sampling biases, we propose fully interpretable multilevel regression methods that estimate inclusion probabilities from inferred joint population counts and ground-truth population counts."
Iterative Discriminant Tensor Factorization for Behavior Comparison in Massive Open Online Courses,"The increasing utilization of massive open online courses has significantly expanded global access to formal education. Despite the technology's promising future, student interaction on MOOCs is still a relatively under-explored and poorly understood topic. This work proposes a multi-level pattern discovery through hierarchical discriminative tensor factorization. We formulate the problem as a hierarchical discriminant subspace learning problem, where the goal is to discover the shared and discriminative patterns with a hierarchical structure. The discovered patterns enable a more effective exploration of the contrasting behaviors of two performance groups. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world MOOC datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our study advances the current predictive modeling in MOOCs by providing more interpretable behavioral patterns and linking their relationships with the performance outcome."
Dynamic Ensemble of Contextual Bandits to Satisfy Users' Changing Interests,"Recommender systems have to handle a highly non-stationary environment, due to users' fast changing interests over time. Traditional solutions have to periodically rebuild their models, despite high computational cost. But this still cannot empower them to automatically adjust to abrupt changes in trends caused by timely information. It is important to note that the changes of reward distributions caused by a non-stationary environment can also be context dependent. When the change is orthogonal to the given context, previously maintained models should be reused for better recommendation prediction."
Dual Graph Attention Networks for Deep Latent Representation of Multifaceted Social Effects in Recommender Systems,"Social recommendation leverages social information to solve data sparsity and cold-start problems in traditional collaborative filtering methods. However, most existing models assume that social effects from friend users are static and under the forms of constant weights or fixed constraints. To relax this strong assumption, in this paper, we propose dual graph attention networks to collaboratively learn representations for two-fold social effects, where one is modeled by a user-specific attention weight and the other is modeled by a dynamic and context-aware attention weight. We also extend the social effects in user domain to item domain, so that information from related items can be leveraged to further alleviate the data sparsity problem. Furthermore, considering that different social effects in two domains could interact with each other and jointly influence users' preferences for items, we propose a new policy-based fusion strategy based on contextual multi-armed bandit to weigh interactions of various social effects. Experiments on one benchmark dataset and a commercial dataset verify the efficacy of the key components in our model. The results show that our model achieves great improvement for recommendation accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art social recommendation methods."
Grid-based Evaluation Metrics for Web Image Search,"Compared to general web search engines, web image search engines display results in a different way. In web image search, results are typically placed in a grid-based manner rather than a sequential result list. In this scenario, users can view results not only in a vertical direction but also in a horizontal direction. Moreover, pagination is usually not (explicitly) supported on image search search engine result pages (SERPs), and users can view results by scrolling down without having to click a “next page” button. These differences lead to different interaction mechanisms and user behavior patterns, which, in turn, create challenges to evaluation metrics that have originally been developed for general web search. While considerable effort has been invested in developing evaluation metrics for general web search, there has been relatively little effort to construct grid-based evaluation metrics."
Sarcasm Detection with Self-matching Networks and Low-rank Bilinear Pooling,"Sarcasm is sophisticated linguistic expression and is commonly observed on social media and e-commerce platforms. Failure to detect sarcastic expressions in natural language processing tasks, such as opinion mining and sentiment analysis, leads to poor model performance. Traditional approaches rely heavily on discrete handcrafted features and will incur enormous human costs. It was not until recent that scholars began to employ neural networks to address these limitations and have achieved new state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we propose a novel self-matching network to capture sentence ”incongruity” information by exploring word-to-word interactions. In particular, we calculate the joint information in each word-to-word pair in the input sentence to build a self-matching attention vector, based on which we attend the sentence and build its representation vector. Such a network allows sentence to match within itself word by word and cater to the words of conflict sentiments. In addition, we incorporate a bi-directional LSTM network into our proposed network to retain compositional information. We concatenate incongruity information and compositional information through a Low-rank Bilinear Pooling method to control for potential information redundancy without losing discriminative power. Experiment results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms extant baselines on standard evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy."
A First Look at Deep Learning Apps on Smartphones,"To bridge the knowledge gap between research and practice, we present the first empirical study on 16,500 the most popular Android apps, demystifying how smartphone apps exploit deep learning in the wild. To this end, we build a new static tool that dissects apps and analyzes their deep learning functions. Our study answers threefold questions: what are the early adopter apps of deep learning, what do they use deep learning for, and how do their deep learning models look like. Our study has strong implications for app developers, smartphone vendors, and deep learning R&D. On one hand, our findings paint a promising picture of deep learning for smartphones, showing the prosperity of mobile deep learning frameworks as well as the prosperity of apps building their cores atop deep learning. On the other hand, our findings urge optimizations on deep learning models deployed on smartphones, protection of these models, and validation of research ideas on these models."
Constrained Local Graph Clustering by Colored Random Walk,"Detecting local graph clusters is an important problem in big graph analysis. Given seed nodes in a graph, local clustering aims at finding subgraphs around the seed nodes, which consist of nodes highly relevant to the seed nodes. However, existing local clustering methods either allow only a single seed node, or assume all seed nodes are from the same cluster, which is not true in many real applications. Moreover, the assumption that all seed nodes are in a single cluster fails to use the crucial information of relations between seed nodes. In this paper, we propose a method to take advantage of such relationship. With prior knowledge of the community membership of the seed nodes, the method labels seed nodes in the same (different) community by the same (different) color. To further use this information, we introduce a color-based random walk mechanism, where colors are propagated from the seed nodes to every node in the graph. By the interaction of identical and distinct colors, we can enclose the supervision of seed nodes into the random walk process. We also propose a heuristic strategy to speed up the algorithm by more than 2 orders of magnitude. Experimental evaluations reveal that our clustering method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin."
Revisiting User Mobility and Social Relationships in LBSNs: A Hypergraph Embedding Approach,"Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have been widely used as a primary data source to study the impact of mobility and social relationships on each other. Traditional approaches manually define features to characterize users' mobility homophily and social proximity, and show that mobility and social features can help friendship and location prediction tasks, respectively. However, these hand-crafted features not only require tedious human efforts, but also are difficult to generalize. In this paper, by revisiting user mobility and social relationships based on a large-scale LBSN dataset collected over a long-term period, we propose LBSN2Vec, a hypergraph embedding approach designed specifically for LBSN data for automatic feature learning. Specifically, LBSN data intrinsically forms a hypergraph including both user-user edges (friendships) and user-time-POI-semantic hyperedges (check-ins). Based on this hypergraph, we first propose a random-walk-with-stay scheme to jointly sample user check-ins and social relationships, and then learn node embeddings from the sampled (hyper)edges by preserving n-wise node proximity (n = 2 or 4). Our evaluation results show that LBSN2Vec both consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on both friendship and location prediction tasks, with an average improvement of 32.95% and 25.32%, respectively. Moreover, using LBSN2Vec, we discover the asymmetric impact of mobility and social relationships on predicting each other, which can serve as guidelines for future research on friendship and location prediction in LBSNs."
Scalpel-CD: Leveraging Crowdsourcing and Deep Probabilistic Modeling for Debugging Noisy Training Data,"This paper presents Scalpel-CD, a first-of-its-kind system that leverages both human and machine intelligence to debug noisy labels from the training data of machine learning systems. Our system identifies potentially wrong labels using a deep probabilistic model, which is able to infer the latent class of a high-dimensional data instance by exploiting data distributions in the underlying latent feature space. To minimize crowd efforts, it employs a data sampler which selects data instances that would benefit the most from being inspected by the crowd. The manually verified labels are then propagated to similar data instances in the original training data by exploiting the underlying data structure, thus scaling out the contribution from the crowd. Scalpel-CD is designed with a set of algorithmic solutions to automatically search for the optimal configurations for different types of training data, in terms of the underlying data structure, noise ratio, and noise types (random vs. structural). In a real deployment on multiple machine learning tasks, we demonstrate that Scalpel-CD is able to improve label quality by 12.9% with only 2.8% instances inspected by the crowd."
How Intention Informed Recommendations Modulate Choices: A Field Study of Spoken Word Content,"People's content choices are ideally driven by their intentions, aspirations, and plans. However, in reality, choices may be modulated by recommendation systems which are typically trained to promote popular items and to reinforce users' historical behavior. As a result, the utility and user experience of content consumption can be affected implicitly and undesirably. To study this problem, we conducted a 2 × 2 randomized controlled field experiment (105 urban college students) to compare the effects of intention informed recommendations with classical intention agnostic systems. The study was conducted in the context of spoken word web content (podcasts) which is often consumed through subscription sites or apps. We modified a commercial podcast app to include (1) a recommender that takes into account users' stated intentions at onboarding, and (2) a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender during daily use. Our study suggests that: (1) intention-aware recommendations can significantly raise users' interactions (subscriptions and listening) with channels and episodes related to intended topics by over 24%, even if such a recommender is only used during onboarding, and (2) the CF-based recommender doubles users' explorations on episodes from not-subscribed channels and improves satisfaction for users onboarded with the intention-aware recommender."
Learning from Multiple Cities: A Meta-Learning Approach for Spatial-Temporal Prediction,"Spatial-temporal prediction is a fundamental problem for constructing smart city, which is useful for tasks such as traffic control, taxi dispatching, and environment policy making. Due to data collection mechanism, it is common to see data collection with unbalanced spatial distributions. For example, some cities may release taxi data for multiple years while others only release a few days of data; some regions may have constant water quality data monitored by sensors whereas some regions only have a small collection of water samples. In this paper, we tackle the problem of spatial-temporal prediction for the cities with only a short period of data collection. We aim to utilize the long-period data from other cities via transfer learning. Different from previous studies that transfer knowledge from one single source city to a target city, we are the first to leverage information from multiple cities to increase the stability of transfer. Specifically, our proposed model is designed as a spatial-temporal network with a meta-learning paradigm. The meta-learning paradigm learns a well-generalized initialization of the spatial-temporal network, which can be effectively adapted to target cities. In addition, a pattern-based spatial-temporal memory is designed to distill long-term temporal information (i.e., periodicity). We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks: traffic (taxi and bike) prediction and water quality prediction. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model over several competitive baseline models."
STFNets: Learning Sensing Signals from the Time-Frequency Perspective with Short-Time Fourier Neural Networks,"Recent advances in deep learning motivate the use of deep neural networks in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. These networks are modelled after signal processing in the human brain, thereby leading to significant advantages at perceptual tasks such as vision and speech recognition. IoT applications, however, often measure physical phenomena, where the underlying physics (such as inertia, wireless signal propagation, or the natural frequency of oscillation) are fundamentally a function of signal frequencies, offering better features in the frequency domain. This observation leads to a fundamental question: For IoT applications, can one develop a new brand of neural network structures that synthesize features inspired not only by the biology of human perception but also by the fundamental nature of physics? Hence, in this paper, instead of using conventional building blocks (e.g., convolutional and recurrent layers), we propose a new foundational neural network building block, the Short-Time Fourier Neural Network (STFNet). It integrates a widely-used time-frequency analysis method, the Short-Time Fourier Transform, into data processing to learn features directly in the frequency domain, where the physics of underlying phenomena leave better footprints. STFNets bring additional flexibility to time-frequency analysis by offering novel nonlinear learnable operations that are spectral-compatible. Moreover, STFNets show that transforming signals to a domain that is more connected to the underlying physics greatly simplifies the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STFNets with extensive experiments on a wide range of sensing inputs, including motion sensors, WiFi, ultrasound, and visible light. STFNets significantly outperform the state-of-the-art deep learning models in all experiments. A STFNet, therefore, demonstrates superior capability as the fundamental building block of deep neural networks for IoT applications for various sensor inputs 1."
CoaCor: Code Annotation for Code Retrieval with Reinforcement Learning,"To accelerate software development, much research has been performed to help people understand and reuse the huge amount of available code resources. Two important tasks have been widely studied: code retrieval, which aims to retrieve code snippets relevant to a given natural language query from a code base, and code annotation, where the goal is to annotate a code snippet with a natural language description. Despite their advancement in recent years, the two tasks are mostly explored separately. In this work, we investigate a novel perspective of Code annotation for Code retrieval (hence called “CoaCor”), where a code annotation model is trained to generate a natural language annotation that can represent the semantic meaning of a given code snippet and can be leveraged by a code retrieval model to better distinguish relevant code snippets from others. To this end, we propose an effective framework based on reinforcement learning, which explicitly encourages the code annotation model to generate annotations that can be used for the retrieval task. Through extensive experiments, we show that code annotations generated by our framework are much more detailed and more useful for code retrieval, and they can further improve the performance of existing code retrieval models significantly.1"
Snapshot-based Loading Acceleration of Web Apps with Nondeterministic JavaScript Execution,"JavaScript execution is heavily used during the loading of web apps, taking a substantial portion of the app loading time. To accelerate JavaScript execution, snapshot-based app loading has been proposed [5, 17]. We take a snapshot of the JavaScript objects in the heap at some point during app loading (which we call snapshot point) and save them in a file in advance. Then, we start app loading by copying the objects in the snapshot to the heap directly, skipping JavaScript execution to create those objects. One issue is that the JavaScript execution state at the snapshot point should be the same at every app loading. If JavaScript execution included in the snapshot is involved with some nondeterminism (e.g., use random function or current time/location), snapshot-based app loading might be inapplicable since the loaded state might differ each time."
Doppelgängers on the Dark Web: A Large-scale Assessment on Phishing Hidden Web Services,"Anonymous network services on the World Wide Web have emerged as a new web architecture, called the Dark Web. The Dark Web has been notorious for harboring cybercriminals abusing anonymity. At the same time, the Dark Web has been a last resort for people who seek freedom of the press as well as avoid censorship. This anonymous nature allows website operators to conceal their identity and thereby leads users to have difficulties in determining the authenticity of websites. Phishers abuse this perplexing authenticity to lure victims; however, only a little is known about the prevalence of phishing attacks on the Dark Web."
Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks for Dynamic Recommender Systems,"Recommender systems that can learn from cross-session data to dynamically predict the next item a user will choose are crucial for online platforms. However, existing approaches often use out-of-the-box sequence models which are limited by speed and memory consumption, are often infeasible for production environments, and usually do not incorporate cross-session information, which is crucial for effective recommendations. Here we propose Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks (HierTCN), a hierarchical deep learning architecture that makes dynamic recommendations based on users' sequential multi-session interactions with items. HierTCN is designed for web-scale systems with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users. It consists of two levels of models: The high-level model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to aggregate users' evolving long-term interests across different sessions, while the low-level model is implemented with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), utilizing both the long-term interests and the short-term interactions within sessions to predict the next interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on a public XING dataset and a large-scale Pinterest dataset that contains 6 million users with 1.6 billion interactions. We show that HierTCN is 2.5x faster than RNN-based models and uses 90% less data memory compared to TCN-based models. We further develop an effective data caching scheme and a queue-based mini-batch generator, enabling our model to be trained within 24 hours on a single GPU. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic recommendation methods, with up to 18% improvement in recall and 10% in mean reciprocal rank."
Spectrum-enhanced Pairwise Learning to Rank,"To enhance the performance of the recommender system, side information is extensively explored with various features (e.g., visual features and textual features). However, there are some demerits of side information: (1) the extra data is not always available in all recommendation tasks; (2) it is only for items, there is seldom high-level feature describing users. To address these gaps, we introduce the spectral features extracted from two hypergraph structures of the purchase records. Spectral features describe the similarity of users/items in the graph space, which is critical for recommendation. We leverage spectral features to model the users' preference and items' properties by incorporating them into a Matrix Factorization (MF) model."
Beyond Shortest Paths: Route Recommendations for Ride-sharing,"In taxi ride-sharing, multiple customers are allotted to the same taxi as long as they are compatible, i.e., if none of them suffers a detour beyond a permissible threshold. To attract customers to ride-sharing, taxi operators promise a reduced fare upfront. As a result, if the taxi fails to pair the initial customer with additional compatible passengers, the taxi operator incurs a financial loss. Hence, it is important to ensure that the taxi finds compatible customers once it has picked up the initial customer. In the current scenario, the appearance of subsequent compatible customers is left to luck: a taxi moves along the shortest (or quickest) path for the existing customer and hopes to find additional compatible customers on its way. In this paper, we ask: Is the shortest path the optimal path for ride-sharing? To investigate this question, we develop a route recommendation algorithm called Share, which predicts the route with the highest probability of finding compatible customers, while staying within the detour limits. Through extensive evaluations on real datasets, we show that Share reduces failure rate in ride-sharing by up to 40%, while also improving waiting time for customers by 20%. Technically, the route recommendation problem is NP-hard. We overcome this bottleneck, by reducing the search space of the entire road network into a smaller directed acyclic graph, on which we perform dynamic programming to identify the optimal route. This strategy allows us to answer queries within 0.2 seconds, and thereby making Share deployable on real road conditions."
Detecting Low Self-Esteem in Youths from Web Search Data,"Online behavior leaves a digital footprint that can be analyzed to reveal our cognitive and psychological state through time. Recognizing these subtle cues can help identify different aspects of mental health, such as low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Google's web search engine, used daily by millions of people, logs every search query made by a user, which is accessible through a platform called Google Takeout. Previous researchers have made efforts to detect and predict behaviors associated with depression and anxiety from web data, but only at a population level. This paper fills in the gap of looking into signs of low self-esteem, a condition that work in a vicious cycle with depression and anxiety, at an individual level by looking into Google search history data. We target college students, a population prone to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, and ask to take mental health assessment survey along with their individual search history. Textual analysis show that search logs contain strong signals that can identify individuals with current low self-esteem. For example, participants with low self-esteem have fewer searches pertaining to family, friend, and money attributes; and we also observed differences in the search category distribution, over time, when compared with individuals with moderate to high self-esteem. Using these markers we were able to build a probabilistic classifier that can identify low self-esteem conditions, based on search history, with an average F1 score of 0.86."
The Matthew Effect in Computation Contests: High Difficulty May Lead to 51% Dominance?,"We study the computation contests where players compete for searching a solution to a given problem with a winner-take-all reward. The search processes are independent across the players and the search speeds of players are proportional to their computational powers. One concrete application of this abstract model is the mining process of proof-of-work type blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin. Although one's winning probability is believed to be proportional to his computational power in previous studies on Bitcoin, we show that it is not the case in the strict sense."
Judging a Book by Its Cover: The Effect of Facial Perception on Centrality in Social Networks,"Facial appearance matters in social networks. Individuals frequently make trait judgments from facial clues. Although these face-based impressions lack the evidence to determine validity, they are of vital importance, because they may relate to human network-based social behavior, such as seeking certain individuals for help, advice, dating, and cooperation, and thus they may relate to centrality in social networks. However, little to no work has investigated the apparent facial traits that influence network centrality, despite the large amount of research on attributions of the central position including personality and behavior. In this paper, we examine whether perceived traits based on facial appearance affect network centrality by exploring the initial stage of social network formation in a first-year college residential area. We took face photos of participants who are freshmen living in the same residential area, and we asked them to nominate community members linking to different networks. We then collected facial perception data by requiring other participants to rate facial images for three main attributions: dominance, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. Meanwhile, we proposed a framework to discover how facial appearance affects social networks. Our results revealed that perceived facial traits were correlated with the network centrality and that they were indicative to predict the centrality of people in different networks. Our findings provide psychological evidence regarding the interaction between faces and network centrality. Our findings also offer insights in to a combination of psychological and social network techniques, and they highlight the function of facial bias in cuing and signaling social traits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the influence of facial perception on centrality in social networks."
Pruning based Distance Sketches with Provable Guarantees on Random Graphs,"Measuring the distances between vertices on graphs is one of the most fundamental components in network analysis. Since finding shortest paths requires traversing the graph, it is challenging to obtain distance information on large graphs very quickly. In this work, we present a preprocessing algorithm that is able to create landmark based distance sketches efficiently, with strong theoretical guarantees. When evaluated on a diverse set of social and information networks, our algorithm significantly improves over existing approaches by reducing the number of landmarks stored, preprocessing time, or stretch of the estimated distances."
Large-Scale Talent Flow Forecast with Dynamic Latent Factor Model?,"The understanding of talent flow is critical for sharpening company talent strategy to keep competitiveness in the current fast-evolving environment. Existing studies on talent flow analysis generally rely on subjective surveys. However, without large-scale quantitative studies, there are limits to deliver fine-grained predictive business insights for better talent management. To this end, in this paper, we aim to introduce a big data-driven approach for predictive talent flow analysis. Specifically, we first construct a time-aware job transition tensor by mining the large-scale job transition records of digital resumes from online professional networks (OPNs), where each entry refers to a fine-grained talent flow rate of a specific job position between two companies. Then, we design a dynamic latent factor based Evolving Tensor Factorization (ETF) model for predicting the future talent flows. In particular, a novel evolving feature by jointly considering the influence of previous talent flows and global market is introduced for modeling the evolving nature of each company. Furthermore, to improve the predictive performance, we also integrate several representative attributes of companies as side information for regulating the model inference. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on large-scale real-world data for evaluating the model performances. The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of talent flow forecast. Meanwhile, the results also reveal some interesting findings on the regularity of talent flows, e.g. Facebook becomes more and more attractive for the engineers from Google in 2016."

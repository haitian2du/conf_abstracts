Joint User- and Event- Driven Stable Social Event Organization,"The problem of social event organization (SEO) rises with the advent of online web services and plays an important role in helping users discover new offline events. Existing work on SEO only assumes that different users have different preferences towards different events, ignoring the fact that each event (its organizer) may have a separate preference towards every user. In this paper, we investigate joint user- and event- driven SEO by simultaneously considering user preferences (towards events) and event preferences (towards users). A risen challenging problem is that this joint consideration may suffer instabilities between users and events which are NP-hard to handle in SEO. Stability is a desired property that needs to be maintained in SEO, otherwise participants will incline towards changing to other events and trust less the organizer."
Learning on Partial-Order Hypergraphs,"Graph-based learning methods explicitly consider the relations between two entities (i.e., vertices) for learning the prediction function. They have been widely used in semi-supervised learning, manifold ranking, and clustering, among other tasks. Enhancing the expressiveness of simple graphs, hypergraphs formulate an edge as a link to multiple vertices, so as to model the higher-order relations among entities. For example, hyperedges in a hypergraph can be used to encode the similarity among vertices."
"""Satisfaction with Failure"" or ""Unsatisfied Success"": Investigating the Relationship between Search Success and User Satisfaction","User satisfaction has been paid much attention to in recent Web search evaluation studies. Although satisfaction is often considered as an important symbol of search success, it doesn»t guarantee success in many cases, especially for complex search task scenarios. In this study, we investigate the differences between user satisfaction and search success, and try to adopt the findings to predict search success in complex search tasks. To achieve these research goals, we conduct a laboratory study in which search success and user satisfaction are annotated by domain expert assessors and search users, respectively. We find that both ""Satisfaction with Failure"" and ""Unsatisfied Success"" cases happen in these search tasks and together they account for as many as 40.3% of all search sessions. The factors (e.g. document readability and credibility) that lead to the inconsistency of search success and user satisfaction are also investigated and adopted to predict whether one search task is successful. Experimental results show that our proposed prediction method is effective in predicting search success."
TEM: Tree-enhanced Embedding Model for Explainable Recommendation,"While collaborative filtering is the dominant technique in personalized recommendation, it models user-item interactions only and cannot provide concrete reasons for a recommendation. Meanwhile, the rich side information affiliated with user-item interactions (e.g., user demographics and item attributes), which provide valuable evidence that why a recommendation is suitable for a user, has not been fully explored in providing explanations."
Ad Hoc Table Retrieval using Semantic Similarity,"We introduce and address the problem of ad hoc table retrieval: answering a keyword query with a ranked list of tables. This task is not only interesting on its own account, but is also being used as a core component in many other table-based information access scenarios, such as table completion or table mining. The main novel contribution of this work is a method for performing semantic matching between queries and tables. Specifically, we (i) represent queries and tables in multiple semantic spaces (both discrete sparse and continuous dense vector representations) and (ii) introduce various similarity measures for matching those semantic representations. We consider all possible combinations of semantic representations and similarity measures and use these as features in a supervised learning model. Using a purpose-built test collection based on Wikipedia tables, we demonstrate significant and substantial improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline."
Query Suggestion with Feedback Memory Network,"This paper presents Feedback Memory Network (\textttFMN) which models user interactions with the search engine for query suggestion. Besides modeling the queries issued by the user, \textttFMN also considers user feedback on the search results. It converts user browsing and click actions to the attention over the top-ranked documents and combines them into the feedback memories of the query, thus better models the underlying information needs. The feedback memories and the query sequence are then combined to suggest queries by the sequence-to-sequence neural network. Modeling user feedback makes it possible to suggest diverse queries for the same query sequence, if users have preferred different search results that indicate different information needs. Our experiments on the search log from a Chinese commercial search engine showed the stable and robust advantages of \textttFMN. Especially when the feedback is richer or more informative, \textttFMN provides more diverse and accurate suggestions, which is exceptionally helpful for ambiguous sessions where more information is required to infer the search intents."
A Sparse Topic Model for Extracting Aspect-Specific Summaries from Online Reviews,"Online reviews have become an inevitable part of a consumer's decision making process, where the likelihood of purchase not only depends on the product's overall rating, but also on the description of its aspects. Therefore, e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Walmart constantly encourage users to write good quality re- views and categorically summarize different facets of the products. However, despite such attempts, it takes a significant effort to skim through thousands of reviews and look for answers that address the query of consumers. For example, a gamer might be interested in buying a monitor with fast refresh rates and support for Gsync and Freesync technologies, while a photographer might be interested in aspects such as color depth and accuracy. To address these chal- lenges, in this paper, we propose a generative aspect summarization model called APSUM that is capable of providing fine-grained sum- maries of online reviews. To overcome the inherent problem of aspect sparsity, we impose dual constraints: (a) a spike-and-slab prior over the document-topic distribution and (b) a linguistic su- pervision over the word-topic distribution. Using a rigorous set of experiments, we show that the proposed model is capable of out- performing the state-of-the-art aspect summarization model over a variety of datasets and deliver intuitive fine-grained summaries that could simplify the purchase decisions of consumers."
Neural Attentional Rating Regression with Review-level Explanations,"Reviews information is dominant for users to make online purchasing decisions in e-commerces. However, the usefulness of reviews is varied. We argue that less-useful reviews hurt model's performance, and are also less meaningful for user's reference. While some existing models utilize reviews for improving the performance of recommender systems, few of them consider the usefulness of reviews for recommendation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to explore the usefulness of reviews, and propose a Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations (NARRE) for recommendation. Specifically, NARRE can not only predict precise ratings, but also learn the usefulness of each review simultaneously. Therefore, the highly-useful reviews are obtained which provide review-level explanations to help users make better and faster decisions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of Amazon and Yelp on different domains show that the proposed NARRE model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches, including PMF, NMF, SVD++, HFT, and DeepCoNN in terms of rating prediction, by the proposed attention model that takes review usefulness into consideration. Furthermore, the selected reviews are shown to be effective when taking existing review-usefulness ratings in the system as ground truth. Besides, crowd-sourcing based evaluations reveal that in most cases, NARRE achieves equal or even better performances than system's usefulness rating method in selecting reviews. And it is flexible to offer great help on the dominant cases in real e-commerce scenarios when the ratings on review-usefulness are not available in the system."
Learning from Multi-View Multi-Way Data via Structural Factorization Machines,"Real-world relations among entities can often be observed and determined by different perspectives/views. For example, the decision made by a user on whether to adopt an item relies on multiple aspects such as the contextual information of the decision, the item»s attributes, the user»s profile and the reviews given by other users. Different views may exhibit multi-way interactions among entities and provide complementary information. In this paper, we introduce a multi-tensor-based approach that can preserve the underlying structure of multi-view data in a generic predictive model. Specifically, we propose structural factorization machines (SFMs) that learn the common latent spaces shared by multi-view tensors and automatically adjust the importance of each view in the predictive model. Furthermore, the complexity of SFMs is linear in the number of parameters, which make SFMs suitable to large-scale problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed SFMs outperform several state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational cost."
Scalable Supervised Discrete Hashing for Large-Scale Search,"Supervised hashing methods have attracted much attention in these years. However, most existing supervised hashing algorithms have some of the following problems. First, most of them leverage the pairwise similarity matrix, whose size is quadratic to the number of training samples, to supervise the learning of hash codes. Thus, they are not scalable when dealing with large data. Second, most of them relax the discrete constraints for easy optimization and then quantize the learnt real-valued solution to binary hash codes. Therefore, the quantization error caused by the relaxation may lead to a decline of retrieval performance. To address these issues and make the supervised method scalable to large datasets, we present a novel hashing method, named Scalable Supervised Discrete Hashing (SSDH). Specifically, based on a new loss function, SSDH bypasses the direct optimization on the n by n pairwise similarity matrix. In addition, SSDH adopts no relaxation optimization scheme in the learning procedure and avoids the large quantization error problem. Moreover, during learning, it leverages both the pairwise similarity matrix and label matrix; thus, more semantic information can be embedded to the learning of hash codes. Extensive experiments are conducted on six benchmark datasets including two large-scale datasets, i.e., NUS-WIDE and ImageNet. The results show that SSDH can outperform state-of-the-art baselines on these datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency."
Subgraph-augmented Path Embedding for Semantic User Search on Heterogeneous Social Network,"Semantic user search is an important task on heterogeneous social networks. Its core problem is to measure the proximity between two user objects in the network w.r.t. certain semantic user relation. State-of-the-art solutions often take a path-based approach, which uses the sequences of objects connecting a query user and a target user to measure their proximity. Despite their success, we assert that path as a low-order structure is insufficient to capture the rich semantics between two users. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a new concept of subgraph-augmented path for semantic user search. Specifically, we consider sampling a set of object paths from a query user to a target user; then in each object path, we replace the linear object sequence between its every two neighboring users with their shared subgraph instances. Such subgraph-augmented paths are expected to leverage both path»s distance awareness and subgraph»s high-order structure. As it is non-trivial to model such subgraph-augmented paths, we develop a Subgraph-augmented Path Embedding (SPE) framework to accomplish the task. We evaluate our solution on six semantic user relations in three real-world public data sets, and show that it outperforms the baselines."
Leveraging Fine-Grained Wikipedia Categories for Entity Search,"Ad-hoc entity search, which is to retrieve a ranked list of relevant entities in response to a query of natural language question, has been widely studied. It has been shown that category matching of entities, especially when matching to fine-grained entity types/categories, is critical to the performance of entity search. However, the potentials of the fine-grained Wikipedia entity categories, has not been well exploited by existing studies. Based on the observation of how people describe entities of a specific type, we propose a headword-and-modifier model to deeply interpret both queries and fine-grained entity types/categories. Probabilistic generative models are designed to effectively estimate the relevance of headwords and modifiers as a pattern-based matching problem, taking the Wikipedia type taxonomy as an important input to address the ad-hoc representations of concepts/entities in queries. Extensive experimental results on three widely-used test sets: INEX-XER 2009, SemSearch-LS and TREC-Entity, show that our method achieves a significant improvement of the entity search performance over the state-of-the-art methods."
Online Compact Convexified Factorization Machine,"Factorization Machine (FM) is a supervised learning approach with a powerful capability of feature engineering. It yields state-of-the-art performances in various batch learning tasks where all the training data is made available prior to the training. However, in real-world applications where the data arrives sequentially in a streaming manner, the high cost of re-training with batch learning algorithms has posed formidable challenges in the online learning scenario. The initial challenge is that no prior formulations of FM could directly fulfill the requirements in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) -- the paramount framework for online learning algorithm design. To address this aforementioned challenge, we invent a new convexification scheme leading to a Compact Convexified FM (CCFM) that seamlessly meets the requirements in OCO. However for learning Compact Convexified FM (CCFM) in the online learning settings, most existing algorithms suffer from expensive projection operations. To address this subsequent challenge, we follow the general projection-free algorithmic framework of Online Conditional Gradient and propose an Online Compact Convex Factorization Machine (OCCFM) algorithm that eschews the projection operation with efficient linear optimization steps. In support of the proposed OCCFM in terms of its theoretical foundation, we prove that the developed algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret bound. To evaluate the empirical performance of OCCFM, we conduct extensive experiments on 6 real-world datasets for online regression and online classification tasks. The experimental results show that OCCFM outperforms the state-of-art online learning methods for FM."
Understanding and Predicting Delay in Reciprocal Relations,"Reciprocity in directed networks points to user»s willingness to return favors in building mutual interactions. High reciprocity has been widely observed in many directed social media networks such as following relations in Twitter and Tumblr. Therefore, reciprocal relations between users are often regarded as a basic mechanism to create stable social ties and play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of networks. Each reciprocity relation is formed by two parasocial links in a back-and-forth manner with a time delay. Hence, understanding the delay can help us gain better insights into the underlying mechanisms of network dynamics. Meanwhile, the accurate prediction of delay has practical implications in advancing a variety of real-world applications such as friend recommendation and marketing campaign. For example, by knowing when will users follow back, service providers can focus on the users with a potential long reciprocal delay for effective targeted marketing. This paper presents the initial investigation of the time delay in reciprocal relations. Our study is based on a large-scale directed network from Tumblr that consists of 62.8 million users and 3.1 billion user following relations with a timespan of multiple years (from 31 Oct 2007 to 24 Jul 2013). We reveal a number of interesting patterns about the delay that motivate the development of a principled learning model to predict the delay in reciprocal relations. Experimental results on the above mentioned dynamic networks corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed delay prediction model."
Hierarchical Variational Memory Network for Dialogue Generation,"Dialogue systems help various real applications interact with humans in an intelligent natural way. In dialogue systems, the task of dialogue generation aims to generate utterances given previous utterances as contexts. Among various spectrums of dialogue generation approaches, end-to-end neural generation models have received an increase of attention. These end-to-end neural generation models are capable of generating natural-sounding sentences with a unified neural encoder-decoder network structure. The end-to-end structure sequentially encodes each word in an input context and generates the response word-by-word deterministically during decoding. However, lack of variation and limited ability in capturing long-term dependencies between utterances still challenge existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical variational memory network (HVMN), by adding the hierarchical structure and the variational memory network into a neural encoder-decoder network. By emulating human-to-human dialogues, our proposed method can capture both the high-level abstract variations and long-term memories during dialogue tracking, which enables the random access of relevant dialogue histories. Extensive experiments conducted on three large real-world datasets verify a significant improvement of our proposed model against state-of-the-art baselines for dialogue generation."
Strategies for Geographical Scoping and Improving a Gazetteer,"Many applications that use geographical databases (a.k.a. gazetteers) rely on the accuracy of the information in the database. However, poor data quality is an issue when data is integrated from multiple sources with different quality constraints and sometimes with little information about the sources. One major consequence of this is that the geographical scope of a location and/or its position may not be known or may not be accurate. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting the scope of locations in a geographical database and its applications in identifying inconsistencies and improving the quality of a gazetteer. We develop novel strategies, including probabilistic and geometric approaches, to accurately derive the geographical scope of places based on the spatial hierarchy of a gazetteer as well as other public information (such as area) that may be available. We show how the boundary information derived here can be useful in identifying inconsistencies, enhancing the location hierarchy and improving the applications that rely on gazetteers. Our experimental evaluation on two public-domain gazetteers reveals that the proposed approaches significantly outperform, in terms of the accuracy of the geographical bounding boxes, a baseline that is based on the parent-child relationship of a gazetteer. Among applications, we show that the boundary information derived here can move more than 20% of locations in a public gazetteer to better positions in the hierarchy and that the accuracy of those moves is over 90%."
"Detecting Crowdturfing ""Add to Favorites"" Activities in Online Shopping","""Add to Favorites"" is a popular function in online shopping sites which helps users to make a record of potentially interesting items for future purchases. It is usually regarded as a type of explicit feedback signal for item popularity and therefore also adopted as a ranking signal by many shopping search engines. With the increasing usage of crowdsourcing platforms, some malicious online sellers also organize crowdturfing activities to increase the numbers of ""Add to Favorites"" for their items. By this means, they expect the items to gain higher positions in search ranking lists and therefore boost sales. This kind of newly-appeared malicious activity proposes challenges to traditional search spam detection efforts because it involves the participation of many crowd workers who are normal online shopping users in most of the times, and these activities are composed of a series of behaviors including search, browse, click and add to favorites. To shed light on this research question, we are among the first to investigate this particular spamming activity by looking into both the task organization information in crowdsourcing platforms and the user behavior information from online shopping sites. With a comprehensive analysis of some ground truth spamming activities from the perspective of behavior, user and item, we propose a factor graph based model to identify this kind of spamming activity. Experimental results based on data collected in practical shopping search environment show that our model helps detect malicious ""Add to Favorites"" activities effectively."
Search Process as Transitions Between Neural States,"Search is one of the most performed activities on the World Wide Web. Various conceptual models postulate that the search process can be broken down into distinct emotional and cognitive states of searchers while they engage in a search process. These models significantly contribute to our understanding of the search process. However, they are typically based on self-report measures, such as surveys, questionnaire, etc. and therefore, only indirectly monitor the brain activity that supports such a process. With this work, we take one step further and directly measure the brain activity involved in a search process. To do so, we break down a search process into five time periods: a realisation of Information Need, Query Formulation, Query Submission, Relevance Judgment and Satisfaction Judgment. We then investigate the brain activity between these time periods. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we monitored the brain activity of twenty-four participants during a search process that involved answering questions carefully selected from the TREC-8 and TREC 2001 Q/A Tracks. This novel analysis that focuses on transitions rather than states reveals the contrasting brain activity between time periods - which enables the identification of the distinct parts of the search process as the user moves through them. This work, therefore, provides an important first step in representing the search process based on the transitions between neural states. Discovering more precisely how brain activity relates to different parts of the search process will enable the development of brain-computer interactions that better support search and search interactions, which we believe our study and conclusions advance."
StaQC: A Systematically Mined Question-Code Dataset from Stack Overflow,"Stack Overflow (SO) has been a great source of natural language questions and their code solutions (i.e., question-code pairs), which are critical for many tasks including code retrieval and annotation. In most existing research, question-code pairs were collected heuristically and tend to have low quality. In this paper, we investigate a new problem of systematically mining question-code pairs from Stack Overflow (in contrast to heuristically collecting them). It is formulated as predicting whether or not a code snippet is a standalone solution to a question. We propose a novel Bi-View Hierarchical Neural Network which can capture both the programming content and the textual context of a code snippet (i.e., two views) to make a prediction. On two manually annotated datasets in Python and SQL domain, our framework substantially outperforms heuristic methods with at least 15% higher F1 and accuracy. Furthermore, we present StaQC (Stack Overflow Question-Code pairs), the largest dataset to date of ~148K Python and ~120K SQL question-code pairs, automatically mined from SO using our framework. Under various case studies, we demonstrate that StaQC can greatly help develop data-hungry models for associating natural language with programming language"
Finding Subcube Heavy Hitters in Analytics Data Streams,"Modern data streams typically have high dimensionality. For example, digital analytics streams consist of user online activities (e.g., web browsing activity, commercial site activity, apps and social behavior, and response to ads). An important problem is to find frequent joint values (heavy hitters) of subsets of dimensions."
Conversational Query Understanding Using Sequence to Sequence Modeling,"Understanding conversations is crucial to enabling conversational search in technologies such as chatbots, digital assistants, and smart home devices that are becoming increasingly popular. Conventional search engines are powerful at answering open domain queries but are mostly capable of stateless search. In this paper, we define a conversational query as a query that depends on the context of the current conversation, and we formulate the conversational query understanding problem as context-aware query reformulation, where the goal is to reformulate the conversational query into a search engine friendly query in order to satisfy users» information needs in conversational settings. Such context-aware query reformulation problem lends itself to sequence to sequence modeling. We present a large scale open domain dataset of conversational queries and various sequence to sequence models that are learned from this dataset. The best model correctly reformulates over half of all conversational queries, showing the potential of sequence to sequence modeling for this task."
Privacy and Efficiency Tradeoffs for Multiword Top K Search with Linear Additive Rank Scoring,"This paper proposes a private ranking scheme with linear additive scoring for efficient top K keyword search on modest-sized cloud datasets. This scheme strikes for tradeoffs between privacy and efficiency by proposing single-round client-server collaboration with server-side partial ranking based on blinded feature weights with random masks. Client-side preprocessing includes query decomposition with chunked postings to facilitate earlier range intersection and fast access of server-side key-value stores. Server-side query processing deals with feature vector sparsity through optional feature matching and enables result filtering with query-dependent chunk-wide random masks for queries that yield too many matched documents. This paper provides details on indexing and run-time conjunctive query processing and presents an evaluation that assesses the accuracy, efficiency, and privacy tradeoffs of this scheme through five datasets with various sizes."
Manifold Learning for Rank Aggregation,"We address the task of fusing ranked lists of documents that are retrieved in response to a query. Past work on this task of rank aggregation often assumes that documents in the lists being fused are independent and that only the documents that are ranked high in many lists are likely to be relevant to a given topic. We propose manifold learning aggregation approaches, ManX and v-ManX, that build on the cluster hypothesis and exploit inter-document similarity information. ManX regularizes document fusion scores, so that documents that appear to be similar within a manifold, receive similar scores, whereas v-ManX first generates virtual adversarial documents and then regularizes the fusion scores of both original and virtual adversarial documents. Since aggregation methods built on the cluster hypothesis are computationally expensive, we adopt an optimization method that uses the top-k documents as anchors and considerably reduces the computational complexity of manifold-based methods, resulting in two efficient aggregation approaches, a-ManX and a-v-ManX. We assess the proposed approaches experimentally and show that they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art aggregation approaches, while a-ManX and a-v-ManX run faster than ManX, v-ManX, respectively."

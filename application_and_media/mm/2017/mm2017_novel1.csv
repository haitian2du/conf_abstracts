Exploring Outliers in Crowdsourced Ranking for QoE,"Outlier detection is a crucial part of robust evaluation for crowdsourceable assessment of Quality of Experience (QoE) and has attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose some simple and fast algorithms for outlier detection and robust QoE evaluation based on the nonconvex optimization principle. Several iterative procedures are designed with or without knowing the number of outliers in samples. Theoretical analysis is given to show that such procedures can reach statistically good estimates under mild conditions. Finally, experimental results with simulated and real-world crowdsourcing datasets show that the proposed algorithms could produce similar performance to Huber-LASSO approach in robust ranking, yet with nearly 8 or 90 times speed-up, without or with a prior knowledge on the sparsity size of outliers, respectively. Therefore the proposed methodology provides us a set of helpful tools for robust QoE evaluation with crowdsourcing data."
Fluency-Guided Cross-Lingual Image Captioning,"Image captioning has so far been explored mostly in English, as most available datasets are in this language. However, the application of image captioning should not be restricted by language. Only few studies have been conducted for image captioning in a cross-lingual setting. Different from these works that manually build a dataset for a target language, we aim to learn a cross-lingual captioning model fully from machine-translated sentences. To conquer the lack of fluency in the translated sentences, we propose in this paper a fluency-guided learning framework. The framework comprises a module to automatically estimate the fluency of the sentences and another module to utilize the estimated fluency scores to effectively train an image captioning model for the target language. As experiments on two bilingual (English-Chinese) datasets show, our approach improves both fluency and relevance of the generated captions in Chinese, but without using any manually written sentences from the target language."
Mr.MAPP: Mixed Reality for MAnaging Phantom Pain,"Phantom Limb Pain or simply, Phantom Pain is a severe chronic pain that is experienced as a vivid sensation of the pain in missing body part. Epidemiological studies obtained from a large samples indicate that the short-term incidence rate of the phantom limb pain is 72% [13], while long-term incidence rate (6 months after amputation) is 67%, [5, 13]. A wide spectrum of treatments developed for alleviating phantom limb pain includes the traditional mirror box therapy as well as recently developed virtual reality-based methods. Most of the virtual reality-based methods rely on 3D CAD models of the virtual limb, animating them using the motion data acquired either from patient's existing anatomical limb or myoelectric activity at patient's stump (of the amputated limb). Since motion activity is typically captured using body sensors (Electromyography, EMG, or inertial sensors), these methods are considered as invasive approaches. Further, in the case of virtual reality-based methods, the dependency on the pre-built 3D models degrades the immersive experience due to a mismatch in the skin color, clothes, artificial and rigid look and misalignment of the phantom limb."
Anti-camera LED Lighting,"This work is concerned with the protection of intellectual property rights and privacy against unpermitted uses of digital cameras. A technique of multispectral coded illumination (MSCI) with LED lights is proposed to defeat cameras capturing indoor scenes by inducing annoying color artifacts into the acquired images or video frames. The main idea of MSCI is to temporally modulate LED lights of different colors at certain frequencies so that they interfere with the rolling shutter of the camera, but at the same time the coded illumination appears to human eyes the same as steady white lighting."

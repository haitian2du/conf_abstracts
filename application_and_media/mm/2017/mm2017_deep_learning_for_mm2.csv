Detecting Temporal Proposal for Action Localization with Tree-structured Search Policy,"Understanding the semantics in videos is a complex but crucial task in video analysis. This paper focuses on localizing category-independent events, actions or other semantics in an untrimmed video, referred as salient temporal proposal localization. Traditional methods like sliding window have a high computational cost due to the densely sampling of different video segments. We propose a reinforcement learning based method, which trains a localizer that learns a search policy that, instead of exploring every video segment, finds an optimal search path to locate a salient proposal based on the currently observing video segment in a tree structure, therefore reduces the number of video segments fed into the proposal detector. In each search step, a localizer is trained to iteratively select the next sub-region containing salient proposals to continue the search, and a proposal detector is trained to recognize salient proposal from the sub-regions. The experiments demonstrate that our method is able to precisely detect salient proposals with a comparable recall and with much fewer candidate windows."
Learning Fashion Compatibility with Bidirectional LSTMs,"The ubiquity of online fashion shopping demands effective recommendation services for customers. In this paper, we study two types of fashion recommendation: (i) suggesting an item that matches existing components in a set to form a stylish outfit (a collection of fashion items), and (ii) generating an outfit with multimodal (images/text) specifications from a user. To this end, we propose to jointly learn a visual-semantic embedding and the compatibility relationships among fashion items in an end-to-end fashion. More specifically, we consider a fashion outfit to be a sequence (usually from top to bottom and then accessories) and each item in the outfit as a time step. Given the fashion items in an outfit, we train a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) model to sequentially predict the next item conditioned on previous ones to learn their compatibility relationships. Further, we learn a visual-semantic space by regressing image features to their semantic representations aiming to inject attribute and category information as a regularization for training the LSTM. The trained network can not only perform the aforementioned recommendations effectively but also predict the compatibility of a given outfit. We conduct extensive experiments on our newly collected Polyvore dataset, and the results provide strong qualitative and quantitative evidence that our framework outperforms alternative methods."
3D CNNs on Distance Matrices for Human Action Recognition,"In this paper we are interested in recognizing human actions from sequences of 3D skeleton data. For this purpose we combine a 3D Convolutional Neural Network with body representations based on Euclidean Distance Matrices (EDMs), which have been recently shown to be very effective to capture the geometric structure of the human pose. One inherent limitation of the EDMs, however, is that they are defined up to a permutation of the skeleton joints, i.e., randomly shuffling the ordering of the joints yields many different representations. In oder to address this issue we introduce a novel architecture that simultaneously, and in an end-to-end manner, learns an optimal transformation of the joints, while optimizing the rest of parameters of the convolutional network. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on 3 benchmarks, including the recent NTU RGB-D dataset, for which we improve on previous LSTM-based methods by more than 10 percentage points, also surpassing other CNN-based methods while using almost 1000 times fewer parameters."
Sync-DRAW: Automatic Video Generation using Deep Recurrent Attentive Architectures,"This paper introduces a novel approach for generating videos called Synchronized Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (Sync-DRAW). Sync-DRAW can also perform text-to-video generation which, to the best of our knowledge, makes it the first approach of its kind. It combines a Variational Autoencoder(VAE) with a Recurrent Attention Mechanism in a novel manner to create a temporally dependent sequence of frames that are gradually formed over time. The recurrent attention mechanism in Sync-DRAW attends to each individual frame of the video in sychronization, while the VAE learns a latent distribution for the entire video at the global level. Our experiments with Bouncing MNIST, KTH and UCF-101 suggest that Sync-DRAW is efficient in learning the spatial and temporal information of the videos and generates frames with high structural integrity, and can generate videos from simple captions on these datasets."

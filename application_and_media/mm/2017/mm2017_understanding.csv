Video Captioning with Guidance of Multimodal Latent Topics,"The topic diversity of open-domain videos leads to various vocabularies and linguistic expressions in describing video contents, and therefore, makes the video captioning task even more challenging. In this paper, we propose an unified caption framework, M&M TGM, which mines multimodal topics in unsupervised fashion from data and guides the caption decoder with these topics. Compared to pre-defined topics, the mined multimodal topics are more semantically and visually coherent and can reflect the topic distribution of videos better. We formulate the topic-aware caption generation as a multi-task learning problem, in which we add a parallel task, topic prediction, in addition to the caption task. For the topic prediction task, we use the mined topics as the teacher to train a student topic prediction model, which learns to predict the latent topics from multimodal contents of videos. The topic prediction provides intermediate supervision to the learning process. As for the caption task, we propose a novel topic-aware decoder to generate more accurate and detailed video descriptions with the guidance from latent topics. The entire learning procedure is end-to-end and it optimizes both tasks simultaneously. The results from extensive experiments conducted on the MSR-VTT and Youtube2Text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. M&M TGM not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics and on both benchmark datasets, but also achieves better generalization ability."
Learning Non-local Image Diffusion for Image Denoising,"Image diffusion plays a fundamental role for the task of image denoising. The recently proposed trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion (TNRD) model defines a simple but very effective framework for image denoising. However, as the TNRD model is a local model, whose diffusion behavior is purely controlled by information of local patches, it is prone to create artifacts in the homogenous regions and over-smooth highly textured regions, especially in the case of strong noise levels. Meanwhile, it is widely known that the non-local self-similarity (NSS) prior stands as an effective image prior for image denoising, which has been widely exploited in many non-local methods. In this work, we are highly motivated to embed the NSS prior into the TNRD model to tackle its weaknesses. In order to preserve the expected property that end-to-end training remains available, we exploit the NSS prior by defining a set of non-local filters, and derive our proposed trainable non-local reaction diffusion (TNLRD) model for image denoising. Together with the local filters and influence functions, the non-local filters are learned by employing loss-specific training. The experimental results show that the trained TNLRD model produces visually plausible recovered images with more textures and less artifacts, compared to its local versions. Moreover, the trained TNLRD model can achieve strongly competitive performance to recent state-of-the-art image denoising methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM)."
Weighted Sparse Representation Regularized Graph Learning for RGB-T Object Tracking,"In this paper, we propose a novel graph model, called weighted sparse representation regularized graph, to learn a robust object representation using multispectral (RGB and thermal) data for visual tracking. In particular, the tracked object is represented with a graph with image patches as nodes. This graph is dynamically learned from two aspects. First, the graph affinity (i.e., graph structure and edge weights) that indicates the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes is optimized based on the weighted sparse representation, in which the modality weight is introduced to leverage RGB and thermal information adaptively. Second, each node weight that indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground is propagated from others along with graph affinity. The optimized patch weights are then imposed on the extracted RGB and thermal features, and the target object is finally located by adopting the structured SVM algorithm. Moreover, we also contribute a comprehensive dataset for RGB-T tracking purpose. Comparing with existing ones, the new dataset has the following advantages: 1) Its size is sufficiently large for large-scale performance evaluation (total frame number: 210K, maximum frames per video pair: 8K). 2) The alignment between RGB-T video pairs is highly accurate, which does not need pre- and post-processing. 3) The occlusion levels are annotated for analyzing the occlusion-sensitive performance of different methods. Extensive experiments on both public and newly created datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracker against several state-of-the-art tracking methods."

Automatic Music Video Generation Based on Simultaneous Soundtrack Recommendation and Video Editing,"An automated process that can suggest a soundtrack to a user-generated video (UGV) and make the UGV a music-compliant professional-like video is challenging but desirable. To this end, this paper presents an automatic music video (MV) generation system that conducts soundtrack recommendation and video editing simultaneously. Given a long UGV, it is first divided into a sequence of fixed-length short (e.g., 2 seconds) segments, and then a multi-task deep neural network (MDNN) is applied to predict the pseudo acoustic (music) features (or called the pseudo song) from the visual (video) features of each video segment. In this way, the distance between any pair of video and music segments of same length can be computed in the music feature space. Second, the sequence of pseudo acoustic (music) features of the UGV and the sequence of the acoustic (music) features of each music track in the music collection are temporarily aligned by the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with a pseudo-song-based deep similarity matching (PDSM) metric. Third, for each music track, the video editing module selects and concatenates the segments of the UGV based on the target and concatenation costs given by a pseudo-song-based deep concatenation cost (PDCC) metric according to the DTW-aligned result to generate a music-compliant professional-like video. Finally, all the generated MVs are ranked, and the best MV is recommended to the user. The MDNN for pseudo song prediction and the PDSM and PDCC metrics are trained by an annotated official music video (OMV) corpus. The results of objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that the proposed system performs well and can generate appealing MVs with better viewing and listening experiences."
Region-Based Image Retrieval Revisited,"Region-based image retrieval (RBIR) technique is revisited. In early attempts at RBIR in the late 90s, researchers found many ways to specify region-based queries and spatial relationships; however, the way to characterize the regions, such as by using color histograms, were very poor at that time. Here, we revisit RBIR by incorporating semantic specification of objects and intuitive specification of spatial relationships. Our contributions are the following. First, to support multiple aspects of semantic object specification (category, instance, and attribute), we propose a multitask CNN feature that allows us to use deep learning technique and to jointly handle multi-aspect object specification. Second, to help users specify spatial relationships among objects in an intuitive way, we propose recommendation techniques of spatial relationships. In particular, by mining the search results, a system can recommend feasible spatial relationships among the objects. The system also can recommend likely spatial relationships by assigned object category names based on language prior. Moreover, object-level inverted indexing supports very fast shortlist generation, and re-ranking based on spatial constraints provides users with instant RBIR experiences."
Learning Multimodal Attention LSTM Networks for Video Captioning,"Automatic generation of video caption is a challenging task as video is an information-intensive media with complex variations. Most existing methods, either based on language templates or sequence learning, have treated video as a flat data sequence while ignoring intrinsic multimodality nature. Observing that different modalities (e.g., frame, motion, and audio streams), as well as the elements within each modality, contribute differently to the sentence generation, we present a novel deep framework to boost video captioning by learning Multimodal Attention Long-Short Term Memory networks (MA-LSTM). Our proposed MA-LSTM fully exploits both multimodal streams and temporal attention to selectively focus on specific elements during the sentence generation. Moreover, we design a novel child-sum fusion unit in the MA-LSTM to effectively combine different encoded modalities to the initial decoding states. Different from existing approaches that employ the same LSTM structure for different modalities, we train modality-specific LSTM to capture the intrinsic representations of individual modalities. The experiments on two benchmark datasets (MSVD and MSR-VTT) show that our MA-LSTM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 52.3 [emailÂ protected] and 70.4 CIDER-D metrics on MSVD dataset, respectively."

On Server Provisioning for Cloud Gaming,"Cloud gaming has gained significant popularity recently due to many important benefits such as removal of device constraints, instant-on and cross-platform, etc. The properties of intensive resource demands and dynamic workloads make cloud gaming appropriate to be supported by an elastic cloud platform. Facing a large user population, a fundamental problem is how to provide satisfactory cloud gaming service at modest cost. We observe that software maintenance cost could be substantial compared to server running cost in cloud gaming. In this paper, we address the server provisioning problem for cloud gaming to optimize both server running cost and software maintenance cost. We find that the distribution of game softwares among servers triggers a trade-off between the software maintenance cost and server running cost. We formulate the problem with a stochastic model and employ queueing theories to conduct solid theoretical analysis. We then propose several classes of algorithms to approximate the optimal solution. The proposed algorithms are evaluated by extensive experiments using real-world parameters. The results show that the proposed algorithms are computationally efficient, nearly cost-optimal and highly robust to dynamic changes."
FastShrinkage: Perceptually-aware Retargeting Toward Mobile Platforms,"Retargeting aims at adapting an original high-resolution photo/video to a low-resolution screen with an arbitrary aspect ratio. Conventional approaches are generally based on desktop PCs, since the computation might be intolerable for mobile platforms (especially when retargeting videos). Besides, only low-level visual features are exploited typically, whereas human visual perception is not well encoded. In this paper, we propose a novel retargeting framework which fast shrinks photo/video by leveraging human gaze behavior. Specifically, we first derive a geometry-preserved graph ranking algorithm, which efficiently selects a few salient object patches to mimic human gaze shifting path (GSP) when viewing each scenery. Afterward, an aggregation-based CNN is developed to hierarchically learn the deep representation for each GSP. Based on this, a probabilistic model is developed to learn the priors of the training photos which are marked as aesthetically-pleasing by professional photographers. We utilize the learned priors to efficiently shrink the corresponding GSP of a retargeted photo/video to be maximally similar to those from the training photos. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that: 1) our method consumes less than 35ms to retarget a 1024 × 768 photo (or a 1280 × 720 video frame) on popular iOS/Android devices, which is orders of magnitude faster than the conventional retargeting algorithms; 2) the retargeted photos/videos produced by our method outperform its competitors significantly based on the paired-comparison-based user study; and 3) the learned GSPs are highly indicative of human visual attention according to the human eye tracking experiments."
Real-time Monocular Dense Mapping for Augmented Reality,"Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a key enabling technique for many augmented reality (AR) applications. However, conventional methods for monocular SLAM can obtain only sparse or semi-dense maps in highly-textured image areas. Poorly-textured regions which widely exist in indoor and man-made urban environments can be hardly reconstructed, impeding interactions between virtual objects and real scenes in AR apps. In this paper,we present a novel method for real-time monocular dense mapping based on the piecewise planarity assumption for poorly textured regions. Specifically, a semi-dense map for highly-textured regions is first calculated by pixel matching and triangulation [6, 7]. Large textureless regions extracted by Maximally Stable Color Regions (MSCR) [11], which is a homogeneous-color region detector, are approximated using piecewise planar models which are estimated by the corresponding semi-dense 3D points and the proposed multi-plane segmentation algorithm. Plane models associated with the same 3D area across multiple overlapping views are linked and fused to ensure a consistent and accurate 3D reconstruction. Experimental results on two public datasets [15, 23] demonstrate that our method is 2.3X~2.9X faster than the state-of-the-art method DPPTAM [2], and meanwhile achieves better reconstruction accuracy and completeness. We also apply our method to a real AR application and live experiments with a hand-held camera demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in practical scenario."

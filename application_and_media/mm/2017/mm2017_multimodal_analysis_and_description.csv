Semi-Relaxation Supervised Hashing for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"Recently, some cross-modal hashing methods have been devised for cross-modal search task. Essentially, given a similarity matrix, most of these methods tackle a discrete optimization problem by separating it into two stages, i.e., first relaxing the binary constraints and finding a solution of the relaxed optimization problem, then quantizing the solution to obtain the binary codes. This scheme will generate large quantization error. Some discrete optimization methods have been proposed to tackle this; however, the generation of the binary codes is independent of the features in the original space, which makes it not robust to noise. To consider these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel supervised cross-modal hashing method---Semi-Relaxation Supervised Hashing (SRSH). It can learn the hash functions and the binary codes simultaneously. At the same time, to tackle the optimization problem, it relaxes a part of binary constraints, instead of all of them, by introducing an intermediate representation variable. By doing this, the quantization error can be reduced and the optimization problem can also be easily solved by an iterative algorithm proposed in this paper. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SRSH can obtain competitive results and outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised cross-modal hashing methods."
Cross-modal Recipe Retrieval with Rich Food Attributes,"Food is rich of visible (e.g., colour, shape) and procedural (e.g., cutting, cooking) attributes. Proper leveraging of these attributes, particularly the interplay among ingredients, cutting and cooking methods, for health-related applications has not been previously explored. This paper investigates cross-modal retrieval of recipes, specifically to retrieve a text-based recipe given a food picture as query. As similar ingredient composition can end up with wildly different dishes depending on the cooking and cutting procedures, the difficulty of retrieval originates from fine-grained recognition of rich attributes from pictures. With a multi-task deep learning model, this paper provides insights on the feasibility of predicting ingredient, cutting and cooking attributes for food recognition and recipe retrieval. In addition, localization of ingredient regions is also possible even when region-level training examples are not provided. Experiment results validate the merit of rich attributes when comparing to the recently proposed ingredient-only retrieval techniques."
Exploring the use of Time-Dependent Cross-Network Information for Personalized Recommendations,"The overwhelming volume and complexity of information in online applications make recommendation essential for users to find information of interest. However, two major limitations that coexist in real world applications (1) incomplete user profiles, and (2) the dynamic nature of user preferences continue to degrade recommender quality in aspects such as timeliness, accuracy, diversity and novelty. To address both the above limitations in a single solution, we propose a novel cross-network time aware recommender solution. The solution first learns historical user models in the target network by aggregating user preferences from multiple source networks. Second, user level time aware latent factors are learnt to develop current user models from the historical models and conduct timely recommendations. We illustrate our solution by using auxiliary information from the Twitter source network to improve recommendations for the YouTube target network. Experiments conducted using multiple time aware and cross-network baselines under different time granularities show that the proposed solution achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, novelty and diversity."

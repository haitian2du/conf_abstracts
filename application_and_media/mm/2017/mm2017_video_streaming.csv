16K Cinematic VR Streaming,"We present an end-to-end system for streaming Cinematic Virtual Reality (VR) content (also called 360 or omnidirectional content). Content is captured and ingested at a resolution of 16K at 25Hz and streamed towards untethered mobile VR devices. Besides the usual navigation interactions such as panning and tilting offered by common VR systems, we also provide a zooming interactivity. This allows the VR client to fetch high quality pixels captured at a spatial resolution of 16K that greatly increase perceived quality compared to a 4K VR streaming solution. Since current client devices are not capable of receiving and decoding a 16K video, several optimizations are provided to only stream the required pixels for the current viewport of the user, while meeting strict latency and bandwidth requirements for a qualitative VR immersive experience."
Where are the Sweet Spots?: A Systematic Approach to Reproducible DASH Player Comparisons,"The current body of research on Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) contributes various adaptation algorithms aiming to optimize performance metrics such as the Quality of Experience. Intuitively, the heterogeneity of the streaming environment and the underlying technologies lead many of the developed approaches to possess clear performance affinities denoted here as sweet spots. We observe, however, that systematic comparisons of these algorithms are usually conducted within homogeneous player environments."
Towards Forward-looking Online Bitrate Adaptation for DASH,"Many commercial video players rely on bitrate adaptation algorithm to adapt video bitrate to dynamic network condition. To achieve a high quality of experience, bitrate adaptation algorithm is required to strike a balance between response agility and video quality stability. Existing online algorithms select bitrates according to instantaneous throughput and buffer occupancy, achieving an agile reaction to changes but inducing video quality fluctuations due to the high dynamic of reference signals. In this paper, the idea of multi-step prediction is proposed to guide a better tradeoff, and the bitrate selection is formulated as a predictive control problem. With it, a generalized predictive control based approach is developed to calculate the optimal bitrate by minimizing the cost function over a moving look-ahead horizon. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented on a reference video player with performance evaluations conducted using realistic bandwidth traces. Experimental results show that the multi-step predictive control adaptation algorithm can achieve zero rebuffer event and 63.3% of reduction in bitrate switch."
QUETRA: A Queuing Theory Approach to DASH Rate Adaptation,"DASH, or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP, relies on a rate adaptation component to decide on which representation to download for each video segment. A plethora of rate adaptation algorithms has been proposed in recent years. The decisions of which bitrate to download made by these algorithms largely depend on several factors: estimated network throughput, buffer occupancy, and buffer capacity. Yet, these algorithms are not informed by a fundamental relationship between these factors and the chosen bitrate, and as a result, we found that they do not perform consistently in all scenarios, and require parameter tuning to work well under different buffer capacity. In this paper, we model a DASH client as an M/D/1/K queue, which allows us to calculate the expected buffer occupancy given a bitrate choice, network throughput, and buffer capacity. Using this model, we propose QUETRA, a simple rate adaptation algorithm. We evaluated QUETRA under a diverse set of scenarios and found that, despite its simplicity, it leads to better quality of experience (7% - 140%) than existing algorithms."

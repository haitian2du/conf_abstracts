Hashtag-centric Immersive Search on Social Media,"Social media information distributes in different Online Social Networks (OSNs). This paper addresses the problem integrating the cross-OSN information to facilitate an immersive social media search experience. We exploit hashtag, which is widely used to annotate and organize multi-modal items in different OSNs, as the bridge for information aggregation and organization. A three-stage solution framework is proposed for hashtag representation, clustering and demonstration. Given an event query, the related items from three OSNs, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube, are organized in cluster-hashtag-item hierarchy for display. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated by qualitative and quantitative experiments on hundreds of trending event queries."
Spatio-Temporal AutoEncoder for Video Anomaly Detection,"Anomalous events detection in real-world video scenes is a challenging problem due to the complexity of ""anomaly"" as well as the cluttered backgrounds, objects and motions in the scenes. Most existing methods use hand-crafted features in local spatial regions to identify anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Spatio-Temporal AutoEncoder (ST AutoEncoder or STAE), which utilizes deep neural networks to learn video representation automatically and extracts features from both spatial and temporal dimensions by performing 3-dimensional convolutions. In addition to the reconstruction loss used in existing typical autoencoders, we introduce a weight-decreasing prediction loss for generating future frames, which enhances the motion feature learning in videos. Since most anomaly detection datasets are restricted to appearance anomalies or unnatural motion anomalies, we collected a new challenging dataset comprising a set of real-world traffic surveillance videos. Several experiments are performed on both the public benchmarks and our traffic dataset, which show that our proposed method remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."
Deep Siamese Network with Multi-level Similarity Perception for Person Re-identification,"Person re-identification (re-ID), which aims at spotting a person of interest across multiple camera views, has gained more and more attention in computer vision community. In this paper, we propose a novel deep Siamese architecture based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-level similarity perception. According to the distinct characteristics of diverse feature maps, we effectively apply different similarity constraints to both low-level and high-level feature maps, during training stage. Therefore, our network can efficiently learn discriminative feature representations at different levels, which significantly improves the re-ID performance. Besides, our framework has two additional benefits. Firstly, classification constraints can be easily incorporated into the framework, forming a unified multi-task network with similarity constraints. Secondly, as similarity comparable information has been encoded in the network's learning parameters via back-propagation, pairwise input is not necessary at test time. That means we can extract features of each gallery image and build index in an off-line manner, which is essential for large-scale real-world applications. Experimental results on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves splendid performance compared with the current state-of-the-art approaches."

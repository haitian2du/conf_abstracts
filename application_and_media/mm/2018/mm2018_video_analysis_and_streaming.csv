End-to-End Blind Quality Assessment of Compressed Videos Using Deep Neural Networks,"Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) algorithms are traditionally designed with a two-stage approach - a feature extraction stage that computes typically hand-crafted spatial and/or temporal features, and a regression stage working in the feature space that predicts the perceptual quality of the video. Unlike the traditional BVQA methods, we propose a Video Multi-task End-to-end Optimized neural Network (V-MEON) that merges the two stages into one, where the feature extractor and the regressor are jointly optimized. Our model uses a multi-task DNN framework that not only estimates the perceptual quality of the test video but also provides a probabilistic prediction of its codec type. This framework allows us to train the network with two complementary sets of labels, both of which can be obtained at low cost. The training process is composed of two steps. In the first step, early convolutional layers are pre-trained to extract spatiotemporal quality-related features with the codec classification subtask. In the second step, initialized with the pre-trained feature extractor, the whole network is jointly optimized with the two subtasks together. An additional critical step is the adoption of 3D convolutional layers, which creates novel spatiotemporal features that lead to a significant performance boost. Experimental results show that the proposed model clearly outperforms state-of-the-art BVQA methods.The source code of V-MEON is available at https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~zduanmu/acmmm2018bvqa."
FlexStream: Towards Flexible Adaptive Video Streaming on End Devices using Extreme SDN,"We present FlexStream, a programmable framework realized by implementing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) functionality on end devices. FlexStream exploits the benefits of both centralized and distributed components to achieve dynamic management of end devices, as required and in accordance with specified policies. We evaluate FlexStream on one example use case -- the adaptive video streaming, where bandwidth control is employed to drive selection of video bitrates, improve stability and increase robustness against background traffic. When applied to competing streaming clients, FlexStream reduces bitrate switching by 81%, stall duration by 92%, and startup delay by 44%, while improving fairness among players. In addition, we report the first implementation of SDN-based control in Android devices running in real Wi-Fi and live cellular networks."
CLS: A Cross-user Learning based System for Improving QoE in 360-degree Video Adaptive Streaming,"Viewport adaptive streaming is emerging as a promising way to deliver high quality 360-degree video. It is still a critical issue to predict user's viewpoint and deliver partial video within the viewport. Current widely-used motion-based or content-saliency methods have low precision, especially for long-term prediction. In this paper, benefiting from data-driven learning, we propose a Cross-user Learning based System (CLS) to improve the precision of viewport prediction. Since users have similar region-of-interest (ROI) when watching a same video, it is possible to exploit cross-users' ROI behavior to predict viewport. We use a machine learning algorithm to group users according to historical fixations, and predict the viewing probability by the class. Additionally, we present a QoE-driven rate allocation to minimize the expected streaming distortion under bandwidth constraint, and give a Multiple-Choice Knapsack solution. Experiments demonstrate that CLS provides 2dB quality improvement than full-image streaming and 1.5 dB quality improvement than linear regression (LR) method. On average, the precision of viewpoint prediction improve 15% compared with LR."
A Distributed Approach for Bitrate Selection in HTTP Adaptive Streaming,"Past research has shown that concurrent HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) players behave selfishly and the resulting competition for shared resources leads to underutilization or oversubscription of the network, presentation quality instability and unfairness among the players, all of which adversely impact the viewer experience. While coordination among the players, as opposed to all being selfish, has its merits and may alleviate some of these issues. A fully distributed architecture is still desirable in many deployments and better reflects the design spirit of HAS. In this study, we focus on and propose a distributed bitrate adaptation scheme for HAS that borrows ideas from consensus and game theory frameworks. Experimental results show that the proposed distributed approach provides significant improvements in terms of viewer experience, presentation quality stability, fairness and network utilization, without using any explicit communication between the players."

GestureGAN for Hand Gesture-to-Gesture Translation in the Wild,"Hand gesture-to-gesture translation in the wild is a challenging task since hand gestures can have arbitrary poses, sizes, locations and self-occlusions. Therefore, this task requires a high-level understanding of the mapping between the input source gesture and the output target gesture. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel hand Gesture Generative Adversarial Network (GestureGAN). GestureGAN consists of a single generator G and a discriminator D, which takes as input a conditional hand image and a target hand skeleton image. GestureGAN utilizes the hand skeleton information explicitly, and learns the gesture-to-gesture mapping through two novel losses, the color loss and the cycle-consistency loss. The proposed color loss handles the issue of ""channel pollution"" while back-propagating the gradients. In addition, we present the Frechet ResNet Distance (FRD) to evaluate the quality of generated images. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed GestureGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the unconstrained hand gesture-to-gesture translation task. Meanwhile, the generated images are in high-quality and are photo-realistic, allowing them to be used as data augmentation to improve the performance of a hand gesture classifier. Our model and code are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/GestureGAN."
Beyond Narrative Description: Generating Poetry from Images by Multi-Adversarial Training,"Automatic generation of natural language from images has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we take one step further to investigate generation of poetic language (with multiple lines) to an image for automatic poetry creation. This task involves multiple challenges, including discovering poetic clues from the image (e.g., hope from green), and generating poems to satisfy both relevance to the image and poeticness in language level. To solve the above challenges, we formulate the task of poem generation into two correlated sub-tasks by multi-adversarial training via policy gradient, through which the cross-modal relevance and poetic language style can be ensured. To extract poetic clues from images, we propose to learn a deep coupled visual-poetic embedding, in which the poetic representation from objects, sentiments \footnoteWe consider both adjectives and verbs that can express emotions and feelings as sentiment words in this research. and scenes in an image can be jointly learned. Two discriminative networks are further introduced to guide the poem generation, including a multi-modal discriminator and a poem-style discriminator. To facilitate the research, we have released two poem datasets by human annotators with two distinct properties: 1) the first human annotated image-to-poem pair dataset (with $8,292$ pairs in total), and 2) to-date the largest public English poem corpus dataset (with $92,265$ different poems in total). Extensive experiments are conducted with 8K images, among which 1.5K image are randomly picked for evaluation. Both objective and subjective evaluations show the superior performances against the state-of-the-art methods for poem generation from images. Turing test carried out with over $500$ human subjects, among which 30 evaluators are poetry experts, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."
Understanding Humans in Crowded Scenes: Deep Nested Adversarial Learning and A New Benchmark for Multi-Human Parsing,"Despite the noticeable progress in perceptual tasks like detection, instance segmentation and human parsing, computers still perform unsatisfactorily on visually understanding humans in crowded scenes, such as group behavior analysis, person re-identification and autonomous driving, etc. To this end, models need to comprehensively perceive the semantic information and the differences between instances in a multi-human image, which is recently defined as the multi-human parsing task. In this paper, we present a new large-scale database ""Multi-Human Parsing (MHP)"" for algorithm development and evaluation, and advances the state-of-the-art in understanding humans in crowded scenes. MHP contains 25,403 elaborately annotated images with 58 fine-grained semantic category labels, involving 2-26 persons per image and captured in real-world scenes from various viewpoints, poses, occlusion, interactions and background. We further propose a novel deep Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) model for multi-human parsing. NAN consists of three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-like sub-nets, respectively performing semantic saliency prediction, instance-agnostic parsing and instance-aware clustering. These sub-nets form a nested structure and are carefully designed to learn jointly in an end-to-end way. NAN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions on our MHP and several other datasets, and serves as a strong baseline to drive the future research for multi-human parsing."
Knowledge-aware Multimodal Dialogue Systems,"By offering a natural way for information seeking, multimodal dialogue systems are attracting increasing attention in several domains such as retail, travel etc. However, most existing dialogue systems are limited to textual modality, which cannot be easily extended to capture the rich semantics in visual modality such as product images. For example, in fashion domain, the visual appearance of clothes and matching styles play a crucial role in understanding the user's intention. Without considering these, the dialogue agent may fail to generate desirable responses for users. In this paper, we present a Knowledge-aware Multimodal Dialogue (KMD) model to address the limitation of text-based dialogue systems. It gives special consideration to the semantics and domain knowledge revealed in visual content, and is featured with three key components. First, we build a taxonomy-based learning module to capture the fine-grained semantics in images the category and attributes of a product). Second, we propose an end-to-end neural conversational model to generate responses based on the conversation history, visual semantics, and domain knowledge. Lastly, to avoid inconsistent dialogues, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning method which accounts for future rewards to optimize the neural conversational model. We perform extensive evaluation on a multi-turn task-oriented dialogue dataset in fashion domain. Experiment results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the efficacy of modeling visual modality and domain knowledge for dialogue systems."

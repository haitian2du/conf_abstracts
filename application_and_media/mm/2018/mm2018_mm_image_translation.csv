Structure Guided Photorealistic Style Transfer,"Recent style transfer methods based on deep networks strive to generate more content matching stylized images by adding semantic guidance in the iterative process. However, these approaches can just guarantee the transfer of integral color and texture distribution between semantically equivalent regions, but local variation within these regions cannot be accurately captured. Therefore, the resulting image lacks local plausibility. To this end, we develop a non-parametric patch based style transfer framework to synthesize more content coherent images. By designing a novel patch matching algorithm which simultaneously takes high-level category information and geometric structure information (e.g., human pose and building structure) into account, our proposed method is capable of transferring more detailed distribution and producing more photorealistic stylized images. We show that our approach achieves remarkable style transfer results on contents with geometric structure, including human body, vehicles, buildings, etc."
Crossing-Domain Generative Adversarial Networks for Unsupervised Multi-Domain Image-to-Image Translation,"State-of-the-art techniques in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation from peer domain X to domain Y using paired image data. However, obtaining abundant paired data is a non-trivial and expensive process in the majority of applications. When there is a need to translate images across n domains, if the training is performed between every two domains, the complexity of the training will increase quadratically. Moreover, training with data from two domains only at a time cannot benefit from data of other domains, which prevents the extraction of more useful features and hinders the progress of this research area. In this work, we propose a general framework for unsupervised image-to-image translation across multiple domains, which can translate images from domain X to any a domain without requiring direct training between the two domains involved in image translation. A byproduct of the framework is the reduction of computing time and computing resources since it needs less time than training the domains in pairs as is done in state-of-the-art works. Our proposed framework consists of a pair of encoders along with a pair of GANs which learns high-level features across different domains to generate diverse and realistic samples from. Our framework shows competing results on many image-to-image tasks compared with state-of-the-art techniques."
Multi-View Image Generation from a Single-View,"How to generate multi-view images with realistic-looking appearance from only a single view input is a challenging problem. In this paper, we attack this problem by proposing a novel image generation model termed VariGANs, which combines the merits of the variational inference and the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It generates the target image in a coarse-to-fine manner instead of a single pass which suffers from severe artifacts. It first performs variational inference to model global appearance of the object (e.g., shape and color) and produces coarse images of different views. Conditioned on the generated coarse images, it then performs adversarial learning to fill details consistent with the input and generate the fine images. Extensive experiments conducted on two clothing datasets, MVC and DeepFashion, have demonstrated that the generated images with the proposed VariGANs are more plausible than those generated by existing approaches, which provide more consistent global appearance as well as richer and sharper details."
Sparsely Grouped Multi-Task Generative Adversarial Networks for Facial Attribute Manipulation,"Recently, Image-to-Image Translation (IIT) has achieved great progress in image style transfer and semantic context manipulation for images. However, existing approaches require exhaustively labelling training data, which is labor demanding, difficult to scale up, and hard to adapt to a new domain. To overcome such a key limitation, we propose Sparsely Grouped Generative Adversarial Networks (SG-GAN) as a novel approach that can translate images in sparsely grouped datasets where only a few train samples are labelled. Using a one-input multi-output architecture, SG-GAN is well-suited for tackling multi-task learning and sparsely grouped learning tasks. The new model is able to translate images among multiple groups using only a single trained model. To experimentally validate the advantages of the new model, we apply the proposed method to tackle a series of attribute manipulation tasks for facial images as a case study. Experimental results show that SG-GAN can achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on adequately labelled datasets while attaining a superior image translation quality on sparsely grouped datasets~\footnoteCode is available at https://github.com/zhangqianhui/SGGAN-tensorflow.."

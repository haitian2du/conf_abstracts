ModaNet: A Large-scale Street Fashion Dataset with Polygon Annotations,"Understanding clothes from a single image would have huge commercial and cultural impacts on modern societies. However, this task remains a challenging computer vision problem due to wide variations in the appearance, style, brand and layering of clothing items. We present a new database called ModaNet, a large-scale collection of images based on Paperdoll dataset. Our dataset provides 55,176 street images, fully annotated with polygons on top of the 1 million weakly annotated street images in Paperdoll. ModaNet aims to provide a technical benchmark to fairly evaluate the progress of applying the latest computer vision techniques that rely on large data for fashion understanding. The rich annotation of the dataset allows to measure the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms for object detection, semantic segmentation and polygon prediction on street fashion images in detail."
SLIONS: A Karaoke Application to Enhance Foreign Language Learning,"Singing songs can be an engaging and effective activity when learning a foreign language. In this paper, we describe a multi-language karaoke application called SLIONS: Singing and Listening to Improve Our Natural Speaking. When developing this application, we followed a user-centered design process which was informed by conducting interviews with domain experts, extensive usability testing, and reviewing existing gamified karaoke and language learning applications. The key feature of SLIONS is that we used automatic speech recognition (ASR) to provide students with personalized, granular feedback based on their singing pronunciation. We also provided multi-modal instruction: audio of music and singing tracks, video of a professional singer and translated text of lyrics to help students learn and master each song in the foreign language. To test the efficacy of SLIONS, we conducted a one-week pilot study with English and Chinese language learning students (N=15). The initial quantitative results show that our application can improve pronunciation and may improve vocabulary. In addition, the qualitative feedback from the students suggests that SLIONS is both fun to use and motivates students to practice speaking and singing in a foreign language."
Context-Aware Unsupervised Text Stylization,"In this work, we present a novel algorithm to stylize the text without supervision, which provides a flexible and convenient way to invoke fantastic text expressions. Rather than employing the fixed pair of target text and source style images, our unsupervised framework establishes an implicit mapping for them by using an abstract imagery of the style image as bridges. Based on the mapping, we progressively narrow the visual discrepancy between text and style images by the proposed legibility-preserving structure transfer and texture transfer algorithms, which effectively balance the text legibility and style consistency. Furthermore, we explore a seamless composition of the stylized text and a background image, in which the optimal text layout is determined by a context-aware layout design algorithm utilizing cues for both seamlessness and aesthetics. Given the layout, the text can be seamlessly embedded into the background by texture synthesis under a context-aware boundary constraint. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in automatic artistic typography creation and visual-textual presentation synthesis."
Songle Sync: A Large-Scale Web-based Platform for Controlling Various Devices in Synchronization with Music,"This paper presents Songle Sync, a web-based platform on which hundreds of Internet-connected devices - including smartphones, computers, and other physical computing devices - can be controlled to synchronize with music playback. It uses music-understanding technologies to dynamically synthesize music-driven multimedia performances from a musical piece of choice. To simultaneously control hundreds of devices, a conventional architecture keeps always-on connections between them. However, it does not scale and suffers from latency and jitter issues when there are various devices with potentially unstable networks. We address this with a novel autonomous control architecture in which each device is notified of forthcoming musical events (e.g., beats and chorus sections) to automatically drive various changes in multimedia performances. Moreover, we provide a development kit of an event-driven multimedia framework for JavaScript, example programs, and an interactive tutorial. To evaluate the platform, we compared latencies, jitters, and amounts of network traffic between ours and the conventional architecture. To examine use cases in the wild, we deployed the platform to drive over a hundred of a variety of devices. We also developed a web browser-based application for a multimedia performance with music playback. It provided audiences of hundreds with a bring-your-own-device experience of synchronized animations on smartphones. In addition, the development kit was used in a two-day hackathon. We report lessons learned from these studies and discuss the future of the Internet of Musical Things."

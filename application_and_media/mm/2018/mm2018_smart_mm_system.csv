Fine-Grained Grocery Product Recognition by One-Shot Learning,"Fine-grained grocery product recognition via camera is a challenging task to identify the visually similar products with subtle differences by using single-shot training examples. To address this issue? we present a novel hybrid classification approach that combines feature-based matching and one-shot deep learning with a coarse-to-fine strategy. The candidate regions of product instances are first detected and coarsely labeled by recurring features in product images without any training. Then, attention maps are generated to guide the classifier to focus on fine discriminative details by magnifying the influences of the features in the candidate regions of interest (ROI) and suppressing the interferences of the features outside, improving the accuracy of fine-grained grocery products recognition effectively. Our framework also performs a good adaptability which allows existing classifier to be refined without retraining for new coming product classes. As an additional contribution, we collect a new grocery product database with 102 classes from 2 stores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
Reconfigurable Inverted Index,"Existing approximate nearest neighbor search systems suffer from two fundamental problems that are of practical importance but have not received sufficient attention from the research community. First, although existing systems perform well for the whole database, it is difficult to run a search over a subset of the database. Second, there has been no discussion concerning the performance decrement after many items have been newly added to a system. We develop a reconfigurable inverted index (Rii) to resolve these two issues. Based on the standard IVFADC system, we design a data layout such that items are stored linearly. This enables us to efficiently run a subset search by switching the search method to a linear PQ scan if the size of a subset is small. Owing to the linear layout, the data structure can be dynamically adjusted after new items are added, maintaining the fast speed of the system. Extensive comparisons show that Rii achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the art systems such as Faiss."
"Robust Billboard-based, Free-viewpoint Video Synthesis Algorithm to Overcome Occlusions under Challenging Outdoor Sport Scenes","The paper proposes an algorithm to robustly reconstruct an accurate billboard model of an individual object including an occluded one in each camera. Each billboard model is utilized to synthesize high-quality, free-viewpoint video especially for outdoor sport scenes in which roughly calibrated cameras are sparsely placed. The two main contributions of the proposed algorithm are (1) robustness to occlusions caused by overlaps of multiple objects in every camera, that is one of the biggest issues for billboard-based method, and (2) applicability to challenging shooting conditions in which accurate 3D model cannot be reconstructed because of calibration errors, small number of cameras and so on. In order to achieve the contributions above, the algorithm does not try to reproduce an accurate 3D model of each object but utilize a ""rough 3D model"". The algorithm precisely extracts an individual object region in every camera by reconstructing a ""rough 3D model"" of each object and back-projecting it to every camera. The 3D coordinate for each billboard to be located is calculated based on the position of a rough 3D model. Experimental results compare the visual quality of free-viewpoint videos synthesized with our proposed method and conventional methods and show the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of the naturalness of positional relationships and the fineness of the surface textures of all the objects."
iHuman3D: Intelligent Human Body 3D Reconstruction using a Single Flying Camera,"Aiming at autonomous, adaptive and real-time human body reconstruction technique, this paper presents iHuman3D: an intelligent human body 3D reconstruction system using a single aerial robot integrated with an RGB-D camera. Specifically, we propose a real-time and active view planning strategy based on a highly efficient ray casting algorithm in GPU and a novel information gain formulation directly in TSDF. We also propose the human body reconstruction module by revising the traditional volumetric fusion pipeline with a compactly-designed non-rigid deformation for slight motion of the human target. We unify both the active view planning and human body reconstruction in the same TSDF volume-based representation. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted to validate that the proposed iHuman3D system effectively removes the constraint of extra manual labor, enabling real-time and autonomous reconstruction of human body."

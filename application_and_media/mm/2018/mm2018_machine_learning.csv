Visual Domain Adaptation with Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment,"Visual domain adaptation aims to learn robust classifiers for the target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. Existing methods either attempt to align the cross-domain distributions, or perform manifold subspace learning. However, there are two significant challenges: (1) degenerated feature transformation, which means that distribution alignment is often performed in the original feature space, where feature distortions are hard to overcome. On the other hand, subspace learning is not sufficient to reduce the distribution divergence. (2) unevaluated distribution alignment, which means that existing distribution alignment methods only align the marginal and conditional distributions with equal importance, while they fail to evaluate the different importance of these two distributions in real applications. In this paper, we propose a Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment (MEDA) approach to address these challenges. MEDA learns a domain-invariant classifier in Grassmann manifold with structural risk minimization, while performing dynamic distribution alignment to quantitatively account for the relative importance of marginal and conditional distributions. To the best of our knowledge, MEDA is the first attempt to perform dynamic distribution alignment for manifold domain adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MEDA shows significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art traditional and deep methods."
Causally Regularized Learning with Agnostic Data Selection Bias,"Most of previous machine learning algorithms are proposed based on the i.i.d. hypothesis. However, this ideal assumption is often violated in real applications, where selection bias may arise between training and testing process. Moreover, in many scenarios, the testing data is not even available during the training process, which makes the traditional methods like transfer learning infeasible due to their need on prior of test distribution. Therefore, how to address the agnostic selection bias for robust model learning is of paramount importance for both academic research and real applications. In this paper, under the assumption that causal relationships among variables are robust across domains, we incorporate causal technique into predictive modeling and propose a novel Causally Regularized Logistic Regression (CRLR) algorithm by jointly optimize global confounder balancing and weighted logistic regression. Global confounder balancing helps to identify causal features, whose causal effect on outcome are stable across domains, then performing logistic regression on those causal features constructs a robust predictive model against the agnostic bias. To validate the effectiveness of our CRLR algorithm, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that our CRLR algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and the interpretability of our method can be fully depicted by the feature visualization."
Robust Correlation Filter Tracking with Shepherded Instance-Aware Proposals,"In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) based correlation filter trackers have achieved state-of-the-art results on the benchmark datasets. However, the CNN based correlation filters cannot effectively handle large scale variation and distortion (such as fast motion, background clutter, occlusion, etc.), leading to the sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN based correlation filter tracker with shepherded instance-aware proposals, namely DeepCFIAP, which automatically estimates the target scale in each frame and re-detects the target when distortion happens. DeepCFIAP is proposed to take advantage of the merits of both instance-aware proposals and CNN based correlation filters. Compared with the CNN based correlation filter trackers, DeepCFIAP can successfully solve the problems of large scale variation and distortion via the shepherded instance-aware proposals, resulting in more robust tracking performance. Specifically, we develop a novel proposal ranking algorithm based on the similarities between proposals and instances. In contrast to the detection proposal based trackers, DeepCFIAP shepherds the instance-aware proposals towards their optimal positions via the CNN based correlation filters, resulting in more accurate tracking results. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DeepCFIAP performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers and it is especially feasible for long-term tracking."
A Unified Framework for Multimodal Domain Adaptation,"Domain adaptation aims to train a model on labeled data from a source domain while minimizing test error on a target domain. Most of existing domain adaptation methods only focus on reducing domain shift of single-modal data. In this paper, we consider a new problem of multimodal domain adaptation and propose a unified framework to solve it. The proposed multimodal domain adaptation neural networks(MDANN) consist of three important modules. (1) A covariant multimodal attention is designed to learn a common feature representation for multiple modalities. (2) A fusion module adaptively fuses attended features of different modalities. (3) Hybrid domain constraints are proposed to comprehensively learn domain-invariant features by constraining single modal features, fused features, and attention scores. Through jointly attending and fusing under an adversarial objective, the most discriminative and domain-adaptive parts of the features are adaptively fused together. Extensive experimental results on two real-world cross-domain applications (emotion recognition and cross-media retrieval) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Learning Semantic Structure-preserved Embeddings for Cross-modal Retrieval,"This paper learns semantic embeddings for multi-label cross-modal retrieval. Our method exploits the structure in semantics represented by label vectors to guide the learning of embeddings. First, we construct a semantic graph based on label vectors which incorporates data from both modalities, and enforce the embeddings to preserve the local structure of this semantic graph. Second, we enforce the embeddings to well reconstruct the labels, i.e., the global semantic structure. In addition, we encourage the embeddings to preserve local geometric structure of each modality. Accordingly, the local and global semantic structure consistencies as well as the local geometric structure consistency are enforced, simultaneously. The mappings between inputs and embeddings are designed to be nonlinear neural network with larger capacity and more flexibility. The overall objective function is optimized by stochastic gradient descent to gain the scalability on large datasets. Experiments conducted on three real world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods."
Post Tuned Hashing: A New Approach to Indexing High-dimensional Data,"Learning to hash has proven to be an effective solution for indexing high-dimensional data by projecting them to similarity-preserving binary codes. However, most existing methods end up the learning scheme with a binarization stage, i.e. binary quantization, which inevitably destroys the neighborhood structure of original data. As a result, those methods still suffer from great similarity loss and result in unsatisfactory indexing performance. In this paper we propose a novel hashing model, namely Post Tuned Hashing (PTH), which includes a new post-tuning stage to refine the binary codes after binarization. The post-tuning seeks to rebuild the destroyed neighborhood structure, and hence significantly improves the indexing performance. We cast the post-tuning into a binary quadratic optimization framework and, despite its NP-hardness, give a practical algorithm to efficiently obtain a high-quality solution. Experimental results on five noted image benchmarks show that our PTH improves previous state-of-the-art methods by 13-58% in mean average precision."
Cross-modal Moment Localization in Videos,"In this paper, we address the temporal moment localization issue, namely, localizing a video moment described by a natural language query in an untrimmed video. This is a general yet challenging vision-language task since it requires not only the localization of moments, but also the multimodal comprehension of textual-temporal information (e.g., ""first"" and ""leaving"") that helps to distinguish the desired moment from the others, especially those with the similar visual content. While existing studies treat a given language query as a single unit, we propose to decompose it into two components: the relevant cue related to the desired moment localization and the irrelevant one meaningless to the localization. This allows us to flexibly adapt to arbitrary queries in an end-to-end framework. In our proposed model, a language-temporal attention network is utilized to learn the word attention based on the temporal context information in the video. Therefore, our model can automatically select ""what words to listen to"" for localizing the desired moment. We evaluate the proposed model on two public benchmark datasets: DiDeMo and Charades-STA. The experimental results verify its superiority over several state-of-the-art methods."
Multi-Scale Correlation for Sequential Cross-modal Hashing Learning,"Cross-modal hashing aims to learn hash functions, which map heterogeneous multimedia data into common Hamming space for fast and flexible cross-modal retrieval. Recently, several cross-modal hashing methods learn the hash functions by mining the correlation among multimedia data. However, they ignore two properties of cross-modal data: 1) The features of different scale in single modality consist different information, such as texture, object and scene feature in the image, which can provide multi-scale information on retrieval task. 2) The correlation among the features of different modalities and scales can provide multi-scale relationship for better cross-modal hashing learning. In this paper, we propose Multi-scale Correlation Sequential Cross-modal Hashing Learning (MCSCH) approach. The main contributions of the MCSCH can be summarized as follows: 1) We propose a multi-scale feature guided sequential hashing learning method which sequentially generates the hash code guided by different scale features through a RNN based network. The multi-scale feature guided sequential hashing learning method utilizes the scale information, which enhances the diversity of the hash codes and reduces the error caused by extreme situation in specifc features. 2) We propose a multi-scale correlation mining strategy during the multi-scale feature guided sequential hashing learning, which can simultaneously mine the correlation among the features of different modalities and scales. Through this strategy, we can mine any pair of scale features in different modalities and obtain abundant scale correlation for better cross-modal retrieval. Experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MCSCH approach."
Generative Adversarial Product Quantisation,"Product Quantisation (PQ) has been recognised as an effective encoding technique for scalable multimedia content analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that enables an end-to-end encoding strategy from raw images to compact PQ codes. The system aims to learn both PQ encoding functions and codewords for content-based image retrieval. In detail, we first design a trainable encoding layer that is pluggable into neural networks, so the codewords can be trained in back-forward propagation. Then we integrate it into a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN). In our proposed encoding framework, the raw images are directly encoded by passing through the convolutional and encoding layers, and the generator aims to use the codewords as constrained inputs to generate full image representations that are visually similar to the original images. By taking the advantages of the generative adversarial model, our proposed system can produce high-quality PQ codewords and encoding functions for scalable multimedia retrieval tasks. Experiments show that the proposed architecture GA-PQ outperforms the state-of-the-art encoding techniques on three public image datasets."
Aesthetic-Driven Image Enhancement by Adversarial Learning,"We introduce EnhanceGAN, an adversarial learning based model that performs automatic image enhancement. Traditional image enhancement frameworks typically involve training models in a fully-supervised manner, which require expensive annotations in the form of aligned image pairs. In contrast to these approaches, our proposed EnhanceGAN only requires weak supervision (binary labels on image aesthetic quality) and is able to learn enhancement operators for the task of aesthetic-based image enhancement. In particular, we show the effectiveness of a piecewise color enhancement module trained with weak supervision, and extend the proposed EnhanceGAN framework to learning a deep filtering-based aesthetic enhancer. The full differentiability of our image enhancement operators enables the training of EnhanceGAN in an end-to-end manner. We further demonstrate the capability of EnhanceGAN in learning aesthetic-based image cropping without any groundtruth cropping pairs. Our weakly-supervised EnhanceGAN reports competitive quantitative results on aesthetic-based color enhancement as well as automatic image cropping, and a user study confirms that our image enhancement results are on par with or even preferred over professional enhancement."
Attention-based Multi-Patch Aggregation for Image Aesthetic Assessment,"Aggregation structures with explicit information, such as image attributes and scene semantics, are effective and popular for intelligent systems for assessing aesthetics of visual data. However, useful information may not be available due to the high cost of manual annotation and expert design. In this paper, we present a novel multi-patch (MP) aggregation method for image aesthetic assessment. Different from state-of-the-art methods, which augment an MP aggregation network with various visual attributes, we train the model in an end-to-end manner with aesthetic labels only (i.e., aesthetically positive or negative). We achieve the goal by resorting to an attention-based mechanism that adaptively adjusts the weight of each patch during the training process to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we propose a set of objectives with three typical attention mechanisms (i.e., average, minimum, and adaptive) and evaluate their effectiveness on the Aesthetic Visual Analysis (AVA) benchmark. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin. We further verify the effectiveness of the proposed attention-based objectives via ablation studies and shed light on the design of aesthetic assessment systems."
An End-to-End Quadrilateral Regression Network for Comic Panel Extraction,"Comic panel extraction, i.e., decomposing a comic page image into panels, has become a fundamental technique for meeting many practical needs of mobile comic reading such as comic content adaptation and comic animating. Most of existing approaches are based on handcrafted low-level visual patterns and heuristics rules, thus having limited ability to deal with irregular comic panels. Only one existing method is based on deep learning and achieves better experimental results, but its architecture is redundant and its time efficiency is not good. To address these problems, we propose an end-to-end, two-stage quadrilateral regressing network architecture for comic panel detection, which inherits the architecture of Faster R-CNN. At the first stage, we propose a quadrilateral region proposal network for generating panel proposals, based on a newly proposed quadrilateral regression method. At the second stage, we classify the proposals and refine their shapes with the proposed quadrilateral regression method again. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing comic panel detection methods on multiple datasets by F1-score and page accuracy."
Monocular Camera Based Real-Time Dense Mapping Using Generative Adversarial Network,"Monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a key enabling technique for many computer vision and robotics applications. However, existing methods either can obtain only sparse or semi-dense maps in highly-textured image areas or fail to achieve a satisfactory reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we present a new method based on a generative adversarial network,named DM-GAN, for real-time dense mapping based on a monocular camera. Specifcally, our depth generator network takes a semidense map obtained from motion stereo matching as a guidance to supervise dense depth prediction of a single RGB image. The depth generator is trained based on a combination of two loss functions, i.e. an adversarial loss for enforcing the generated depth maps to reside on the manifold of the true depth maps and a pixel-wise mean square error (MSE) for ensuring the correct absolute depth values. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our DM-GAN signifcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of greater reconstruction accuracy and higher depth completeness."
JPEG Decompression in the Homomorphic Encryption Domain,"Privacy-preserving processing is desirable for cloud computing to relieve users' concern of loss of control of their uploaded data. This may be fulfilled with homomorphic encryption. With widely used JPEG, it is desirable to enable JPEG decompression in the homomorphic encryption domain. This is a great challenge since JPEG decoding needs to determine a matched codeword, which then extracts a codeword-dependent number of coefficients. With no access to the information of encrypted content, a decoder does not know which codeword is matched, and thus cannot tell how many coefficients to extract, not to mention to compute their values. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enables JPEG decompression in the homomorphic encryption domain. The scheme applies a statically controlled iterative procedure to decode one coefficient per iteration. In one iteration, each codeword is compared with the bitstream to compute an encrypted Boolean that represents if the codeword is a match or not. Each codeword would produce an output coefficient and generate a new bitstream by dropping consumed bits as if it were a match. If a codeword is associated with more than one coefficient, the codeword is replaced with the codeword representing the remaining undecoded coefficients for the next decoding iteration. The summation of each codeword's output multiplied by its matching Boolean is the output of the current iteration. This is equivalent to selecting the output of a matched codeword. A side benefit of our statically controlled decoding procedure is that paralleled Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) is fully supported, wherein multiple plaintexts are encrypted into a single plaintext, and decoding a ciphertext block corresponds to decoding all corresponding plaintext blocks. SIMD also reduces the total size of ciphertexts of an image. Experimental results are reported to show the performance of our proposed scheme."
MiniView Layout for Bandwidth-Efficient 360-Degree Video,"With the recent increase in popularity of VR devices, 360-degree video has become increasingly popular. As more users experience this new medium, it will likely see further increases in popularity as users experience its greater immersiveness compared to traditional video streams. 360-degree video streams must encode the omnidirectional view, and, with current encoding techniques, these views require significantly higher bandwidth than traditional video streams. These larger bandwidth requirements comprise the main barrier toward wider adoption by video streaming services."
Real-time 3D Face-Eye Performance Capture of a Person Wearing VR Headset,"Teleconference or telepresence based on virtual reality (VR) head-mount display (HMD) device is a very interesting and promising application since HMD can provide immersive feelings for users. However, in order to facilitate face-to-face communications for HMD users, real-time 3D facial performance capture of a person wearing HMD is needed, which is a very challenging task due to the large occlusion caused by HMD. The existing limited solutions are very complex either in setting or in approach as well as lacking the performance capture of 3D eye gaze movement. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based solution for real-time 3D face-eye performance capture of HMD users without complex modification to devices. To address the issue of lacking training data, we generate massive pairs of HMD face-label dataset by data synthesis as well as collecting VR-IR eye dataset from multiple subjects. Then, we train a dense-fitting network for facial region and an eye gaze network to regress 3D eye model parameters. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our system can efficiently and effectively produce in real time a vivid personalized 3D avatar with the correct identity, pose, expression and eye motion corresponding to the HMD user."
Bridge the Gap Between VQA and Human Behavior on Omnidirectional Video: A Large-Scale Dataset and a Deep Learning Model,"Omnidirectional video enables spherical stimuli with the $360 \times 180^ \circ$ viewing range. Meanwhile, only the viewport region of omnidirectional video can be seen by the observer through head movement (HM), and an even smaller region within the viewport can be clearly perceived through eye movement (EM). Thus, the subjective quality of omnidirectional video may be correlated with HM and EM of human behavior. To fill in the gap between subjective quality and human behavior, this paper proposes a large-scale visual quality assessment (VQA) dataset of omnidirectional video, called VQA-OV, which collects 60 reference sequences and 540 impaired sequences. Our VQA-OV dataset provides not only the subjective quality scores of sequences but also the HM and EM data of subjects. By mining our dataset, we find that the subjective quality of omnidirectional video is indeed related to HM and EM. Hence, we develop a deep learning model, which embeds HM and EM, for objective VQA on omnidirectional video. Experimental results show that our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of VQA on omnidirectional video."
Tracking-assisted Weakly Supervised Online Visual Object Segmentation in Unconstrained Videos,"This paper tackles the task of online video object segmentation with weak supervision, i.e., labeling the target object and background with pixel-level accuracy in unconstrained videos, given only one bounding box information in the first frame. We present a novel tracking-assisted visual object segmentation framework to achieve this. On the one hand, initialized with a given bounding box in the first frame, the auxiliary object tracking module guides the segmentation module frame by frame by providing motion and region information, which is usually missing in semi-supervised methods. Moreover, compared with the unsupervised approach, our approach with such minimum supervision can focus on the target object without bringing unrelated objects into the final results. On the other hand, the video object segmentation module also improves the robustness of the visual object tracking module by pixel-level localization and objectness information. Thus, segmentation and tracking in our framework can mutually help each other in an online manner. To verify the generality and effectiveness of the proposed framework, we evaluate our weakly supervised method on two cross-domain datasets, i.e., the DAVIS and VOT2016 datasets, with the same configuration and parameter setting. Experimental results show the top performance of our method, which is even better than the leading semi-supervised methods. Furthermore, we conduct the extensive ablation study on our approach to investigate the influence of each component and main parameters."
ThoughtViz: Visualizing Human Thoughts Using Generative Adversarial Network,"Studying human brain signals has always gathered great attention from the scientific community. In Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research, for example, changes of brain signals in relation to specific tasks (e.g., thinking something) are detected and used to control machines. While extracting spatio-temporal cues from brain signals for classifying state of human mind is an explored path, decoding and visualizing brain states is new and futuristic. Following this latter direction, in this paper, we propose an approach that is able not only to read the mind, but also to decode and visualize human thoughts. More specifically, we analyze brain activity, recorded by an ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), of a subject while thinking about a digit, character or an object and synthesize visually the thought item. To accomplish this, we leverage the recent progress of adversarial learning by devising a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which takes, as input, encoded EEG signals and generates corresponding images. In addition, since collecting large EEG signals in not trivial, our GAN model allows for learning distributions with limited training data. Performance analysis carried out on three different datasets -- brain signals of multiple subjects thinking digits, characters, and objects -- show that our approach is able to effectively generate images from thoughts of a person. They also demonstrate that EEG signals encode explicitly cues from thoughts which can be effectively used for generating semantically relevant visualizations."
A Feature-Adaptive Semi-Supervised Framework for Co-saliency Detection,"Co-saliency detection, which refers to the discovery of common salient foreground regions in a group of relevant images, has attracted increasing attention due to its widespread applications in many vision tasks. Existing methods assemble features from multiple views toward a comprehensive representation, however overlook the efficacy disparity among various features in detecting co-saliency. This paper proposes a novel feature-adaptive semi-supervised (FASS) framework for co-saliency detection, which seamlessly integrates multi-view feature learning, graph structure optimization and co-saliency prediction in a unified solution. In particular, the FASS exploits the efficacy disparity of multi-view features at both view and element levels by a joint formulation of view-wise feature weighting and element-wise feature selection, leading to an effective representation robust to feature noise and redundancy as well as adaptive to the task at hand. It predicts co-saliency map by optimizing co-saliency label prorogation over a graph of both labeled and unlabeled image regions. The graph structure is optimized jointly with feature learning and co-saliency prediction to precisely characterize underlying correlation among regions. The FASS is thus able to produce satisfactory co-saliency map based on the effective exploration of multi-view features as well as inter-region correlation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., iCoseg, Cosal2015 and MSRC, have demonstrated that the proposed FASS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
iSPA-Net: Iterative Semantic Pose Alignment Network,"Understanding and extracting 3D information of objects from monocular 2D images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. In the task of 3D object pose estimation, recent data driven deep neural network based approaches suffer from scarcity of real images with 3D keypoint and pose annotations. Drawing inspiration from human cognition, where the annotators use a 3D CAD model as structural reference to acquire ground-truth viewpoints for real images; we propose an iterative Semantic Pose Alignment Network, called iSPA-Net. Our approach focuses on exploiting semantic 3D structural regularity to solve the task of fine-grained pose estimation by predicting viewpoint difference between a given pair of images. Such image comparison based approach also alleviates the problem of data scarcity and hence enhances scalability of the proposed approach for novel object categories with minimal annotation. The fine-grained object pose estimator is also aided by correspondence of learned spatial descriptor of the input image pair. The proposed pose alignment framework enjoys the faculty to refine its initial pose estimation in consecutive iterations by utilizing an online rendering setup along with effectiveness of a non-uniform bin classification of pose-difference. This enables iSPA-Net to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various real image viewpoint estimation datasets. Further, we demonstrate effectiveness of the approach for multiple applications. First, we show results for active object viewpoint localization to capture images from similar pose considering only a single image as pose reference. Second, we demonstrate the ability of the learned semantic correspondence to perform unsupervised part-segmentation transfer using only a single part-annotated 3D template model per object class. To encourage reproducible research, we have released the codes for our proposed algorithm."
Extractive Video Summarizer with Memory Augmented Neural Networks,"Online videos have been growing explosively in recent years. How to help human users efficiently browse videos becomes more and more important. Video summarization can automatically shorten a video through extracting key-shots from the raw video, which is helpful for digesting video data. State-of-the-art supervised video summarization algorithms directly learn from manually-created summaries to mimic the key-frame/key-shot selection criterion of humans. Humans usually create a summary after viewing and understanding the whole video, and the global attention mechanism capturing information from all video frames plays a key role in the summarization process. However, previous supervised approaches ignored the temporal relations or simply modeled local inter-dependency across frames. Motivated by this observation, we proposed a memory augmented extractive video summarizer, which utilizes an external memory to record visual information of the whole video with high capacity. With the external memory, the video summarizer simply predicts the importance score of a video shot based on the global understanding of the video frames. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms on the public SumMe and TVSum datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that the global attention modeling has two advantages: good transferring ability across datasets and high robustness to noisy videos."
Fully Point-wise Convolutional Neural Network for Modeling Statistical Regularities in Natural Images,"Modeling statistical regularity plays an essential role in ill-posed image processing problems. Recently, deep learning based methods have been presented to implicitly learn statistical representation of pixel distributions in natural images and leverage it as a constraint to facilitate subsequent tasks, such as color constancy and image dehazing. However, the existing CNN architecture is prone to variability and diversity of pixel intensity within and between local regions, which may result in inaccurate statistical representation. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel fully point-wise CNN architecture for modeling statistical regularities in natural images. Specifically, we propose to randomly shuffle the pixels in the origin images and leverage the shuffled image as input to make CNN more concerned with the statistical properties. Moreover, since the pixels in the shuffled image are independent identically distributed, we can replace all the large convolution kernels in CNN with point-wise (1*1) convolution kernels while maintaining the representation ability. Experimental results on two applications: color constancy and image dehazing, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed network over the existing architectures, i.e., using 1/10~1/100 network parameters and computational cost while achieving comparable performance."
Online Action Tube Detection via Resolving the Spatio-temporal Context Pattern,"At present, spatio-temporal action detection in the video is still a challenging problem, considering the complexity of the background, the variety of the action or the change of the viewpoint in the unconstrained environment. Most of current approaches solve the problem via a two-step processing: first detecting actions at each frame; then linking them, which neglects the continuity of the action and operates in an offline and batch processing manner. In this paper, we attempt to build an online action detection model that introduces the spatio-temporal coherence existed among action regions when performing action category inference and position localization. Specifically, we seek to represent the spatio-temporal context pattern via establishing an encoder-decoder model based on the convolutional recurrent network. The model accepts a video snippet as input and encodes the dynamic information of the action in the forward pass. During the backward pass, it resolves such information at each time instant for action detection via fusing the current static or motion cue. Additionally, we propose an incremental action tube generation algorithm, which accomplishes action bounding-boxes association, action label determination and the temporal trimming in a single pass. Our model takes in the appearance, motion or fused signals as input and is tested on two prevailing datasets, UCF-Sports and UCF-101. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which achieves a performance superior or comparable to compared existing approaches."
Enhancing Visual Question Answering Using Dropout,"Using dropout in Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a common practice to prevent overfitting. However, in multi-path networks, the current way to use dropout may cause two problems: the co-adaptations of neurons and the explosion of output variance. In this paper, we propose the coherent dropout and the siamese dropouy to solve the two problems, respectively. Specifically, in coherent dropout, all relevant dropout layers in multiple paths are forced to work coherently to maximize the ability of preventing neuron co-adaptations. We show that the coherent dropout is simple in implementation but very effective to overcome overfitting. As for the explosion of output variance, we develop a siamese dropout mechanism to explicitly minimize the difference between the two output vectors produced from the same input data during training phase. Such mechanism can reduce the gap between training and inference phases and make the VQA model more robust. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of coherent dropout and siamese dropout. And the results also show that our methods can bring additional improvements on the state-of-the-art VQA models."
Face-Voice Matching using Cross-modal Embeddings,"Face-voice matching is a task to find correspondence between faces and voices. Many researches in cognitive science have confirmed human ability in the face-voice matching tasks. Such ability is useful for creating natural human machine interaction systems and in many other applications. In this paper, we propose a face-voice matching model that learns cross-modal embeddings between face images and voice characteristics. We constructed a novel FVCeleb dataset which consists of face images and utterances from 1,078 persons. These persons were selected from the MS-Celeb-1M face image dataset and the VoxCeleb audio dataset. In two-alternative forced-choice matching task with an audio input and two face-image candidates of the same gender, our model achieved 62.2% and 56.5% accuracy on the FVCeleb and the subset of the GRID corpus, respectively. These results are very similar to human performance reported in cognitive science studies."
Deep Understanding of Cooking Procedure for Cross-modal Recipe Retrieval,"Finding a right recipe that describes the cooking procedure for a dish from just one picture is inherently a difficult problem. Food preparation undergoes a complex process involving raw ingredients, utensils, cutting and cooking operations. This process gives clues to the multimedia presentation of a dish (e.g., taste, colour, shape). However, the description of the process is implicit, implying only the \em cause of dish presentation rather than the visual \em effect that can be vividly observed on a picture. Therefore, different from other cross-modal retrieval problems in the literature, recipe search requires the understanding of textually described procedure to predict its possible consequence on visual appearance. In this paper, we approach this problem from the perspective of attention modeling. Specifically, we model the attention of words and sentences in a recipe and align them with its image feature such that both text and visual features share high similarity in multi-dimensional space. Through a large food dataset, Recipe1M, we empirically demonstrate that understanding the cooking procedure can lead to improvement in a large margin compared to the existing methods which mostly consider only ingredient information. Furthermore, with attention modeling, we show that language-specific named-entity extraction based on domain knowledge becomes optional. The result gives light to the feasibility of performing cross-lingual cross-modal recipe retrieval with off-the-shelf machine translation engines."
Decoupled Novel Object Captioner,"Image captioning is a challenging task where the machine automatically describes an image by sentences or phrases. It often requires a large number of paired image-sentence annotations for training. However, a pre-trained captioning model can hardly be applied to a new domain in which some novel object categories exist, i.e., the objects and their description words are unseen during model training. To correctly caption the novel object, it requires professional human workers to annotate the images by sentences with the novel words. It is labor expensive and thus limits its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the zero-shot novel object captioning task where the machine generates descriptions without extra training sentences about the novel object. To tackle the challenging problem, we propose a Decoupled Novel Object Captioner (DNOC) framework that can fully decouple the language sequence model from the object descriptions. DNOC has two components. 1) A Sequence Model with the Placeholder (SM-P) generates a sentence containing placeholders. The placeholder represents an unseen novel object. Thus, the sequence model can be decoupled from the novel object descriptions. 2) A key-value object memory built upon the freely available detection model, contains the visual information and the corresponding word for each object. A query generated from the SM-P is used to retrieve the words from the object memory. The placeholder will further be filled with the correct word, resulting in a caption with novel object descriptions. The experimental results on the held-out MSCOCO dataset demonstrate the ability of DNOC in describing novel concepts."
Temporal Cross-Media Retrieval with Soft-Smoothing,"Multimedia information have strong temporal correlations that shape the way modalities co-occur over time. In this paper we study the dynamic nature of multimedia and social-media information, where the temporal dimension emerges as a strong source of evidence for learning the temporal correlations across visual and textual modalities. So far, cross-media retrieval models, explored the correlations between different modalities (e.g. text and image) to learn a common subspace, in which semantically similar instances lie in the same neighbourhood. Building on such knowledge, we propose a novel temporal cross-media neural architecture, that departs from standard cross-media methods, by explicitly accounting for the temporal dimension through temporal subspace learning. The model is softly-constrained with temporal and inter-modality constraints that guide the new subspace learning task by favouring temporal correlations between semantically similar and temporally close instances. Experiments on three distinct datasets show that accounting for time turns out to be important for cross-media retrieval. Namely, the proposed method outperforms a set of baselines on the task of temporal cross-media retrieval, demonstrating its effectiveness for performing temporal subspace learning."
Photo Squarization by Deep Multi-Operator Retargeting,"Squared forms of photos are widely used in social media as album covers or thumbnails of image streams. In this study, we realize photo squarization by modeling Retargeting Visual Perception Issues, which reflect human perception preference toward image ratargeting. General image retargeting techniques deal with three common issues, namely, salient content, object shape, and scene composition, to preserve the important information of original image. We propose a new way based on multi-operator techniques to investigate human behavior in balancing the three issues. We establish a new dataset and observe human behavior by inviting investigators to retarget images to square manually. We propose a data-driven approach composed of perception and distillation modules by using deep learning techniques to predict human perception preference. The perception part learns the relations among the three issues, and the distillation part transfers the learned relations to a simple but effective network. Our study contributes to deep learning literature by optimizing a network index and lightening its running burden. Experimental results show that photo squarization results generated by the proposed model are consistent with human visual perception results."
Non-locally Enhanced Encoder-Decoder Network for Single Image De-raining,"Single image rain streaks removal has recently witnessed substantial progress due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks. However, existing deep learning based methods either focus on the entrance and exit of the network by decomposing the input image into high and low frequency information and employing residual learning to reduce the mapping range, or focus on the introduction of cascaded learning scheme to decompose the task of rain streaks removal into multi-stages. These methods treat the convolutional neural network as an encapsulated end-to-end mapping module without deepening into the rationality and superiority of neural network design. In this paper, we delve into an effective end-to-end neural network structure for stronger feature expression and spatial correlation learning. Specifically, we propose a non-locally enhanced encoder-decoder network framework, which consists of a pooling indices embedded encoder-decoder network to efficiently learn increasingly abstract feature representation for more accurate rain streaks modeling while perfectly preserving the image detail. The proposed encoder-decoder framework is composed of a series of non-locally enhanced dense blocks that are designed to not only fully exploit hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers but also well capture the long-distance dependencies and structural information. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove rain-streaks on rainy image of various densities while well preserving the image details, which achieves significant improvements over the recent state-of-the-art methods."
An ADMM-Based Universal Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known vulnerable to adversarial attacks. That is, adversarial examples, obtained by adding delicately crafted distortions onto original legal inputs, can mislead a DNN to classify them as any target labels. In a successful adversarial attack, the targeted mis-classification should be achieved with the minimal distortion added. In the literature, the added distortions are usually measured by $L_0$, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_\infty $ norms, namely, L_0, L_1, L_2, and L_∞ attacks, respectively. However, there lacks a versatile framework for all types of adversarial attacks. This work for the first time unifies the methods of generating adversarial examples by leveraging ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), an operator splitting optimization approach, such that $L_0$, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_\infty $ attacks can be effectively implemented by this general framework with little modifications. Comparing with the state-of-the-art attacks in each category, our ADMM-based attacks are so far the strongest, achieving both the 100% attack success rate and the minimal distortion."
Local Convolutional Neural Networks for Person Re-Identification,"Recent works have shown that person re-identification can be substantially improved by introducing attention mechanisms, which allow learning both global and local representations. However, all these works learn global and local features in separate branches. As a consequence, the interaction/boosting of global and local information are not allowed, except in the final feature embedding layer. In this paper, we propose local operations as a generic family of building blocks for synthesizing global and local information in any layer. This building block can be inserted into any convolutional networks with only a small amount of prior knowledge about the approximate locations of local parts. For the task of person re-identification, even with only one local block inserted, our local convolutional neural networks (Local CNN) can outperform state-of-the-art methods consistently on three large-scale benchmarks, including Market-1501, CUHK03, and DukeMTMC-ReID."
Conditional Expression Synthesis with Face Parsing Transformation,"Facial expression synthesis with various intensities is a challenging synthesis task due to large identity appearance variations and a paucity of efficient means for intensity measurement. This paper advances the expression synthesis domain by the introduction of a Couple-Agent Face Parsing based Generative Adversarial Network (CAFP-GAN) that unites the knowledge of facial semantic regions and controllable expression signals. Specially, we employ a face parsing map as a controllable condition to guide facial texture generation with a special expression, which can provide a semantic representation of every pixel of facial regions. Our method consists of two sub-networks: face parsing prediction network (FPPN) uses controllable labels (expression and intensity) to generate a face parsing map transformation that corresponds to the labels from the input neutral face, and facial expression synthesis network (FESN) makes the pretrained FPPN as a part of it to provide the face parsing map as a guidance for expression synthesis. To enhance the reality of results, couple-agent discriminators are served to distinguish fake-real pairs in both two sub-nets. Moreover, we only need the neutral face and the labels to synthesize the unknown expression with different intensities. Experimental results on three popular facial expression databases show that our method has the compelling ability on continuous expression synthesis."
Attentive Recurrent Neural Network for Weak-supervised Multi-label Image Classification,"Multi-label image classification is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision, and recently achieved significant progress by exploiting semantic relations among labels. However, the spatial positions of labels for multi-labels images are usually not provided in real scenarios, which brings insuperable barrier to conventional models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end attentive recurrent neural network for multi-label image classification under only image-level supervision, which learns the discriminative feature representations and models the label relations simultaneously. First, inspired by attention mechanism, we propose a recurrent highlight network (RHN) which focuses on the most related regions in the image to learn the discriminative feature representations for different objects in an iterative manner. Second, we develop a gated recurrent relation extractor (GRRE) to model the label relations using multiplicative gates in a recurrent fashion, which learns to decide how multiple labels of the image influence the relation extraction. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-arts, and performs better on small-object categories and under the scenario with large number of labels."
Deep Cross Modal Learning for Caricature Verification and Identification (CaVINet),"Learning from different modalities is a challenging task. In this paper, we look at the challenging problem of cross modal face verification and recognition between caricature and visual image modalities. Caricature have exaggerations of facial features of a person. Due to the significant variations in the caricatures, building vision models for recognizing and verifying data from this modality is an extremely challenging task. Visual images with significantly lesser amount of distortions can act as a bridge for the analysis of caricature modality. We introduce a publicly available large Caricature-VIsual dataset [CaVI] with images from both the modalities that captures the rich variations in the caricature of an identity. This paper presents the first cross modal architecture that handles extreme distortions of caricatures using a deep learning network that learns similar representations across the modalities. We use two convolutional networks along with transformations that are subjected to orthogonality constraints to capture the shared and modality specific representations. In contrast to prior research, our approach neither depends on manually extracted facial landmarks for learning the representations, nor on the identities of the person for performing verification. The learned shared representation achieves 91% accuracy for verifying unseen images and 75% accuracy on unseen identities. Further, recognizing the identity in the image by knowledge transfer using a combination of shared and modality specific representations, resulted in an unprecedented performance of 85% rank-1 accuracy for caricatures and 95% rank-1 accuracy for visual images."
Few-Shot Adaptation for Multimedia Semantic Indexing,"We propose a few-shot adaptation framework, which bridges zero-shot learning and supervised many-shot learning, for semantic indexing of image and video data. Few-shot adaptation provides robust parameter estimation with few training examples, by optimizing the parameters of zero-shot learning and supervised many-shot learning simultaneously. In this method, first we build a zero-shot detector, and then update it by using the few examples. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three datasets: TRECVID Semantic Indexing 2010, 2014, and ImageNET. On the ImageNET dataset, we show that our method outperforms recent few-shot learning methods. On the TRECVID 2014 dataset, we achieve 15.19~% and 35.98~% in Mean Average Precision under the zero-shot condition and the supervised condition, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results on this dataset."
Fashion Sensitive Clothing Recommendation Using Hierarchical Collocation Model,"Automatic clothing recommendation grows dramatically due to the booming of apparel e-commerce. In this paper, we propose a novel clothing recommendation approach which is sensitive to the fashion trend. The proposed approach incorporates the expert knowledge into multiple dimensional information including purchase behaviors, image contents and product descriptions so as to provide recommendation of clothing in line with the forefront of fashion. Meanwhile, to meet with human visual aesthetics and user's collocation experience, we propose the integration of the convolutional neural network and the hierarchical collocation model (HCM) into our framework. The former is to extract effective visual features and attribute descriptors from the clothing items, while the latter embeds them into the concept of style topics which interpret the collocation pattern from a higher level of semantic knowledge. Such a data driven recommendation approach is able to learn clothing collocation metric from multi-dimensional clothing information. Experimental results show that our HCM method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, it also ensures the fashion sensitivity of the recommended outfits."
Multi-Scale Context Attention Network for Image Retrieval,"Recent attempts on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image retrieval usually adopt the output of a specific convolutional or fully connected layer as feature representation. Though superior representation capability has yielded better retrieval performance, the scale variation and clutter distracting remain to be two challenging problems in CNN based image retrieval. In this work, we propose a Multi-Scale Context Attention Network (MSCAN) to generate global descriptors, which is able to selectively focus on the informative regions with the assistance of multi-scale context information. We model the multi-scale context information by an improved Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network across different layers. As such, the proposed global descriptor is equipped with the scale aware attention capability. Experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively capture the informative regions in images and retain reliable attention responses when encountering scale variation and clutter distracting. Moreover, we compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the state-of-the-art global descriptors, and extensive results verify that the proposed MSCAN can achieve superior performance on several image retrieval benchmarks."
Comprehensive Distance-Preserving Autoencoders for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"In this paper, we propose a novel method with comprehensive distance-preserving autoencoders (CDPAE) to address the problem of unsupervised cross-modal retrieval. Previous unsupervised methods rely primarily on pairwise distances of representations extracted from cross media spaces that co-occur and belong to the same objects. However, besides pairwise distances, the CDPAE also considers heterogeneous distances of representations extracted from cross media spaces as well as homogeneous distances of representations extracted from single media spaces that belong to different objects. The CDPAE consists of four components. First, denoising autoencoders are used to retain the information from the representations and to reduce the negative influence of redundant noises. Second, a comprehensive distance-preserving common space is proposed to explore the correlations among different representations. This aims to preserve the respective distances between the representations within the common space so that they are consistent with the distances in their original media spaces. Third, a novel joint loss function is defined to simultaneously calculate the reconstruction loss of the denoising autoencoders and the correlation loss of the comprehensive distance-preserving common space. Finally, an unsupervised cross-modal similarity measurement is proposed to further improve the retrieval performance. This is carried out by calculating the marginal probability of two media objects based on a kNN classifier. The CDPAE is tested on four public datasets with two cross-modal retrieval tasks: ""query images by texts"" and ""query texts by images"". Compared with eight state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval methods, the experimental results demonstrate that the CDPAE outperforms all the unsupervised methods and performs competitively with the supervised methods."
Temporal Hierarchical Attention at Category- and Item-Level for Micro-Video Click-Through Prediction,"Micro-video sharing gains great popularity in recent years, which calls for effective recommendation algorithm to help user find their interested micro-videos. Compared with traditional online (e.g. YouTube) videos, micro-videos contributed by grass-root users and taken by smartphones are much shorter (tens of seconds) and more short of tags or descriptive text, making the recommendation of micro-videos a challenging task. In this paper, we investigate how to model user's historical behaviors so as to predict the user's click-through of micro-videos. Inspired by the recent deep network-based methods, we propose a Temporal Hierarchical Attention at Category- and Item-Level (THACIL) network for user behavior modeling. First, we use temporal windows to capture the short-term dynamics of user interests; Second, we leverage a category-level attention mechanism to characterize user's diverse interests, as well as an item-level attention mechanism for fine-grained profiling of user interests; Third, we adopt forward multi-head self-attention to capture the long-term correlation within user behaviors. Our proposed THACIL network was tested on MicroVideo-1.7M, a new dataset of 1.7 million micro-videos, coming from real data of a micro-video sharing service in China. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions."
Historical Context-based Style Classification of Painting Images via Label Distribution Learning,"Analyzing and categorizing the style of visual art images, especially paintings, is gaining popularity owing to its importance in understanding and appreciating the art. The evolution of painting style is both continuous, in a sense that new styles may inherit, develop or even mutate from their predecessors and multi-modal because of various issues such as the visual appearance, the birthplace, the origin time and the art movement. Motivated by this peculiarity, we introduce a novel knowledge distilling strategy to assist visual feature learning in the convolutional neural network for painting style classification. More specifically, a multi-factor distribution is employed as soft-labels to distill complementary information with visual input, which extracts from different historical context via label distribution learning. The proposed method is well-encapsulated in a multi-task learning framework which allows end-to-end training. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches on Painting91, OilPainting, and Pandora datasets."
Direction-aware Neural Style Transfer,"Neural learning methods have been shown to be effective in style transfer. These methods, which are called NST, aim to synthesize a new image that retains the high-level structure of a content image while keeps the low-level features of a style image. However, these models using convolutional structures only extract local statistical features of style images and semantic features of content images. Since the absence of low-level features in the content image, these methods would synthesize images that look unnatural and full of traces of machines. In this paper, we find that direction, that is, the orientation of each painting stroke, can capture the soul of image style preferably and thus generates much more natural and vivid stylizations. According to this observation, we propose a Direction-aware Neural Style Transfer (DaNST) with two major innovations. First, a novel direction field loss is proposed to steer the direction of strokes in the synthesized image. And to build this loss function, we propose novel direction field loss networks to generate and compare the direction fields of content image and synthesized image. By incorporating the direction field loss in neural style transfer, we obtain a new optimization objective. Through minimizing this objective, we can produce synthesized images that better follow the direction field of the content image. Second, our method provides a simple interaction mechanism to control the generated direction fields, and further control the texture direction in synthesized images. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art in most styles such as oil painting and mosaic."
ChipGAN: A Generative Adversarial Network for Chinese Ink Wash Painting Style Transfer,"Style transfer has been successfully applied on photos to generate realistic western paintings. However, because of the inherently different painting techniques adopted by Chinese and western paintings, directly applying existing methods cannot generate satisfactory results for Chinese ink wash painting style transfer. This paper proposes ChipGAN, an end-to-end Generative Adversarial Network based architecture for photo to Chinese ink wash painting style transfer. The core modules of ChipGAN enforce three constraints -- voids, brush strokes, and ink wash tone and diffusion -- to address three key techniques commonly adopted in Chinese ink wash painting. We conduct stylization perceptual study to score the similarity of generated paintings to real paintings by consulting with professional artists based on the newly built Chinese ink wash photo and image dataset. The advantages in visual quality compared with state-of-the-art networks and high stylization perceptual study scores show the effectiveness of the proposed method."
CloudVR: Cloud Accelerated Interactive Mobile Virtual Reality,"High quality immersive Virtual Reality experience currently requires a PC setup with cable connected head mounted display, which is expensive and restricts user mobility. This paper presents CloudVR which is a system for cloud accelerated interactive mobile VR. It is designed to provide short rotation and interaction latencies through panoramic rendering and dynamic object placement. CloudVR also includes rendering optimizations to reduce server-side computational load and bandwidth requirements between the server and client. Performance measurements with a CloudVR prototype suggest that the optimizations make it possible to double the server's framerate and halve the amount of bandwidth required and that small objects can be quickly moved at run time to client device for rendering to provide shorter interaction latency. A small-scale user study indicates that CloudVR users do not notice small network latencies (20ms) and even much longer ones (100-200ms) become non-trivial to detect when they do not affect the interaction with objects. Finally, we present a design of CloudVR extension to multi-user scenarios."
Your Attention is Unique: Detecting 360-Degree Video Saliency in Head-Mounted Display for Head Movement Prediction,"Head movement prediction is the key enabler for the emerging 360-degree videos since it can enhance both streaming and rendering efficiency. To achieve accurate head movement prediction, it becomes imperative to understand user's visual attention on 360-degree videos under head-mounted display (HMD). Despite the rich history of saliency detection research, we observe that traditional models are designed for regular images/videos fixed at a single viewport and would introduce problems such as central bias and multi-object confusion when applied to the multi-viewport 360-degree videos switched by user interaction. To fill in this gap, this paper shifts the traditional single-viewport saliency models that have been extensively studied for decades to a fresh panoramic saliency detection specifically tailored for 360-degree videos, and thus maximally enhances the head movement prediction performance. The proposed head movement prediction framework is empowered by a newly created dataset for 360-degree video saliency, a panoramic saliency detection model and an integration of saliency and head tracking history for the ultimate head movement prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the measurable gain of both the proposed panoramic saliency detection and head movement prediction over traditional models for regular images/videos."
Hybrid Point Cloud Attribute Compression Using Slice-based Layered Structure and Block-based Intra Prediction,"Point cloud compression is a key enabler for the emerging applications of immersive visual communication, autonomous driving and smart cities, etc. In this paper, we propose a hybrid point cloud attribute compression scheme built on an original layered data structure. First, a slice partition scheme and a geometry-adaptive k-dimensional tree (k-d tree) method are devised to generate layer structures. Second, we introduce an efficient block-based intra prediction scheme containing to exploit spatial correlations among adjacent points. Third, an adaptive transform scheme based on Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) is Lagrangian optimized to achieve better transform efficiency. The Lagrange multiplier is off-line derived based on the statistics of attribute coding. Last but not least, multiple scan modes are dedicated to improve coding efficiency for entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art region-adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT) system, and on average a 37.21% BD-rate gain is achieved. Comparing with the test model for category 1 (TMC1) anchors, which were recently published by MPEG-3DG group on 121st MPEG meeting, a 8.81% BD-rate gain is obtained."
QARC: Video Quality Aware Rate Control for Real-Time Video Streaming based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Real-time video streaming is now one of the main applications in all network environments. Due to the fluctuation of throughput under various network conditions, how to choose a proper bitrate adaptively has become an upcoming and interesting issue. To tackle this problem, most proposed rate control methods work for providing high video bitrates instead of video qualities. Nevertheless, we notice that there exists a trade-off between sending bitrate and video quality, which motivates us to focus on how to reach a balance between them."
Optimizing Personalized Interaction Experience in Crowd-Interactive Livecast: A Cloud-Edge Approach,"Enabling users to interact with broadcasters and audience, the crowd-interactive livecast greatly improves viewer's quality of experience (QoE) and attracts millions of daily active users recently. In addition to striking the balance between resource utilization and viewers' QoE met in the traditional video streaming service, this novel service needs to take supererogatory efforts to improve the interaction QoE, which reflects the viewer interaction experience. To tackle this issue, we conduct measurement studies over a large-scale dataset crawled from a representative livecast service provider. We observe that the individual's interaction pattern is quite heterogeneous: only 10% viewers proactively participate in the interaction, and the rest viewers usually watch passively. Incorporating the insight into the emerging cloud-edge architecture, we propose a framework PIECE, which optimizes the Personalized Interaction Experience with Cloud-Edge architecture (PIECE) for intelligent user access control and livecast distribution. In particular, we first devise a novel deep neural network based algorithm to predict users' interaction intensity using the historical viewer pattern. We then design an algorithm to maximize the individual's QoE, by strategically matching viewer sessions and transcoding-delivery paths over cloud-edge infrastructure. Finally, we use trace-driven experiments to verify the effectiveness of PIECE. Our results show that our prediction algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms with a much smaller mean absolute error (40% reduction). Furthermore, in comparison with the cloud-based video delivery strategy, the proposed framework can simultaneously improve the average viewers QoE (26% improvement) and interaction QoE (21% improvement), while maintaining a high streaming bitrate."

Supervised Online Hashing via Hadamard Codebook Learning,"In recent years, binary code learning, a.k.a. hashing, has received extensive attention in large-scale multimedia retrieval. It aims to encode high-dimensional data points into binary codes, hence the original high-dimensional metric space can be efficiently approximated via Hamming space. However, most existing hashing methods adopted offline batch learning, which is not suitable to handle incremental datasets with streaming data or new instances. In contrast, the robustness of the existing online hashing remains as an open problem, while the embedding of supervised/semantic information hardly boosts the performance of the online hashing, mainly due to the defect of unknown category numbers in supervised learning. In this paper, we propose an online hashing scheme, termed Hadamard Codebook based Online Hashing (HCOH), which aims to solving the above problems towards robust and supervised online hashing. In particular, we first assign an appropriate high-dimensional binary codes to each class label, which is generated randomly by Hadamard codes. Subsequently, LSH is adopted to reduce the length of such Hadamard codes in accordance with the hash bits, which can adapt the predefined binary codes online, and theoretically guarantee the semantic similarity. Finally, we consider the setting of stochastic data acquisition, which facilitates our method to efficiently learn the corresponding hashing functions via stochastic gradient descend (SGD) online. Notably, the proposed HCOH can be embedded with supervised labels and is not limited to a predefined category number. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate the merits of the proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art methods."
Cascaded Feature Augmentation with Diffusion for Image Retrieval,"Recently, as an effective re-ranking technique, diffusion has attracted considerable attention in research on image retrieval. It inherits from random surfer model and is effective to deeply explore data manifold structure. However, as a common practice, diffusion is performed at query time which relies heavily on initial retrieval shortlists and suffers the bottleneck of online time-efficiency. To this end, in this paper, we present a more generalized method named CFA (cascaded feature augmentation) based on diffusion. First of all, we transfer diffusion process from online stage to offline stage and innovatively utilize output of diffusion to augment database features in a cascaded mode, which can eliminate iteration process at query time radically. Second, to scale the diffusion method to large image database, we propose a cascaded cluster diffusion technique for feature augmentation which largely reduces computational cost. Third, we extend our cascaded feature augmentation scheme to cases with multiple features without involving extra memory and time cost. Our CFA is compatible with other re-ranking methods. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm."
Deep Priority Hashing,"Deep hashing enables image retrieval by end-to-end learning of deep representations and hash codes from training data with pairwise similarity information. Subject to the distribution skewness underlying the similarity information, most existing deep hashing methods may underperform for imbalanced data due to misspecified loss functions. This paper presents Deep Priority Hashing (DPH), an end-to-end architecture that generates compact and balanced hash codes in a Bayesian learning framework. The main idea is to reshape the standard cross-entropy loss for similarity-preserving learning such that it down-weighs the loss associated to highly-confident pairs. This idea leads to a novel priority cross-entropy loss, which prioritizes the training on uncertain pairs over confident pairs. Also, we propose another priority quantization loss, which prioritizes hard-to-quantize examples for generation of nearly lossless hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPH can generate high-quality hash codes and yield state-of-the-art image retrieval results on three datasets, ImageNet, NUS-WIDE, and MS-COCO."
Fast Discrete Cross-modal Hashing With Regressing From Semantic Labels,"Hashing has recently received great attention in cross-modal retrieval. Cross-modal retrieval aims at retrieving information across heterogeneous modalities (e.g., texts vs. images). Cross-modal hashing compresses heterogeneous high-dimensional data into compact binary codes with similarity preserving, which provides efficiency and facility in both retrieval and storage. In this study, we propose a novel fast discrete cross-modal hashing (FDCH) method with regressing from semantic labels to take advantage of supervised labels to improve retrieval performance. In contrast to existing methods that learn the projection from hash codes to semantic labels, the proposed FDCH regresses the semantic labels of training examples to the corresponding hash codes with a drift. It not only accelerates the hash learning process, but also helps generate stable hash codes. Furthermore, the drift can adjust the regression and enhance the discriminative capability of hash codes. Especially in the case of training efficiency, FDCH is much faster than existing methods. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art techniques on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superiority of FDCH under various cross-modal retrieval scenarios."

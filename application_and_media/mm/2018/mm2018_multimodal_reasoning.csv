Visual Spatial Attention Network for Relationship Detection,"Visual relationship detection, which aims to predict a <subject, predicate, object> triplet with the detected objects, has attracted increasing attention in the scene understanding study. During tackling this problem, dealing with varying scales of the subjects and objects is of great importance, which has been less studied. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Vision Spatial Attention Network (VSA-Net), which employs a two-dimensional normal distribution attention scheme to effectively model small objects. In addition, we design a Subject-Object-layer (SO-layer) to distinguish between the subject and object to attain more precise results. To the best of our knowledge, VSA-Net is the first end-to-end attention mechanism based visual relationship detection model. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets (VRD and VG) show that, by using pure vision information, our VSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance for predicate detection, phrase detection, and relationship detection."
Object-Difference Attention: A Simple Relational Attention for Visual Question Answering,"Attention mechanism has greatly promoted the development of Visual Question Answering (VQA). Attention distribution, which weights differently on objects (such as image regions or bounding boxes) in an image according to their importance for answering a question, plays a crucial role in attention mechanism. Most of the existing work focuses on fusing image features and text features to calculate the attention distribution without comparisons between different image objects. As a major property of attention, selectivity depends on comparisons between different objects. Comparisons provide more information for assigning attentions better. For achieving this, we propose an object-difference attention (ODA) which calculates the probability of attention by implementing difference operator between different image objects in an image under the guidance of questions in hand. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets show our ODA based VQA model achieves the state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, a general form of relational attention is proposed. Besides ODA, several other relational attentions are given. Experimental results show those relational attentions have strengths on different types of questions."
Life-long Cross-media Correlation Learning,"With the numerous and dynamically increasing of multimedia data, such as image and text, lying in different domains, there arise two major challenges for cross-media retrieval. First, measuring the similarities for cross-media correlation between different media types is quite difficult, due to their inconsistent distributions and representations. Second, storing and retraining on such data becomes infeasible, because data of new domain arrives in sequence while the existing ones are not always available. Thus, it requires to only utilize the data of new domain for training while preserving the original correlation capabilities simultaneously. To address the above issues, in this paper we propose Cross-media Life-long Learning (CmLL) approach, which can leverage the knowledge learned from the existing data, to obtain better correlation performance in new domain. The main contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Cross-media adapting network. We construct hierarchical network to not only share the knowledge from different media types in high level, but also realize life-long learning on new cross-media domain by expanding network capacity adaptively, which can support the adaptivity and extensibility for cross-media correlation learning. (2) Cross-media life-long learning. We propose both intra-domain distribution alignment as well as inter-domain knowledge distillation, which can not only effectively preserve the correlation ability in old cross-media domains, but also improve the performance in new domain by transferring knowledge among different domains. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed CmLL approach, which are performed on multiple cross-media datasets for different domains under lifelong learning scenarios."
Human Conversation Analysis Using Attentive Multimodal Networks with Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder,"Human conversation analysis is challenging because the meaning can be expressed through words, intonation, or even body language and facial expression. We introduce a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure with attention mechanism for conversation analysis. The hierarchical encoder learns word-level features from video, audio, and text data that are then formulated into conversation-level features. The corresponding hierarchical decoder is able to predict different attributes at given time instances. To integrate multiple sensory inputs, we introduce a novel fusion strategy with modality attention. We evaluated our system on published emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and speaker trait analysis datasets. Our system outperformed previous state-of-the-art approaches in both classification and regressions tasks on three datasets. We also outperformed previous approaches in generalization tests on two commonly used datasets. We achieved comparable performance in predicting co-existing labels using the proposed model instead of multiple individual models. In addition, the easily-visualized modality and temporal attention demonstrated that the proposed attention mechanism helps feature selection and improves model interpretability."

Text-to-image Synthesis via Symmetrical Distillation Networks,"Text-to-image synthesis aims to automatically generate images according to text descriptions given by users, which is a highly challenging task. The main issues of text-to-image synthesis lie in two gaps: the heterogeneous and homogeneous gaps. The heterogeneous gap is between the high-level concepts of text descriptions and the pixel-level contents of images, while the homogeneous gap exists between synthetic image distributions and real image distributions. For addressing these problems, we exploit the excellent capability of generic discriminative models (e.g. VGG19), which can guide the training process of a new generative model on multiple levels to bridge the two gaps. The high-level representations can teach the generative model to extract necessary visual information from text descriptions, which can bridge the heterogeneous gap. The mid-level and low-level representations can lead it to learn structures and details of images respectively, which relieves the homogeneous gap. Therefore, we propose Symmetrical Distillation Networks (SDN) composed of a source discriminative model as ""teacher"" and a target generative model as ""student"". The target generative model has a symmetrical structure with the source discriminative model, in order to transfer hierarchical knowledge accessibly. Moreover, we decompose the training process into two stages with different distillation paradigms for promoting the performance of the target generative model. Experiments on two widely-used datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed SDN."
Context-Aware Visual Policy Network for Sequence-Level Image Captioning,"Many vision-language tasks can be reduced to the problem of sequence prediction for natural language output. In particular, recent advances in image captioning use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to alleviate the ""exposure bias'' during training: ground-truth subsequence is exposed in every step prediction, which introduces bias in test when only predicted subsequence is seen. However, existing RL-based image captioning methods only focus on the language policy while not the visual policy (eg, visual attention), and thus fail to capture the visual context that are crucial for compositional reasoning such as visual relationships (\eg, ""man riding horse'') and comparisons (eg. ""smaller cat""). To fill the gap, we propose a Context-Aware Visual Policy network (CAVP) for sequence-level image captioning. At every time step, CAVP explicitly accounts for the previous visual attentions as the context, and then decides whether the context is helpful for the current word generation given the current visual attention. Compared against traditional visual attention that only fixes a single image region at every step, CAVP can attend to complex visual compositions over time. The whole image captioning model --- CAVP and its subsequent language policy network --- can be efficiently optimized end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient method with respect to any caption evaluation metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAVP by state-of-the-art performances on MS-COCO offline split and online server, using various metrics and sensible visualizations of qualitative visual context.

SibNet: Sibling Convolutional Encoder for Video Captioning,"Video captioning is a challenging task owing to the complexity of understanding the copious visual information in videos and describing it using natural language. Different from previous work that encodes video information using a single flow, in this work, we introduce a novel Sibling Convolutional Encoder (SibNet) for video captioning, which utilizes a two-branch architecture to collaboratively encode videos. The first content branch encodes the visual content information of the video via autoencoder, and the second semantic branch encodes the semantic information by visual-semantic joint embedding. Then both branches are effectively combined with soft-attention mechanism and finally fed into a RNN decoder to generate captions. With our SibNet explicitly capturing both content and semantic information, the proposed method can better represent the rich information in videos. Extensive experiments on YouTube2Text and MSR-VTT datasets validate that the proposed architecture outperforms existing methods by a large margin across different evaluation metrics."
Paragraph Generation Network with Visual Relationship Detection,"Paragraph generation of images is a new concept, aiming to produce multiple sentences to describe a given image. In this paper, we propose a paragraph generation network with introducing visual relationship detection. We first detect regions which may contain important visual objects and then predict their relationships. Paragraphs are produced based on object regions which have valid relationship with others. Compared with previous works which generate sentences based on region features, we explicitly explore and utilize visual relationships in order to improve final captions. The experimental results show that such strategy could improve paragraph generating performance from two aspects: more details about object relations are detected and more accurate sentences are obtained. Furthermore, our model is more robust to region detection fluctuation."

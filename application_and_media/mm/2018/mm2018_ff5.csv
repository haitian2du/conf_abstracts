Online Inter-Camera Trajectory Association Exploiting Person Re-Identification and Camera Topology,"Online inter-camera trajectory association is a promising topic in intelligent video surveillance, which concentrates on associating trajectories belong to the same individual across different cameras according to time. It remains challenging due to the inconsistent appearance of a person in different cameras and the lack of spatio-temporal constraints between cameras. Besides, the orientation variations and the partial occlusions significantly increase the difficulty of inter-camera trajectory association. Targeting to solve these problems, this work proposes an orientation-driven person re-identification (ODPR) and an effective camera topology estimation based on appearance features for online inter-camera trajectory association. ODPR explicitly leverages the orientation cues and stable torso features to learn discriminative feature representations for identifying trajectories across cameras, which alleviates the pedestrian orientation variations by the designed orientation-driven loss function and orientation aware weights. The effective camera topology estimation introduces appearance features to generate the correct spatio-temporal constraints for narrowing the retrieval range, which improves the time efficiency and provides the possibility for intelligent inter-camera trajectory association in large-scale surveillance environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on the popular person re-identification datasets and the public multi-target, multi-camera tracking benchmark."
Learning Local Descriptors with Adversarial Enhancer from Volumetric Geometry Patches,"Local matching problems (e.g. key point matching, geometry registration) are significant but challenging tasks in computer vision field. In this paper, we propose to learn a robust local 3D descriptor from volumetric point patches to tackle the local matching tasks. Intuitively, given two inputs, it would be easy for a network to map the inputs to a space with similar characteristics (e.g. similar outputs for similar inputs, far different outputs for far different inputs), but the difficult case for a network would be to map the inputs into a space with opposite characteristics (e.g. far different outputs for very similar inputs but very similar outputs for far different inputs). Inspired by this intuition, in our proposed method, we design a siamese-network-based local descriptor generator to learn a local descriptor with small distances between match pairs and large distances between non-match pairs. Specifically, an adversarial enhancer is introduced to map the outputs of the local descriptor generator into an opposite space that match pairs have the maximum differences and non-match pairs have the minimum differences. The local descriptor generator and the adversarial enhancer are trained in an adversarial manner. By competing with the adversarial enhancer, the local descriptor generator learns to generate a much stronger descriptor for given volumetric point patches. The experiments conducted on real-world scan datasets, including 7-scenes and SUN3D, and the synthetic scan augmented ICL-NUIM dataset show that our method can achieve superior performance over other state-of-the-art approaches on both keypoint matching and geometry registration, such as fragment alignment and scene reconstruction."
Context-Dependent Diffusion Network for Visual Relationship Detection,"Visual relationship detection can bridge the gap between computer vision and natural language for scene understanding of images. Different from pure object recognition tasks, the relation triplets of subject-predicate-object lie on an extreme diversity space, such asperson-behind-person andcar-behind-building, while suffering from the problem of combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose a context-dependent diffusion network (CDDN) framework to deal with visual relationship detection. To capture the interactions of different object instances, two types of graphs, word semantic graph and visual scene graph, are constructed to encode global context interdependency. The semantic graph is built through language priors to model semantic correlations across objects, whilst the visual scene graph defines the connections of scene objects so as to utilize the surrounding scene information. For the graph-structured data, we design a diffusion network to adaptively aggregate information from contexts, which can effectively learn latent representations of visual relationships and well cater to visual relationship detection in view of its isomorphic invariance to graphs. Experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is more effective and achieves the state-of-the-art performance."
Connectionist Temporal Fusion for Sign Language Translation,"Continuous sign language translation (CSLT) is a weakly supervised problem aiming at translating vision-based videos into natural languages under complicated sign linguistics, where the ordered words in a sentence label have no exact boundary of each sign action in the video. This paper proposes a hybrid deep architecture which consists of a temporal convolution module (TCOV), a bidirectional gated recurrent unit module (BGRU), and a fusion layer module (FL) to address the CSLT problem. TCOV captures short-term temporal transition on adjacent clip features (local pattern), while BGRU keeps the long-term context transition across temporal dimension (global pattern). FL concatenates the feature embedding of TCOV and BGRU to learn their complementary relationship (mutual pattern). Thus we propose a joint connectionist temporal fusion (CTF) mechanism to utilize the merit of each module. The proposed joint CTC loss optimization and deep classification score-based decoding fusion strategy are designed to boost performance. With only once training, our model under the CTC constraints achieves comparable performance to other existing methods with multiple EM iterations. Experiments are tested and verified on a benchmark, i.e. the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."
Support Neighbor Loss for Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (re-ID) has recently been tremendously boosted due to the advancement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The majority of deep re-ID methods focus on designing new CNN architectures, while less attention is paid on investigating the loss functions. Verification loss and identification loss are two types of losses widely used to train various deep re-ID models, both of which however have limitations. Verification loss guides the networks to generate feature embeddings of which the intra-class variance is decreased while the inter-class ones is enlarged. However, training networks with verification loss tends to be of slow convergence and unstable performance when the number of training samples is large. On the other hand, identification loss has good separating and scalable property. But its neglect to explicitly reduce the intra-class variance limits its performance on re-ID, because the same person may have significant appearance disparity across different camera views. To avoid the limitations of the two types of losses, we propose a new loss, called support neighbor (SN) loss. Rather than being derived from data sample pairs or triplets, SN loss is calculated based on the positive and negative support neighbor sets of each anchor sample, which contain more valuable contextual information and neighborhood structure that are beneficial for more stable performance. To ensure scalability and separability, a softmax-like function is formulated to push apart the positive and negative support sets. To reduce intra-class variance, the distance between the anchor's nearest positive neighbor and furthest positive sample is penalized. Integrating SN loss on top of Resnet50, superior re-ID results to the state-of-the-art ones are obtained on several widely used datasets."
Perceptual Temporal Incoherence Aware Stereo Video Retargeting,"Stereo video retargeting aims to avoid shape and depth distortions while maintaining temporal coherence of shape and depth while resizing a stereo video to a desired size. Existing methods resort to extending stereo image retargeting schemes to stereo video retargeting by imposing temporal constraints to consistently resize all corresponding regions so as to maintain temporal coherence. However, such a direct extension often incurs conflicts among the requirements for preserving shape information and depth information and maintaining their temporal coherence, thereby failing to meet one or more of these requirements. We find that properly relaxing temporal constraints for non-paired regions at frame boundaries can effectively mitigate conflicts among depth, shape, and temporal constraints without severely degrading temporal coherence perceptually. Based on this new finding, we derive effective temporal constraints to improve the viewing experience of a 3D scene for stereo video retargeting. Accordingly, we propose an efficient grid-based implementation for our method. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior visual quality over existing methods."
A Large-scale RGB-D Database for Arbitrary-view Human Action Recognition,"Current researches mainly focus on single-view and multiview human action recognition, which can hardly satisfy the requirements of human-robot interaction (HRI) applications to recognize actions from arbitrary views. The lack of databases also sets up barriers. In this paper, we newly collect a large-scale RGB-D action database for arbitrary-view action analysis, including RGB videos, depth and skeleton sequences. The database includes action samples captured in 8 fixed viewpoints and varying-view sequences which covers the entire 360 view angles. In total, 118 persons are invited to act 40 action categories, and 25,600 video samples are collected. Our database involves more articipants, more viewpoints and a large number of samples. More importantly, it is the first database containing the entire 360? varying-view sequences. The database provides sufficient data for cross-view and arbitrary-view action analysis. Besides, we propose a View-guided Skeleton CNN (VS-CNN) to tackle the problem of arbitrary-view action recognition. Experiment results show that the VS-CNN achieves superior performance."
Spotting and Aggregating Salient Regions for Video Captioning,"Towards an interpretable video captioning process, we target to locate salient regions of video objects along with the sequentially uttering words. This paper proposes a new framework to automatically spot salient regions in each video frame and simultaneously learn a discriminative spatio-temporal representation for video captioning. First, in a Spot Module, we automatically learn the saliency value of each location to separate salient regions from video content as the foreground and the rest as background by two operations of 'hard separation' and 'soft separation', respectively. Then, in an Aggregate Module, to aggregate the foreground/background descriptors into a discriminative spatio-temporal representation, we devise a trainable video VLAD process to learn the aggregation parameters. Finally, we utilize the attention mechanism to decode the spatio-temporal representations of different regions into video descriptions. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods in terms of [email protected], METEOR and CIDEr metrics for the task of video captioning. Also examples demonstrate our method can successfully utter words to sequentially salient regions of video objects."
Adaptive Temporal Encoding Network for Video Instance-level Human Parsing,"Beyond the existing single-person and multiple-person human parsing tasks in static images, this paper makes the first attempt to investigate a more realistic video instance-level human parsing that simultaneously segments out each person instance and parses each instance into more fine-grained parts (\eg, head, leg, dress). We introduce a novel Adaptive Temporal Encoding Network (ATEN) that alternatively performs temporal encoding among key frames and flow-guided feature propagation from other consecutive frames between two key frames. Specifically, ATEN first incorporates a Parsing-RCNN to produce the instance-level parsing result for each key frame, which integrates both the global human parsing and instance-level human segmentation into a unified model. To balance between accuracy and efficiency, the flow-guided feature propagation is used to directly parse consecutive frames according to their identified temporal consistency with key frames. On the other hand, ATEN leverages the convolution gated recurrent units (convGRU) to exploit temporal changes over a series of key frames, which are further used to facilitate the frame-level instance-level parsing. By alternatively performing direct feature propagation between consistent frames and temporal encoding network among key frames, our ATEN achieves a good balance between frame-level accuracy and time efficiency, which is a common crucial problem in video object segmentation research. To demonstrate the superiority of our ATEN, extensive experiments are conducted on the most popular video segmentation benchmark (DAVIS) and a newly collected Video Instance-level Parsing (VIP) dataset, which is the first video instance-level human parsing dataset comprised of 404 sequences and over 20k frames with instance-level and pixel-wise annotations."
User-Guided Deep Anime Line Art Colorization with Conditional Adversarial Networks,"Scribble colors based line art colorization is a challenging computer vision problem since neither greyscale values nor semantic information is presented in line arts, and the lack of authentic illustration-line art training pairs also increases difficulty of model generalization. Recently, several Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success. They can generate colorized illustrations conditioned on given line art and color hints. However, these methods fail to capture the authentic illustration distributions and are hence perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they often lack accurate shading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep conditional adversarial architecture for scribble based anime line art colorization. Specifically, we integrate the conditional framework with WGAN-GP criteria as well as the perceptual loss to enable us to robustly train a deep network that makes the synthesized images more natural and real. We also introduce a local features network that is independent of synthetic data. With GANs conditioned on features from such network, we notably increase the generalization capability over ""in the wild"" line arts. Furthermore, we collect two datasets that provide high-quality colorful illustrations and authentic line arts for training and benchmarking. With the proposed model trained on our illustration dataset, we demonstrate that images synthesized by the presented approach are considerably more realistic and precise than alternative approaches."
BitStream: Efficient Computing Architecture for Real-Time Low-Power Inference of Binary Neural Networks on CPUs,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been widely used in many multimedia applications such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and so on. Nevertheless, the high performance of deep CNN models also comes with high consumption of computation and storage resources, making it difficult to run CNN models in real time applications on mobile devices, where computational ability, memory resource and power are largely constrained. Binary network is a recently proposed tech- nique to reduce the computational and memory complexity of CNN, in which the expensive floating-point operations can be replaced by much cheaper bit-wise operations. Despite its obvious advantages, only few works explored the efficient implementation of Binary Neural Networks (BNN). In this work, we present a general architecture for efficient binary convolution referred to as BitStream with the latest computation flow for BNNs instead of the traditional row-major im2col based one. We mainly optimize memory access during computation of BNNs, the proposed calculation flow is cache friendly as well as can largely reduce memory overhead of BNNs, decidedly leading to its memory efficiency and further computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations on various networks demon- strate the efficiency of the proposed method. For instance, memory consumption of BitStream is reduced by 18-32× than original networks and 3× than existing implementations of BNNs during inference. Moreover, our implemented binary Alexnet can achieve 8.07× and 2.84× speedup over floating point precision model and conventional implementations of BNNs on 8 × Cortex A53 CPU s. With 4 × Intel CORE i7 6700 CPUs, the binary vgg-like convolutional network on CIFAR-10 runs even 1.69× faster than floating point precision version on TitanX GPU."
Attentive Crowd Flow Machines,"Traffic flow prediction is crucial for urban traffic management and public safety. Its key challenges lie in how to adaptively integrate the various factors that affect the flow changes. In this paper, we propose a unified neural network module to address this problem, called Attentive Crowd Flow Machine~(ACFM), which is able to infer the evolution of the crowd flow by learning dynamic representations of temporally-varying data with an attention mechanism. Specifically, the ACFM is composed of two progressive ConvLSTM units connected with a convolutional layer for spatial weight prediction. The first LSTM takes the sequential flow density representation as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step for attention map inference, while the second LSTM aims at learning the effective spatial-temporal feature expression from attentionally weighted crowd flow features. Based on the ACFM, we further build a deep architecture with the application to citywide crowd flow prediction, which naturally incorporates the sequential and periodic data as well as other external influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks (i.e., crowd flow in Beijing and New York City) show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods."
Video-based Person Re-identification via Self-Paced Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework,"Person re-identification is an important task in video surveillance, focusing on finding the same person across different cameras. However, most existing methods of video-based person re-identification still have some limitations (e.g., the lack of effective deep learning framework, the robustness of the model, and the same treatment for all video frames) which make them unable to achieve better recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced learning algorithm for video-based person re-identification, which could gradually learn from simple to complex samples for a mature and stable model. Self-paced learning is employed to enhance video-based person re-identification based on deep neural network, so that deep neural network and self-paced learning are unified into one frame. Then, based on the trained self-paced learning, we propose to employ deep reinforcement learning to discard misleading and confounding frames and find the most representative frames from video pairs. With the advantage of deep reinforcement learning, our method can learn strategies to select the optimal frame groups. Experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing methods on the iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS datasets."
Interpretable Multimodal Retrieval for Fashion Products,"Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to fashion retrieval. However, the latent meaning of learned feature vectors hinders the explanation of retrieval results and integration of user feedback. Fortunately, there are many online shopping websites organizing fashion items into hierarchical structures based on product taxonomy and domain knowledge. Such structures help to reveal how human perceive the relatedness among fashion products. Nevertheless, incorporating structural knowledge for deep learning remains a challenging problem. This paper presents techniques for organizing and utilizing the fashion hierarchies in deep learning to facilitate the reasoning of search results and user intent. The novelty of our work originates from the development of an EI (Exclusive & Independent) tree that can cooperate with deep models for end-to-end multimodal learning. EI tree organizes the fashion concepts into multiple semantic levels and augments the tree structure with exclusive as well as independent constraints. It describes the different relationships among sibling concepts and guides the end-to-end learning of multi-level fashion semantics. From EI tree, we learn an explicit hierarchical similarity function to characterize the semantic similarities among fashion products. It facilitates the interpretable retrieval scheme that can integrate the concept-level feedback. Experiment results on two large fashion datasets show that the proposed approach can characterize the semantic similarities among fashion items accurately and capture user's search intent precisely, leading to more accurate search results as compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Generating Defensive Plays in Basketball Games,"In this paper, we present a method to generate realistic defensive plays in a basketball game based on the ball and the offensive team's movements. Our system allows players and coaches to simulate how the opposing team will react to a newly developed offensive strategy for evaluating its effectiveness. To achieve the aim, we train on the NBA dataset a conditional generative adversarial network that learns spatio-temporal interactions between players' movements. The network consists of two components: a generator that takes a latent noise vector and the offensive team's trajectories as input to generate defensive team's trajectories; and a discriminator that evaluates the realistic degree of the generated results. Since a basketball game can be easily identified as fake if the ball handler, who is not defended, does not shoot the ball or cut into the restricted area, we add the wide open penalty to the objective function to assist model training. To evaluate the results, we compared the similarity of the real and the generated defensive plays, in terms of the players' movement speed and acceleration, distance to defend ball handlers and non- ball handlers, and the frequency of wide open occurrences. In addition, we conducted a user study with 59 participants for subjective tests. Experimental results show the high fidelity of the generated defensive plays to real data and demonstrate the feasibility of our algorithm."
Dense Auto-Encoder Hashing for Robust Cross-Modality Retrieval,"Cross-modality retrieval has been widely studied, which aims to search images as response to text queries or vice versa. When faced with large-scale dataset, cross-modality hashing serves as an efficient and effective solution, which learns binary codes to approximate the cross-modality similarity in the Hamming space. Most recent cross-modality hashing schemes focus on learning the hash functions from data instances with fully modalities. However, how to learn robust binary codes when facing incomplete modality (i.e., with one modality missed or partially observed), is left unexploited, which however widely occurs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality hashing, termed Dense Auto-encoder Hashing (DAH), which can explicitly impute the missed modality and produce robust binary codes by leveraging the relatedness among different modalities. To that effect, we propose a novel Dense Auto-encoder Network (DAN) to impute the missing modalities, which densely connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. For each layer, a noisy auto-encoder block is designed to calculate the residue between the current prediction and original data. Finally, a hash-layer is added to the end of DAN, which serves as a special binary encoder model to deal with the incomplete modality input. Quantitative experiments on three cross-modality visual search benchmarks, i.e., the Wiki, NUS-WIDE, and FLICKR-25K, have shown that the proposed DAH has superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches."
Dance with Melody: An LSTM-autoencoder Approach to Music-oriented Dance Synthesis,"Dance is greatly influenced by music. Studies on how to synthesize music-oriented dance choreography can promote research in many fields, such as dance teaching and human behavior research. Although considerable effort has been directed toward investigating the relationship between music and dance, the synthesis of appropriate dance choreography based on music remains an open problem. There are two main challenges: 1) how to choose appropriate dance figures, i.e., groups of steps that are named and specified in technical dance manuals, in accordance with music and 2) how to artistically enhance choreography in accordance with music. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a music-oriented dance choreography synthesis method using a long short-term memory (LSTM)-autoencoder model to extract a mapping between acoustic and motion features. Moreover, we improve our model with temporal indexes and a masking method to achieve better performance. Because of the lack of data available for model training, we constructed a music-dance dataset containing choreographies for four types of dance, totaling 907,200 frames of 3D dance motions and accompanying music, and extracted multidimensional features for model training. We employed this dataset to train and optimize the proposed models and conducted several qualitative and quantitative experiments to select the best-fitted model. Finally, our model proved to be effective and efficient in synthesizing valid choreographies that are also capable of musical expression."
Musicality-Novelty Generative Adversarial Nets for Algorithmic Composition,"Algorithmic composition, which enables computer to generate music like human composers, has lasting charm because it intends to approximate artistic creation, most mysterious part of human intelligence. To deliver both melodious and refreshing music, this paper proposes the Musicality-Novelty Generative Adversarial Nets for algorithmic composition. With the same generator, two adversarial nets alternately optimize the musicality and novelty of the machine-composed music. A new model called novelty game is presented to maximize the minimal distance between the machine-composed music sample and any human-composed music sample in the novelty space, where all well-known human composed music products are far from each other. We implement the proposed framework using three supervised CNNs with one for generator, one for musicality critic and one for novelty critic on the time-pitch feature space. Specifically, the novelty critic is implemented by Siamese neural networks with temporal alignment using dynamic time warping. We provide empirical validations by generating the music samples under various scenarios."
Improving QoE of ABR Streaming Sessions through QUIC Retransmissions,"While adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming has contributed significantly to the reduction of video playout stalling, ABR clients continue to suffer from the variation of bit rate qualities over the duration of a streaming session. Similar to stalling, these variations in bit rate quality have a negative impact on the users' Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we use a trace from a large-scale CDN to show that such quality changes occur in a significant amount of streaming sessions and investigate an ABR video segment retransmission approach to reduce the number of such quality changes. As the new HTTP/2 standard is becoming increasingly popular, we also see an increase in the usage of QUIC as an alternative protocol for the transmission of web traffic including video streaming. Using various network conditions, we conduct a systematic comparison of existing transport layer approaches for HTTP/2 that is best suited for ABR segment retransmissions. Since it is well known that both protocols provide a series of improvements over HTTP/1.1, we perform experiments both in controlled environments and over transcontinental links in the Internet and find that these benefits also ""trickle up'' into the application layer when it comes to ABR video streaming where QUIC retransmissions can significantly improve the average quality bitrate while simultaneously minimizing bit rate variations over the duration of a streaming session."
"From Data to Knowledge: Deep Learning Model Compression, Transmission and Communication","With the advances of artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed a gradual transition from the big data to the big knowledge. Based on the knowledge-powered deep learning models, the big data such as the vast text, images and videos can be efficiently analyzed. As such, in addition to data, the communication of knowledge implied in the deep learning models is also strongly desired. As a specific example regarding the concept of knowledge creation and communication in the context of Knowledge Centric Networking (KCN), we investigate the deep learning model compression and demonstrate its promise use through a set of experiments. In particular, towards future KCN, we introduce efficient transmission of deep learning models in terms of both single model compression and multiple model prediction. The necessity, importance and open problems regarding the standardization of deep learning models, which enables the interoperability with the standardized compact model representation bitstream syntax, are also discussed."

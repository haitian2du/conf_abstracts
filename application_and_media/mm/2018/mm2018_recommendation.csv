What Dress Fits Me Best?: Fashion Recommendation on the Clothing Style for Personal Body Shape,"Clothing is an integral part of life. Also, it is always an uneasy task for people to make decisions on what to wear. An essential style tip is to dress for the body shape, i.e., knowing one's own body shape (e.g., hourglass, rectangle, round and inverted triangle) and selecting the types of clothes that will accentuate the body's good features. In the literature, although various fashion recommendation systems for clothing items have been developed, none of them had explicitly taken the user's basic body shape into consideration. In this paper, therefore, we proposed a first framework for learning the compatibility of clothing styles and body shapes from social big data, with the goal to recommend a user about what to wear better in relation to his/her essential body attributes. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach, leading to a new aspect for research into fashion recommendation."
CSAN: Contextual Self-Attention Network for User Sequential Recommendation,"The sequential recommendation is an important task for online user-oriented services, such as purchasing products, watching videos, and social media consumption. Recent work usually used RNN-based methods to derive an overall embedding of the whole behavior sequence, which fails to discriminate the significance of individual user behaviors and thus decreases the recommendation performance. Besides, RNN-based encoding has fixed size and makes further recommendation application inefficient and inflexible. The online sequential behaviors of a user are generally heterogeneous, polysemous, and dynamically context-dependent. In this paper, we propose a unified Contextual Self-Attention Network (CSAN) to address the three properties. Heterogeneous user behaviors are considered in our model that are projected into a common latent semantic space. Then the output is fed into the feature-wise self-attention network to capture the polysemy of user behaviors. In addition, the forward and backward position encoding matrices are proposed to model dynamic contextual dependency. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms."
Attentive Interactive Convolutional Matching for Community Question Answering in Social Multimedia,"Nowadays, community-based question answering (CQA) services have accumulated millions of users to share valuable knowledge. An essential function in CQA tasks is the accurate matching of answers w.r.t given questions. Existing methods usually ignore the redundant, heterogeneous, and multi-modal properties of CQA systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal attentive interactive convolutional matching method (MMAICM) to model the multi-modal content and social context jointly for questions and answers in a unified framework for CQA retrieval, which explores the redundant, heterogeneous, and multi-modal properties of CQA systems jointly. A well-designed attention mechanism is proposed to focus on useful word-pair interactions and neglect meaningless and noisy word-pair interactions. Moreover, a multi-modal interaction matrix method and a novel meta-path based network representation approach are proposed to consider the multi-modal content and social context, respectively. The attentive interactive convolutional matching network is proposed to infer the relevance between questions and answers, which can capture both the lexical and the sequential information of the contents. Experiment results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MMAICM compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms."
Beyond the Product: Discovering Image Posts for Brands in Social Media,"Brands and organizations are using social networks such as Instagram to share image or video posts regularly, in order to engage and maximize their presence to the users. Differently from the traditional advertising paradigm, these posts feature not only specific products, but also the value and philosophy of the brand, known as brand associations in marketing literature. In fact, marketers are spending considerable resources to generate their content in-house, and increasingly often, to discover and repost the content generated by users. However, to choose the right posts for a brand in social media remains an open problem. Driven by this real-life application, we define the new task of content discovery for brands, which aims to discover posts that match the marketing value and brand associations of a target brand. We identify two main challenges in this new task: high inter-brand similarity and brand-post sparsity; and propose a tailored content-based learning-to-rank system to discover content for a target brand. Specifically, our method learns fine-grained brand representation via explicit modeling of brand associations, which can be interpreted as visual words shared among brands. We collected a new large-scale Instagram dataset, consisting of more than 1.1 million image and video posts from the history of 927 brands of fourteen verticals such as food and fashion. Extensive experiments indicate that our model can effectively learn fine-grained brand representations and outperform the closest state-of-the-art solutions."

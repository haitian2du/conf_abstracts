Mining Semantics-Preserving Attention for Group Activity Recognition,"In this paper, we propose a Semantics-Preserving Teacher-Student (SPTS) model for group activity recognition in videos, which aims to mine the semantics-preserving attention to automatically seek the key people and discard the misleading people. Conventional methods usually aggregate the features extracted from individual persons by pooling operations, which cannot fully explore the contextual information for group activity recognition. To address this, our SPTS networks first learn a Teacher Network in semantic domain, which classifies the word of group activity based on the words of individual actions. Then we carefully design a Student Network in vision domain, which recognizes the group activity according to the input videos, and enforce the Student Network to mimic the Teacher Network during the learning process. In this way, we allocate semantics-preserving attention to different people, which adequately explores the contextual information of different people and requires no extra labelled data. Experimental results on two widely used benchmarks for group activity recognition clearly show the superior performance of our method in comparisons with the state-of-the-arts."
Participation-Contributed Temporal Dynamic Model for Group Activity Recognition,"Group activity recognition, a challenging task that a number of individuals occur in the scene of activity while only a small subset of them participate in, has received increasing attentions. However, most of the previous methods model all the individuals' actions equivalently while ignoring a fact that not all of them are contributed to the discrimination of group activity. That is to say, only a small number of key actors (participants) play important roles in the whole group activity. Inspired by this, we explore a new ""One to Key"" idea to progressively aggregate temporal dynamics of key actors with different participation degrees over time from each person. Here, we focus on two types of key actors in the whole activity, who steadily move in the whole process (long moving time) or intensely move (but closely related to the group activity) at a significant moment. Based on this, we propose a novel Participation-Contributed Temporal Dynamic Model (PC-TDM) to recognize group activity, which mainly consists of a ""One"" network and a ""One to Key"" network. Specifically, ""One"" network aims at modeling the individual dynamic of each person. ""One to Key"" network feeds the outputs from the ""One"" network into a Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) according to the order of individual's moving time. Subsequently, each output state of Bi-LSTM weighted by a trainable time-varying attention factor is aggregated by going through LSTM one-by-one. Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method improves group activity recognition performance compared to the state-of-the-arts."
WildFish: A Large Benchmark for Fish Recognition in the Wild,"Fish recognition is an important task to understand the marine ecosystem and biodiversity. It is often challenging to identify fish species in the wild, due to the following difficulties. First, most fish benchmarks are small-scale, which may limit the representation power of machine learning models. Second, the number of fish species is huge, and there may still exist unknown categories in our planet. The traditional classifiers often fail to deal with this open-set scenario. Third, certain fish species are highly-confused. It is often hard to figure out the subtle differences, only by the unconstrained images. Motivated by these facts, we introduce a large-scale WildFish benchmark for fish recognition in the wild. Specifically, we make three contributions in this paper. First, WildFish is the largest image data set for wild fish recognition, to our best knowledge. It consists of 1000 fish categories with 54,459 unconstrained images, allowing to train high-capacity models for automatic fish classification. Second, we propose a novel open-set fish classification task for realistic scenarios, and investigate the open-set deep learning framework with a number of practical designs. Third, we propose a novel fine-grained recognition task, with the guidance of pairwise textual descriptions. Via leveraging the comparison knowledge in the sentence, we design a multi-modal fish net to effectively distinguish two confused categories in a pair. Finally, we release WildFish (https://github.com/PeiqinZhuang/WildFish), in order to bring benefit to more research studies in multimedia and beyond."
PVNet: A Joint Convolutional Network of Point Cloud and Multi-View for 3D Shape Recognition,"3D object recognition has attracted wide research attention in the field of multimedia and computer vision. With the recent proliferation of deep learning, various deep models with different representations have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Among them, point cloud and multi-view based 3D shape representations are promising recently, and their corresponding deep models have shown significant performance on 3D shape recognition. However, there is little effort concentrating point cloud data and multi-view data for 3D shape representation, which is, in our consideration, beneficial and compensated to each other. In this paper, we propose the Point-View Network (PVNet), the first framework integrating both the point cloud and the multi-view data towards joint 3D shape recognition. More specifically, an embedding attention fusion scheme is proposed that could employ high-level features from the multi-view data to model the intrinsic correlation and discriminability of different structure features from the point cloud data. In particular, the discriminative descriptions are quantified and leveraged as the soft attention mask to further refine the structure feature of the 3D shape. We have evaluated the proposed method on the ModelNet40 dataset for 3D shape classification and retrieval tasks. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our framework can achieve superior performance."

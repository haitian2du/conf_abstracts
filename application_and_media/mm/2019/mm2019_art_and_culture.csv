Recognizing the Style of Visual Arts via Adaptive Cross-layer Correlation,"Visual arts consist of various art forms, \eg painting, sculpture, architecture,~\etc, which not only enrich our lives but also involve works related to aesthetics, history, and culture. Different eras have different artistic appeals, and the art also has characteristics of each era in terms of expression and spiritual pursuit, in which style is an important attribute to describe visual arts. In order to recognize the style of visual arts more effectively, we present an end-to-end trainable architecture to learn a deep style representation. The main component of our architecture, adaptive cross-layer correlation, is inspired by the Gram matrix based correlation calculation. Our proposed method can adaptively weight features in different spatial locations based on their intrinsic similarity. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods."
Melody Slot Machine: A Controllable Holographic Virtual Performer,"This paper describes the ""Melody Slot Machine,"" an interactive music system that enables control over virtual performers. Conventional virtual players focus on what kind of output performance is given to the input performance, and the performance output is difficult to control. The Melody Slot Machine enables the user to select the melody to be played next by the virtual player by rotating a dial. Furthermore, the performer is projected on a holographic display, and the user can feel as if a real virtual player is there. To achieve this, the system needs to change the melody and the performance video."
Generating Captions for Images of Ancient Artworks,"The neural encoder-decoder framework is widely adopted for image captioning of natural images. However, few works have contributed to generating captions for cultural images using this scheme. In this paper, we propose an artwork type enriched image captioning model where the encoder represents an input artwork image as a 512-dimensional vector and the decoder generates a corresponding caption based on the input image vector. The artwork type is first predicted by a convolutional neural network classifier and then merged into the decoder. We investigate multiple approaches to integrate the artwork type into the captioning model among which is one that applies a step-wise weighted sum of the artwork type vector and the hidden representation vector of the decoder. This model outperforms three baseline image captioning models for a Chinese art image captioning dataset on all evaluation metrics. One of the baselines is a state-of-the-art approach fusing textual image attributes into the captioning model for natural images. The proposed model also obtains promising results for another Egyptian art image captioning dataset."
GP-GAN: Towards Realistic High-Resolution Image Blending,"It is common but challenging to address high-resolution image blending in the automatic photo editing application. In this paper, we would like to focus on solving the problem of high-resolution image blending, where the composite images are provided. We propose a framework called Gaussian-Poisson Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN) to leverage the strengths of the classical gradient-based approach and Generative Adversarial Networks. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first work that explores the capability of GANs in high-resolution image blending task. Concretely, we propose Gaussian-Poisson Equation to formulate the high-resolution image blending problem, which is a joint optimization constrained by the gradient and color information. Inspired by the prior works, we obtain gradient information via applying gradient filters. To generate the color information, we propose a Blending GAN to learn the mapping between the composite images and the well-blended ones. Compared to the alternative methods, our approach can deliver high-resolution, realistic images with fewer bleedings and unpleasant artifacts. Experiments confirm that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Transient Attributes dataset. A user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk finds that the majority of workers are in favor of the proposed method. The source code is available in \urlhttps://github.com/wuhuikai/GP-GAN, and there's also an online demo in \urlhttp://wuhuikai.me/DeepJS."
Progressive Image Inpainting with Full-Resolution Residual Network,"Recently, learning-based algorithms for image inpainting achieve remarkable progress dealing with squared or irregular holes. However, they fail to generate plausible textures inside damaged area because there lacks surrounding information. A progressive inpainting approach would be advantageous for eliminating central blurriness, i.e., restoring well and then updating masks. In this paper, we propose full-resolution residual network (FRRN) to fill irregular holes, which is proved to be effective for progressive image inpainting. We show that well-designed residual architecture facilitates feature integration and texture prediction. Additionally, to guarantee completion quality during progressive inpainting, we adopt N Blocks, One Dilation strategy, which assigns several residual blocks for one dilation step. Correspondingly, a step loss function is applied to improve the performance of intermediate restorations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FRRN framework for image inpainting is much better than previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively."
Facial Image-to-Video Translation by a Hidden Affine Transformation,"There has been a prominent emergence of work on video prediction, aiming to extrapolate the future video frames from the past. Existing temporal-based methods are limited to certain numbers of frames. In this paper, we study video prediction from a single still image in the facial expression domain, a.k.a, facial image-to-video translation. Our main approach, dubbed AffineGAN, associates each facial image with an expression intensity and leverages an affine transformation in the latent space. AffineGAN allows users to control the number of frames to predict as well as the expression intensity for each of them. Unlike previous intensity-based methods, We derive an inverse formulation to the affine transformation, enabling automatic inference of the facial expression intensities from videos --- manual annotation is not only tedious but also ambiguous as people express in various ways and have different opinions about the intensity of a facial image. Both quantitative and qualitative results verify the superiority of AffineGAN over the state of the arts. Notably, in a Turing test with web faces, more than 50% of the facial expression videos generated by AffineGAN are considered real by the Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. This work could improve users' communication experience by enabling them to conveniently and creatively produce expression GIFs, which are popular art forms in online messaging and social networks."

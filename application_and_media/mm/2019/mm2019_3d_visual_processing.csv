3D Point Cloud Geometry Compression on Deep Learning,"3D point cloud presentation has been widely used in computer vision, automatic driving, augmented reality, smart cities and virtual reality. 3D point cloud compression method with higher compression ratio and tiny loss is the key to improve data transportation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new 3D point cloud geometry compression method based on deep learning, also an auto-encoder performing better than other networks in detail reconstruction. It can reach much higher compression ratio than the state-of-art while keeping tolerable loss. It also supports parallel compressing multiple models by GPU, which can improve processing efficiency greatly. The compression process is composed of two parts. Firstly, Raw data is compressed into codeword by extracting feature of raw model with encoder. Then, the codeword is further compressed with sparse coding. Decompression process is implemented in reverse order. Codeword is recovered and fed into decoder to reconstruct point cloud. Detail reconstruction ability is improved by a hierarchical structure in our decoder. Latter outputs are grown from former fuzzier outputs. In this way, details are added to former output by latter layers step by step to make a more precise prediction. We compare our method with PCL compression and Draco compression on ShapeNet40 part dataset. Our method may be the first deep learning-based point cloud compression algorithm. The experiments demonstrate it is superior to former common compression algorithms with large compression ratio, which can also reserve original shapes with tiny loss."
Eye in the Sky: Drone-Based Object Tracking and 3D Localization,"Drones, or general UAVs, equipped with a single camera have been widely deployed to a broad range of applications, such as aerial photography, fast goods delivery and most importantly, surveillance. Despite the great progress achieved in computer vision algorithms, these algorithms are not usually optimized for dealing with images or video sequences acquired by drones, due to various challenges such as occlusion, fast camera motion and pose variation. In this paper, a drone-based multi-object tracking and 3D localization scheme is proposed based on the deep learning based object detection. We first combine a multi-object tracking method called TrackletNet Tracker (TNT) which utilizes temporal and appearance information to track detected objects located on the ground for UAV applications. Then, we are also able to localize the tracked ground objects based on the group plane estimated from the Multi-View Stereo technique. The system deployed on the drone can not only detect and track the objects in a scene, but can also localize their 3D coordinates in meters with respect to the drone camera. The experiments have proved our tracker can reliably handle most of the detected objects captured by drones and achieve favorable 3D localization performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
MMJN: Multi-Modal Joint Networks for 3D Shape Recognition,"3D shape recognition has attracted wide research attention in the field of multimedia and computer vision. With the recent advance of deep learning, various deep models with different representations have achieved the state-of-the-art performances. Among them, many modalities are proposed to represent 3D model, such as point cloud, multi-view, and PANORAMA-view. Based on these representations, many corresponding deep models have shown significant performances on 3D shape recognition. However, few work to considers utilizing the fusion information of multi-modal for 3D shape recognition. Since these different modalities represent the same 3D model, they should guide each other to get a better feature representation. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal joint network (MMJN) for 3D shape recognition, which can consider the correlation between two different modalities to extract the robust feature vector. More specifically, we propose a novel correlation loss which can utilize the correlation between different features extracted by different modality networks to increase the robustness of the feature representation. Finally, we utilize the late fusion method to fuse the multi-modal information for 3D model representation and recognition. Here, we define the weight of different modalities features based on the statistic method and utilize the advantages of different modalities to generate more robust feature. We evaluated the proposed method on the ModelNet40 dataset for 3D shape classification and retrieval tasks. Experimental results and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach."
Monocular Visual Object 3D Localization in Road Scenes,"3D localization of objects in road scenes is important for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). However, with common monocular camera setups, 3D information is difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust method for 3D localization of monocular visual objects in road scenes by joint integration of depth estimation, ground plane estimation, and multi-object tracking techniques. Firstly, an object depth estimation method with depth confidence is proposed by utilizing the monocular depthmap from a CNN. Secondly, an adaptive ground plane estimation using both dense and sparse features is proposed to localize the objects when their depth estimation is not reliable. Thirdly, temporal information is taken into consideration by a new object tracklet smoothing method. Unlike most existing methods which only consider vehicle localization, our method is applicable for common moving objects in the road scenes, including pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists, etc. Moreover, the input depthmap can be replaced by some equivalent depth information from other sensors, like LiDAR, depth camera and Radar, which makes our system much more competitive compared with other object localization methods. As evaluated on KITTI dataset, our method achieves favorable performance on 3D localization of both pedestrians and vehicles when compared with the state-of-the-art vehicle localization methods, though no published performance on pedestrian 3D localization can be compared with, from the best of our knowledge."
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Training an accurate 3D human pose estimator often requires a large amount of 3D ground-truth data which is inefficient and costly to collect. Previous methods have either resorted to weakly supervised methods to reduce the demand of ground-truth data for training, or using synthetically-generated but photo-realistic samples to enlarge the training data pool. Nevertheless, the former methods mainly require either additional supervision, such as unpaired 3D ground-truth data, or the camera parameters in multiview settings. On the other hand, the latter methods require accurately textured models, illumination configurations and background which need careful engineering. To address these problems, we propose a domain adaptation framework with unsupervised knowledge transfer, which aims at leveraging the knowledge in multi-modality data of the easy-to-get synthetic depth datasets to better train a pose estimator on the real-world datasets. Specifically, the framework first trains two pose estimators on synthetically-generated depth images and human body segmentation masks with full supervision, while jointly learning a human body segmentation module from the predicted 2D poses. Subsequently, the learned pose estimator and the segmentation module are applied to the real-world dataset to unsupervisedly learn a new RGB image based 2D/3D human pose estimator. Here, the knowledge encoded in the supervised learning modules are used to regularize a pose estimator without ground-truth annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over weakly supervised methods when no ground-truth annotations are available. Further experiments with ground-truth annotations show that the proposed framework can outperform state-of-the-art fully supervised methods. In addition, we conducted ablation studies to examine the impact of each loss term, as well as with different amount of supervisions signal."
DaNet: Decompose-and-aggregate Network for 3D Human Shape and Pose Estimation,"Reconstructing 3D human shape and pose from a monocular image is challenging despite the promising results achieved by most recent learning based methods. The commonly occurred misalignment comes from the facts that the mapping from image to model space is highly non-linear and the rotation-based pose representation of the body model is prone to result in drift of joint positions. In this work, we present the Decompose-and-aggregate Network (DaNet) to address these issues. DaNet includes three new designs, namely UVI guided learning, decomposition for fine-grained perception, and aggregation for robust prediction. First, we adopt the UVI maps, which densely build a bridge between 2D pixels and 3D vertexes, as an intermediate representation to facilitate the learning of image-to-model mapping. Second, we decompose the prediction task into one global stream and multiple local streams so that the network not only provides global perception for the camera and shape prediction, but also has detailed perception for part pose prediction. Lastly, we aggregate the message from local streams to enhance the robustness of part pose prediction, where a position-aided rotation feature refinement strategy is proposed to exploit the spatial relationship between body parts. Such a refinement strategy is more efficient since the correlations between position features are stronger than that in the original rotation feature space. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the Human3.6M and UP-3D datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the reconstruction performance in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HongwenZhang/DaNet-3DHumanReconstrution ."
"3D Singing Head for Music VR: Learning External and Internal Articulatory Synchronicity from Lyric, Audio and Notes","We propose a real-time 3D singing head system to enhance the talking head on model integrity, keyframe generation and song synchronicity. The individual head appearance meshes are first obtained by matching multi-view visible images with face prior for accuracy, and then used to reconstruct entire head model by integrating with generic internal articulatory meshes for efficiency. After embedding physiology, the keyframes of each phoneme-music note correspondence are substantially synthesized from real articulation data. The song synchronicity of articulators is learned using a deep neural network to train visual co-articulation model (VCM) on parallel audio-visual data. Finally, the keyframes of adjacent phoneme-music note correspondences are blended by VCM to produce song synchronized animation. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our system can not only clearly distinguish phonemes and notes, but also significantly reduce the dependence on training data."
Fine-grained Fitting Experience Prediction: A 3D-slicing Attention Approach,"The comfortableness of fashion items (e.g., footwear) when people actually wear them has become an increasingly important factor in today's fashion experience. However, existing solutions usually only provide general metrics, e.g., a size of a pair of shoes, for people to roughly infer the fitness possibility, failing to tell the details about how much it fits or why it does not fit a person. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained fitting experience prediction framework based on 3D shapes of both fashion items and people's bodies. First, we propose a 3D-slicing sampling method, by extracting a series of parallel slices from an object, to represent the spatial details of the object with a much smaller amount of features. Second, we propose a spatial self-attention based fitness prediction model including a sub-region attention method and a sequence attention method, which can capture users' comfortable preferences for fine-grained regions divided from slices. Our design can capture users' try-on preferences and landmark positions that may or may not fit (e.g., too tight or too loose). Then, we design a multi-position experience module to predict users' fitting experiences, which can help to explore the spatial differences among slices better. Finally, we use subjective experiments over 500 people trying 32 pairs of fashion shoes with detailed places' comfortableness reported in questionnaires to verify our design, which has accuracies of $77.7%$ and $80.9%$ in reporting the comfortableness of tightness and length respectively, and an overall fitness accuracy of $83.6%$."
iDFusion: Globally Consistent Dense 3D Reconstruction from RGB-D and Inertial Measurements,"We present a practical fast, globally consistent and robust dense 3D reconstruction system, iDFusion, by exploring the joint benefit of both the visual (RGB-D) solution and inertial measurement unit (IMU). A global optimization considering all the previous states is adopted to maintain high localization accuracy and global consistency, yet its complexity of being linear to the number of all previous camera/IMU observations seriously impedes real-time implementation. We show that the global optimization can be solved efficiently at the complexity linear to the number of keyframes, and further realize a real-time dense 3D reconstruction system given the estimated camera states. Meanwhile, for the sake of robustness, we propose a novel loop-validity detector based on the estimated bias of the IMU state. By checking the consistency of camera movements, a false loop closure constraint introduces manifest inconsistency between the camera movements and IMU measurements. Experiments reveal that iDFusion owns superior reconstruction performance running in 25 fps on CPU computing of portable devices, under challenging yet practical scenarios including texture-less, motion blur, and repetitive contents."
Ground-Aware Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving,"Semantic understanding of 3D scenes is essential for autonomous driving. Although a number of efforts have been devoted to semantic segmentation of dense point clouds, the great sparsity of 3D LiDAR data poses significant challenges in autonomous driving. In this paper, we work on the semantic segmentation problem of extremely sparse LiDAR point clouds with specific consideration of the ground as reference. In particular, we propose a ground-aware framework that well solves the ambiguity caused by data sparsity. We employ a multi-section plane fitting approach to roughly extract ground points to assist segmentation of objects on the ground. Based on the roughly extracted ground points, our approach implicitly integrates the ground information in a weakly-supervised manner and utilizes ground-aware features with a new ground-aware attention module. The proposed ground-aware attention module captures long-range dependence between ground and objects, which significantly facilitates the segmentation of small objects that only consist of a few points in extremely sparse point clouds. Extensive experiments on two large-scale LiDAR point cloud datasets for autonomous driving demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively."
SRINet: Learning Strictly Rotation-Invariant Representations for Point Cloud Classification and Segmentation,"Point cloud analysis has drawn broader attentions due to its increasing demands in various fields. Despite the impressive performance has been achieved on several databases, researchers neglect the fact that the orientation of those point cloud data is aligned. Varying the orientation of point cloud may lead to the degradation of performance, restricting the capacity of generalizing to real applications where the prior of orientation is often unknown. In this paper, we propose the point projection feature, which is invariant to the rotation of the input point cloud. A novel architecture is designed to mine features of different levels. We adopt a PointNet-based backbone to extract global feature for point cloud, and the graph aggregation operation to perceive local shape structure. Besides, we introduce an efficient key point descriptor to assign each point with different response and help recognize the overall geometry. Mathematical analyses and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract strictly rotation-invariant representations for point cloud recognition and segmentation without data augmentation, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods."
L2G Auto-encoder: Understanding Point Clouds by Local-to-Global Reconstruction with Hierarchical Self-Attention,"Auto-encoder is an important architecture to understand point clouds in an encoding and decoding procedure of self reconstruction. Current auto-encoder mainly focuses on the learning of global structure by global shape reconstruction, while ignoring the learning of local structures. To resolve this issue, we propose Local-to-Global auto-encoder (L2G-AE) to simultaneously learn the local and global structure of point clouds by local to global reconstruction. Specifically, L2G-AE employs an encoder to encode the geometry information of multiple scales in a local region at the same time. In addition, we introduce a novel hierarchical self-attention mechanism to highlight the important points, scales and regions at different levels in the information aggregation of the encoder. Simultaneously, L2G-AE employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) as decoder to reconstruct a sequence of scales in a local region, based on which the global point cloud is incrementally reconstructed. Our outperforming results in shape classification, retrieval and upsampling show that L2G-AE can understand point clouds better than state-of-the-art methods."
Self-supervised Representation Learning Using 360° Data,"The amount of 360-degree panoramas shared online has been rapidly increasing due to the availability of affordable and compact omnidirectional cameras, which offers huge amount of new information unavailable before. In this paper, we present the first work to exploit unlabeled 360-degree data for image representation learning. We propose middle-out, a new self-supervised learning task, which leverages the spatial configuration of normal field-of-view images sampled from a 360-degree image as supervisory signal. We train a Siamese ConvNet model to identify the middle image among three shuffled images sampled from a panorama by perspective projection. Compared to previous self-supervised methods that train models using image patches or video frames with limited field-of-view, our method leverages the rich semantic information contained in 360-degree images and enforces the model to not only learn about objects, but also develop a higher-level understanding about object relationships and scene structures. We quantitatively demonstrate that the feature representation learned using the proposed task is useful for a wide range of vision tasks including object classification, object detection, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and geometry estimation. We also qualitatively show that the proposed method can enforce the ConvNet to extract high-level semantic concepts, an ability which previous self-supervised learning methods have not acquired."
360-degree Video Gaze Behaviour: A Ground-Truth Data Set and a Classification Algorithm for Eye Movements,"Eye tracking and the analysis of gaze behaviour are established tools to produce insights into how humans observe their surroundings and consume visual multimedia content. For example, gaze recordings may be directly used to study attention allocation towards the areas and objects of interest. Furthermore, segmenting the raw gaze traces into their constituent eye movements has applications in the assessment of subjective quality and mental load, and may improve computational saliency prediction of the content as well. Currently, eye trackers are beginning to be integrated into commodity virtual and augmented reality set-ups that allow for more diverse stimuli to be presented, including 360-degree content. However, because of the more complex eye-head coordination patterns that emerge, the definitions and the well-established methods that were developed for monitor-based eye tracking are often no longer directly applicable. The main contributions of this work to the field of 360-degree content analysis are threefold: First, we collect and partially annotate a new eye tracking data set for naturalistic 360-degree videos. Second, we propose a new two-stage pipeline for reliable manual annotation of both ""traditional"" (fixations and saccades) and more complex eye movement types that is implemented in a flexible user interface. Lastly, we develop and test a proof-of-concept algorithm for automatic classification of all the eye movement types in our data set. The data set and the source code for both the annotation tool and the algorithm are publicly available at https://gin.g-node.org/ioannis.agtzidis/360_em_dataset."

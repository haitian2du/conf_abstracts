Aligning Linguistic Words and Visual Semantic Units for Image Captioning,"Image captioning attempts to generate a sentence composed of several linguistic words, which are used to describe objects, attributes, and interactions in an image, denoted as visual semantic units in this paper. Based on this view, we propose to explicitly model the object interactions in semantics and geometry based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and fully exploit the alignment between linguistic words and visual semantic units for image captioning. Particularly, we construct a semantic graph and a geometry graph, where each node corresponds to a visual semantic unit, i.e., an object, an attribute, or a semantic (geometrical) interaction between two objects. Accordingly, the semantic (geometrical) context-aware embeddings for each unit are obtained through the corresponding GCN learning processers. At each time step, a context gated attention module takes as inputs the embeddings of the visual semantic units and hierarchically align the current word with these units by first deciding which type of visual semantic unit (object, attribute, or interaction) the current word is about, and then finding the most correlated visual semantic units under this type. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning dataset, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches."
Hierarchical Global-Local Temporal Modeling for Video Captioning,"In this paper, a Hierarchical Temporal Model (HTM) is proposed for the video captioning task, based on exploring the global and local temporal structure to better recognize fine-grained objects and actions. In our HTM, the encoder and decoder are hierarchically aligned according to different levels of features. The encoder applies two LSTM layers to construct temporal structures at both frame-level and object-level where the attention mechanism is applied to locate objects of interest, and the decoder uses corresponding LSTM layers to extract pivotal features from global to local through multi-level attention mechanism. Moreover, the local temporal structure is constructed implicitly from candidate object-oriented features under the guidance of global temporal-spatial representation, that could generate more accurate descriptions in handling shot-switching problems. Experiments on the widely used Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD) and Charades datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach when compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Unpaired Cross-lingual Image Caption Generation with Self-Supervised Rewards,"Generating image descriptions in different languages is essential to satisfy users worldwide. However, it is prohibitively expensive to collect large-scale paired image-caption dataset for every target language which is critical for training descent image captioning models. Previous works tackle the unpaired cross-lingual image captioning problem through a pivot language, which is with the help of paired image-caption data in the pivot language and pivot-to-target machine translation models. However, such language-pivoted approach suffers from inaccuracy brought by the pivot-to-target translation, including disfluency and visual irrelevancy errors. In this paper, we propose to generate cross-lingual image captions with self-supervised rewards in the reinforcement learning framework to alleviate these two types of errors. We employ self-supervision from mono-lingual corpus in the target language to provide fluency reward, and propose a multi-level visual semantic matching model to provide both sentence-level and concept-level visual relevancy rewards. We conduct extensive experiments for unpaired cross-lingual image captioning in both English and Chinese respectively on two widely used image caption corpora. The proposed approach achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods."
MUCH: Mutual Coupling Enhancement of Scene Recognition and Dense Captioning,"Due to the abstraction of scenes, comprehensive scene understanding requires semantic modeling in both global and local aspects. Scene recognition is usually researched from a global point of view, while dense captioning is typically studied for local regions. Previous works separately research on the modeling of scene recognition and dense captioning. In contrast, we propose a joint learning framework that benefits from the mutual coupling of scene recognition and dense captioning models. Generally, these two tasks are coupled through two steps, 1) fusing the supervision by considering the contexts between scene labels and local captions, and 2) jointly optimizing semantically symmetric LSTM models. Particularly, in order to balance bias between dense captioning and scene recognition, a scene adaptive non-maximum suppression (NMS) method is proposed to emphasize the scene related regions in region proposal procedure, and a region-wise and category-wise weighted pooling method is proposed to avoid over attention on particular regions in local to global pooling procedure. For the model training and evaluation, scene labels are manually annotated for Visual Genome database. The experimental results on Visual Genome show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method also can improve previous CNN based works on public scene databases, such as MIT67 and SUN397."
Attention-based Densely Connected LSTM for Video Captioning,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), have been widely used for video captioning, since they can cope with the temporal dependencies within both video frames and the corresponding descriptions. However, as the sequence gets longer, it becomes much harder to handle the temporal dependencies within the sequence. And in traditional LSTM, previously generated hidden states except the last one do not work directly to predict the current word. This may lead to the predicted word highly related to the last generated hidden state other than the overall context. To better capture long range dependencies and directly leverage early generated hidden states, in this work, we propose a novel model named Attention-based Densely Connected Long Short-Term Memory (DenseLSTM). In DenseLSTM, to ensure maximum information flow, all previous cells are connected to the current cell, which makes the updating of the current state directly related to all its previous states. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is designed to model the impacts of different hidden states. Because each cell is directly connected with all its successive cells, each cell has direct access to the gradients from later ones. In this way, the long-range dependencies are more effectively captured. We perform experiments on two publicly used video captioning datasets: the Microsoft Video Description Corpus (MSVD) and the MSR-VTT, and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of DenseLSTM."
Critic-based Attention Network for Event-based Video Captioning,"In this paper, we investigate utilizing an actor-critic architecture for an event-based video captioning. In this captioning task, the video can contain multiple overlapping events. We consider the words as the actions that our model takes sequentially. The architecture of our model consists of an actor network to predict the captions given temporal segments in a video and a critic network to measure the quality of the generated captions. Our model, first, localizes events in the video, then by using the localized events, it locates temporal segments in the video. We adopt a global network to generate a caption for each temporal segment. We propose an attention mechanism to account for the importance of each localized event in captioning a temporal segment in the video. We provide a set of experiments on utilizing our method in the task of event-based video captioning on ActivityNet Captions and TACoS-MultiLevel datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art video captioning methods."
Watch It Twice: Video Captioning with a Refocused Video Encoder,"With the rapid growth of video data and the increasing demands of various crossmodal applications such as intelligent video search and assistance towards visually-impaired people, video captioning task has received a lot of attention recently in computer vision and natural language processing fields. The state-of-the-art video captioning methods focus more on encoding the temporal information, while lacking effective ways to remove irrelevant temporal information and also neglecting the spatial details. In particular, the current unidirectional video encoder can be negatively affected by irrelevant temporal information, especially the irrelevant information at the beginning and at the end of a video. In addition, disregarding detailed spatial features may lead to incorrect word choices in decoding. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent video encoding method and a novel visual spatial feature for the video captioning task. The recurrent encoding module encodes the video twice with a predicted key frame to avoid irrelevant temporal information often occurring at the beginning and at the end of a video. The novel spatial features represent spatial information from different regions of a video and provide the decoder with more detailed information. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show superior performance of the proposed method."
MvsGCN: A Novel Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-video Summarization,"Multi-video summarization, which tries to generate a single summary for a collection of video, is an important task in dealing with ever-growing video data. In this paper, we are the first to propose a graph convolutional network for multi-video summarization. The novel network measures the importance and relevance of each video shot in its own video as well as in the whole video collection. The important node sampling method is proposed to emphasize the effective features which are more possible to be selected as the final video summary. Two strategies are proposed to integrate into the network to solve the inherent class imbalance problem in the task of video summarization. The loss regularization for diversity is used to encourage a diverse summary to be generated. Extensive experiments are carried out, and in comparison with traditional and recent graph models and the state-of-the-art video summarization methods, our proposed model is effective in generating a representative summary for multiple videos with good diversity. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard video summarization datasets."
Stacked Memory Network for Video Summarization,"In recent years, supervised video summarization has achieved promising progress with various recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based methods, which treats video summarization as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem to exploit temporal dependency among video frames across variable ranges. However, RNN has limitations in modelling the long-term temporal dependency for summarizing videos with thousands of frames due to the restricted memory storage unit. Therefore, in this paper we propose a stacked memory network called SMN to explicitly model the long dependency among video frames so that redundancy could be minimized in the video summaries produced. Our proposed SMN consists of two key components: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer and memory layer, where each LSTM layer is augmented with an external memory layer. In particular, we stack multiple LSTM layers and memory layers hierarchically to integrate the learned representation from prior layers. By combining the hidden states of the LSTM layers and the read representations of the memory layers, our SMN is able to derive more accurate video summaries for individual video frames. Compared with the existing RNN based methods, our SMN is particularly good at capturing long temporal dependency among frames with few additional training parameters. Experimental results on two widely used public benchmark datasets: SumMe and TVsum, demonstrate that our proposed model is able to clearly outperform a number of state-of-the-art ones under various settings."
Generative Reconstructive Hashing for Incomplete Video Analysis,"In the literature of video analysis, most researches, such as retrieval and recognition, hypothesize that each input video contains at least one complete semantic entity, e.g. an activity, action and event.However, this hypothesis does not hold in many realistic scenarios due to two main reasons. First, complete videos whose qualities are good enough for automatic analysis are not always accessible because of heavy motion blur, occlusions, interruptions, etc. % Second, extracting features from complete videos always fails to meet up with speed and storage requirements in large-scale use cases.To tackle these challenges, incomplete videos are more useful, but researches on them are seldom mentioned. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective hashing framework specialized in large-scale incomplete video analysis called Generative Reconstructive Hashing (GRH). To begin with, an adversarial generative network that is specially designed to map incomplete video features to the feature distributions of complete videos, so that features of incomplete videos become indistinguishable from those of complete videos. Then, the discriminative hashing module further fills the gap between full video features and estimated features from partial videos by projecting both features into a common binary feature space, which allows improvement in efficiency compared with real-value based methods. GRH is the first end-to-end framework for incomplete video analysis. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate GRH's superior effectiveness and efficiency on retrieval and recognition tasks. GRH outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods by 5.44/3.22/4.82 in terms of MAPs on HMDB51/UCF101/CCV datasets, respectively."
You Only Recognize Once: Towards Fast Video Text Spotting,"Video text spotting is still an important research topic due to its various real-applications. Previous approaches usually fall into the four-staged pipeline: text detection in individual images, frame-wisely recognizing localized text regions, tracking text streams and generating final results with complicated post-processing skills, which might suffer from the huge computational cost as well as the interferences of low-quality text. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust video text spotting framework by only recognizing the localized text one-time instead of frame-wisely recognition. Specifically, we first obtain text regions in videos with a well-designed spatial-temporal detector. Then we concentrate on developing a novel text recommender for selecting the highest-quality text from text streams and only recognizing the selected ones. Here, the recommender assembles text tracking, quality scoring and recognition into an end-to-end trainable module, which not only avoids the interferences from low-quality text but also dramatically speeds up the video text spotting process. In addition, we collect a larger scale video text dataset (LSVTD) for promoting the video text spotting community, which contains 100 text videos from 22 different real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks show that our method greatly speeds up the recognition process averagely by 71 times compared with the frame-wise manner, and also achieves the remarkable state-of-the-art."
Black-box Adversarial Attacks on Video Recognition Models,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known for their vulnerability to adversarial examples. These are examples that have undergone small, carefully crafted perturbations, and which can easily fool a DNN into making misclassifications at test time. Thus far, the field of adversarial research has mainly focused on image models, under either a white-box setting, where an adversary has full access to model parameters, or a black-box setting where an adversary can only query the target model for probabilities or labels. Whilst several white-box attacks have been proposed for video models, black-box video attacks are still unexplored. To close this gap, we propose the first black-box video attack framework, called V-BAD. V-BAD utilizestentative perturbations transferred from image models andpartition-based rectifications found by the NES to obtain good adversarial gradient estimates with fewer queries to the target model. V-BAD is equivalent to estimating the projection of the adversarial gradient on a selected subspace. Using three benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that V-BAD can craft both untargeted and targeted attacks to fool two state-of-the-art deep video recognition models. For the targeted attack, it achieves $>$93% success rate using only an average of $3.4 \sim 8.4 \times 10^4$ queries, a similar number of queries to state-of-the-art black-box image attacks. This is despite the fact that videos often have two orders of magnitude higher dimensionality than static images. We believe that V-BAD is a promising new tool to evaluate and improve the robustness of video recognition models to black-box adversarial attacks."
Ranking Video Salient Object Detection,"Video salient object detection has been attracting more and more research interests recently. However, the definition of salient objects in videos has been controversial all the time, which has become a critical bottleneck in video salient object detection. Specifically, the sequential information contained in videos results in a fact that objects have a relative saliency ranking between each other rather than specific saliency. This implies that simply distinguishing objects into salient or not-salient as usual could not represent the information about saliency comprehensively. To address this issue, 1) in this paper we propose a completely new definition for the salient objects in videos---ranking salient objects, which considers relative saliency ranking assisted with eye fixation points. 2) Based on this definition, a ranking video salient object dataset(RVSOD) is built. 3) Leveraging our RVSOD, a novel neural network called Synthesized Video Saliency Network (SVSNet) is constructed to detect both traditional salient objects and human eye movements in videos. Finally, a ranking saliency module (RSM) takes the results of SVSNet as input to generate the ranking saliency maps. We hope our approach will serve as a baseline and lead to a conceptually new research in the field of video saliency."
Video Retargeting: Trade-off between Content Preservation and Spatio-temporal Consistency,"As new display technologies (i.e. foldable phone and modular display) with variable aspect ratios emerge, content-aware video retargeting has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. The content-aware video retargeting aims to adjust the aspect ratio of a video sequence while preserving both, its content and its spatio-temporal consistency. This is a particularly challenging task since these two properties may drastically differ and contradict depending on the video characteristics. In this paper, we explore this conflict in the context of video retargeting, then we propose an appropriate solution to alleviate this issue using a deep recurrent convolutional neural network architecture. First of all, we present a method to generate multiple ground-truth labels under various aspect ratios. Using this dataset, our network is trained to predict various retargeted video candidates from a single input sequence. The resulting candidates present different properties, some of them with more emphasis on the content preservation while the others focus on the spatio-temporal consistency. Among the generated candidates, the final result which satisfy the best compromise is selected. A large set of qualitative and quantitative experiments shows the ability of our method for the content-aware video retargeting."

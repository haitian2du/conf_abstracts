Micro Tells Macro: Predicting the Popularity of Micro-Videos via a Transductive Model,"Micro-videos, a new form of user generated contents (UGCs), are gaining increasing enthusiasm. Popular micro-videos have enormous commercial potential in many ways, such as online marketing and brand tracking. In fact, the popularity prediction of traditional UGCs including tweets, web images, and long videos, has achieved good theoretical underpinnings and great practical success. However, little research has thus far been conducted to predict the popularity of the bite-sized videos. This task is non-trivial due to three reasons: 1) micro-videos are short in duration and of low quality; 2) they can be described by multiple heterogeneous channels, spanning from social, visual, acoustic to textual modalities; and 3) there are no available benchmark dataset and discriminant features that are suitable for this task. Towards this end, we present a transductive multi-modal learning model. The proposed model is designed to find the optimal latent common space, unifying and preserving information from different modalities, whereby micro-videos can be better represented. This latent space can be used to alleviate the information insufficiency problem caused by the brief nature of micro-videos. In addition, we built a benchmark dataset and extracted a rich set of popularity-oriented features to characterize the popular micro-videos. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. As a side contribution, we have released the dataset, codes and parameters to facilitate other researchers."
Leveraging Contextual Cues for Generating Basketball Highlights,"The massive growth of sports videos has resulted in a need for automatic generation of sports highlights that are comparable in quality to the hand-edited highlights produced by broadcasters such as ESPN. Unlike previous works that mostly use audio-visual cues derived from the video, we propose an approach that additionally leverages contextual cues derived from the environment that the game is being played in. The contextual cues provide information about the excitement levels in the game, which can be ranked and selected to automatically produce high-quality basketball highlights. We introduce a new dataset of 25 NCAA games along with their play-by-play stats and the ground-truth excitement data for each basket. We explore the informativeness of five different cues derived from the video and from the environment through user studies. Our experiments show that for our study participants, the highlights produced by our system are comparable to the ones produced by ESPN for the same games."
Server Allocation for Multiplayer Cloud Gaming,"Advances in cloud computing and GPU virtualization are allowing the game industry to move into a cloud gaming era. While shifting standalone video games to the cloud gaming mode is straightforward, adapting multiplayer online games to the cloud gaming paradigm faces unique challenges. In this paper, we consider multiplayer cloud gaming (MCG), which is the natural integration of multiplayer online gaming and cloud gaming paradigms. We formulate an MCG server allocation problem with the objective of minimizing the total server rental and bandwidth cost charged by the cloud to support an MCG session. We propose several efficient heuristics to address the MCG server allocation problem which is hard to solve optimally. We conduct extensive experiments using real Internet latency and cloud pricing data to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as well as several alternatives. Experimental results show that our best algorithm can achieve near-optimal cost under real-time latency constraints."
Share-and-Chat: Achieving Human-Level Video Commenting by Search and Multi-View Embedding,"Video has become a predominant social media for the booming live interactions. Automatic generation of emotional comments to a video has great potential to significantly increase user engagement in many socio-video applications (e.g., chat bot). Nevertheless, the problem of video commenting has been overlooked by the research community. The major challenges are that the generated comments are to be not only as natural as those from human beings, but also relevant to the video content. We present in this paper a novel two-stage deep learning-based approach to automatic video commenting. Our approach consists of two components. The first component, similar video search, efficiently finds the visually similar videos w.r.t. a given video using approximate nearest-neighbor search based on the learned deep video representations, while the second dynamic ranking effectively ranks the comments associated with the searched similar videos by learning a deep multi-view embedding space. For modeling the emotional view of videos, we incorporate visual sentiment, video content, and text comments into the learning of the embedding space. On a newly collected dataset with over 102K videos and 10.6M comments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and achieves human-level video commenting."

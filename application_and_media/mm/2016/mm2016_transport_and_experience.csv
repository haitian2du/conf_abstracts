A Pragmatically Designed Adaptive and Web-compliant Object-based Video Streaming Methodology: Implementation and Subjective Evaluation,"The bulk of contemporary online video traffic is encoded in a traditional manner, hereby neglecting most, if not all, of the semantics of the underlying visual scene. One essential piece of semantic information in the context of video streaming is awareness of the objects that jointly constitute the scene. A canonical example of a benefit associated with such object awareness is the ability to subdivide a video fragment in respectively a background and one or more foreground objects. This paper reports on a pragmatically designed video streaming approach that exploits object-related knowledge in order to improve the real-time adaptability of video streaming sessions (manifested in the form of increased granularity in terms of streaming quality control). The proposed approach is completely compliant with present-day video codecs and HTTP Adaptive Streaming schemes, most notably H.264 and MPEG-DASH. Findings from subjecting the proposed video streaming technique to a comparative subjective evaluation suggest that scenarios exist where the presented approach holds the capacity to improve on traditional streaming in terms of user-perceived video quality."
A Perceptual Quality Metric for Videos Distorted by Spatially Correlated Noise,"Assessing the perceptual quality of videos is critical for monitoring and optimizing video processing pipelines. In this paper, we focus on predicting the perceptual quality of videos distorted by noise. Existing video quality metrics are tuned for ""white"", i.e., spatially uncorrelated noise. However, white noise is very rare in real videos. Based on our analysis of the noise correlation patterns in a broad and comprehensive video set, we build a video database that simulates the commonly encountered noise characteristics. Using the database, we develop a perceptual quality assessment algorithm that explicitly incorporates the noise correlations. Experimental results show that, for videos with spatially correlated noises, the proposed algorithm presents high accuracy in predicting perceptual qualities."
Zero-Shot Hashing via Transferring Supervised Knowledge,"Hashing has shown its efficiency and effectiveness in facilitating large-scale multimedia applications. Supervised knowledge (\emph{e.g.}, semantic labels or pair-wise relationship) associated to data is capable of significantly improving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However, confronted with the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the Web, existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity and validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual labelling. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, termed \emph{zero-shot hashing} (ZSH), which compresses images of ""unseen"" categories to binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of ""seen"" categories. Specifically, we project independent data labels (i.e., 0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space, where semantic relationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen supervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover, in order to cope with the semantic shift problem, we rotate the embedded space to more suitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space, thereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime, to exert positive effects on learning high-quality hash functions, we further propose to preserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes. Besides, we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model. Extensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior zero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several state-of-the-art hashing methods."
SDNDASH: Improving QoE of HTTP Adaptive Streaming Using Software Defined Networking,"HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is being adopted with increasing frequency and becoming the de-facto standard for video streaming. However, the client-driven, on-off adaptation behavior of HAS results in uneven bandwidth competition and this is exacerbated when a large number of clients share the same bottleneck network link and compete for the available bandwidth. With HAS each client independently strives to maximize its individual share of the available bandwidth, which leads to bandwidth competition and a decrease in end-user quality of experience (QoE). The competition causes scalability issues, which are quality instability, unfair bandwidth sharing and network resource underutilization. We propose a new software defined networking (SDN) based dynamic resource allocation and management architecture for HAS systems, which aims to alleviate these scalability issues and improve the per-client QoE. Our architecture manages and allocates the network resources dynamically for each client based on its expected QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly enhances scalability by improving per-client QoE by at least 30% and supporting up to 80% more clients with the same QoE compared to the conventional schemes."

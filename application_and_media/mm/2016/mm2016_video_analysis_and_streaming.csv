DRIVING: Distributed Scheduling for Video Streaming in Vehicular Wi-Fi Systems,"Video streaming has been dominating the mobile bandwidth, and is still expanding drastically. Its tremendous economic benefits have driven the automobile industry to equip vehicles with video streaming capacity. As a result, the new in-cabin Wi-Fi systems have been deployed, enabling each vehicle as a streaming hotspot on the wheels. A built-in Access Point (AP) bridges the communications between Wi-Fi devices inside and cellular networks outside. Distinct advantages offered by this system include a more powerful antenna array to improve multimedia quality, a constant energy source to power the streaming, etc. However, there exist two challenging features that may jeopardize the system performance. (1) The in-cabin Wi-Fi hotspots are mostly deployed on private vehicles, and thus are completely decentralized. (2) Video packets need to be delivered before their deadlines with small delays. Due to these features, existing algorithms may fail to efficiently schedule the in-cabin Wi-Fi video streaming. To fill the gap, we propose the Delay-awaRe dIstributed Video schedulING (DRIVING) framework. Being fully distributed and delay-aware, DRIVING not only increases the streaming goodput, but also reduces the delivery latency and deadline missing ratio. %In order to optimize this new framework, we establish cross-layer analytical models, which help us tune the framework parameters for better performance. In a typical scenario, DRIVING increases the goodput by up to 27.0%, while reducing the queueing delay and the deadline missing ratio by up to 40.0% and 38.4%, respectively."
Dynamic Resource Provisioning with QoS Guarantee for Video Transcoding in Online Video Sharing Service,"Video transcoding is widely adopted in online video sharing services to encode video content into multiple representations. This solution, however, could consume huge amount of computing resource and incur excessive processing delays. Moreover, content has heterogeneous QoS requirements for transcoding. Some content must be transcoded in real time, while some are deferrable for transcoding. It needs to determine the strategy for intelligently provisioning the right amount of resource under dynamic workload to meet the heterogeneous QoS requirements. To this end, this paper develops a robust dynamic resource provisioning scheme for transcoding with heterogeneous QoS criteria. We adopt the Preemptive Resume Priority discipline for scheduling, so that the transcoding-deferrable content can utilize idle resources for transcoding to maximize resource utilization while remain transparent to delay-sensitive content. We leverage Model Predictive Control to design the online algorithm for dynamic resource provisioning using predictions to accommodate time-varying workload. To seek robustness of system performance against prediction noises, we improve our online algorithm through Robust Design. The experiment results in a real environment demonstrate that our proposed framework can achieve the QoS requirements while reducing 50% of resource consumption on average."
High-speed Depth Stream Generation from a Hybrid Camera,"High-speed video has been commonly adopted in consumer-grade cameras, augmenting these videos with a corresponding depth stream will enable new multimedia applications, such as 3D slow-motion video. In this paper, we present a hybrid camera system that combines a high-speed color camera with a depth sensor, e.g. Kinect depth sensor, to generate a depth stream that can produce both high-speed and high-resolution RGB+depth stream. Simply interpolating the low-speed depth frames is not satisfactory, where interpolation artifacts and lose in surface details are often visible. We have developed a novel framework that utilizes both shading constraints within each frame and optical flow constraints between neighboring frames. More specifically we present (a) an effective method to find the intrinsics images to allow more accurate normal estimation; and (b) an optimization-based framework to estimate the high-resolution/high-speed depth stream, taking into consideration temporal smoothness and shading/depth consistency. We evaluated our holistic framework with both synthetic and real sequences, it showed superior performance than previous state-of-the-art."
Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Bandwidth Maps for Geo-Predictive Video Streaming in Mobile Environments,"High quality video streaming is increasingly popular among mobile users especially with the rise of high speed LTE networks. But despite the high network capacity of LTE, streaming videos may suffer from disruptions since the quality of the video depends on the network bandwidth, which in turn depends on the location of the user with respect to their cell tower, crowd levels, and objects like buildings and trees. Maintaining a good video playback experience becomes even more challenging if the user is moving fast in a vehicle, the location is changing rapidly and the available bandwidth fluctuates. In this paper we introduce GeoStream, a video streaming system that relies on the use of geostatistics to analyze spatio-temporal bandwidth. Data measured from users' streaming videos while they are commuting is collected in order to predict future bandwidth availability in unknown locations. Our approach investigates and leverages the relationship between the separation distance between sample bandwidth points, the time they were captured, and the semivariance, expressed by a variogram plot, to finally predict the future bandwidth at unknown locations. Using the datasets from GTube our experimental results show an improved performance."

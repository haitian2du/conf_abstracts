Query Adaptive Instance Search using Object Sketches,"Sketch-based object search is a challenging problem mainly due to two difficulties: (1) how to match the binary sketch query with the colorful image, and (2) how to locate the small object in a big image with the sketch query. To address the above challenges, we propose to leverage object proposals for object search and localization. However, instead of purely relying on sketch features, e.g., Sketch-a-Net, to locate the candidate object proposals, we propose to fully utilize the appearance information to resolve the ambiguities among object proposals and refine the search results. Our proposed query adaptive search is formulated as a sub-graph selection problem, which can be solved by maximum flow algorithm. By performing query expansion using a smaller set of more salient matches as the query representatives, it can accurately locate the small target objects in cluttered background or densely drawn deformation intensive cartoon (Manga like) images. Our query adaptive sketch based object search on benchmark datasets exhibits superior performance when compared with existing methods, which validates the advantages of utilizing both the shape and appearance features for sketch-based search."
Key Color Generation for Affective Multimedia Production: An Initial Method and Its Application,"In this paper, we introduce a method that generates a key color to construct an aesthetic and affective harmony with visual content. Given an image and an affective term, our method creates a key color by combining a dominant hue of the image and a unique tone associated with the affective word. To match each affective term with a specific tone, we collected color themes from a crowd-sourced database and identified the most popular tone of color themes that are relevant to each affective term. The results of a user test showed that the method generates satisfactory key colors as much as designers do. Finally, as a prospective application, we employed our method to a promotional video editing prototype. Our method automatically generates a key color based on a frame of an input video and apply the color to a shape that delivers a promotional message. A second user study verifies that the video editing prototype with our method can effectively deliver the desired affective state with a satisfactory quality."
Academic Coupled Dictionary Learning for Sketch-based Image Retrieval,"In the last few years, the query-by-visual-example paradigm gained popularity, specially for content based retrieval systems. As sketches represent a natural way of expressing a synthetic query, recent research efforts focused on developing algorithmic solutions to address the sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) problem. Within this context, we propose a novel approach for SBIR that, unlike previous methods, is able to exploit the visual complexity inherently present in sketches and images. We introduce academic learning, a paradigm in which the sample learning order is constructed both from the data, as in self-paced learning, and from partial curricula. We propose an instantiation of this paradigm within the framework of coupled dictionary learning to address the SBIR task. We also present an efficient algorithm to learn the dictionaries and the codes, and to pace the learning combining the reconstruction error, the prior knowledge suggested by the partial curricula and the cross-domain code coherence. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we report an extensive experimental validation showing that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in coupled dictionary learning and in SBIR on three different publicly available datasets."
Time Matters: Multi-scale Temporalization of Social Media Popularity,"The evolution of social media popularity exhibits rich temporality, i.e., popularities change over time at various levels of temporal granularity. This is influenced by temporal variations of public attentions or user activities. For example, popularity patterns of street snap on Flickr are observed to depict distinctive fashion styles at specific time scales, such as season-based periodic fluctuations for Trench Coat or one-off peak in days for Evening Dress. However, this fact is often overlooked by existing research of popularity modeling. We present the first study to incorporate multiple time-scale dynamics into predicting online popularity. We propose a novel computational framework in the paper, named Multi-scale Temporalization, for estimating popularity based on multi-scale decomposition and structural reconstruction in a tensor space of user, post, and time by joint low-rank constraints. By considering the noise caused by context inconsistency, we design a data rearrangement step based on context aggregation as preprocessing to enhance contextual relevance of neighboring data in the tensor space. As a result, our approach can leverage multiple levels of temporal characteristics and reduce the noise of data decomposition to improve modeling effectiveness. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale Flickr image datasets with over 1.8 million photos in total, for the task of popularity prediction. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art popularity prediction techniques, with a relative improvement of 10.9%-47.5% in terms of prediction accuracy."

Transform-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification and Search,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on many visual recognition tasks. However, current CNN models still exhibit a poor ability to be invariant to spatial transformations of images. Intuitively, with sufficient layers and parameters, hierarchical combinations of convolution (matrix multiplication and non-linear activation) and pooling operations should be able to learn a robust mapping from transformed input images to transform-invariant representations. In this paper, we propose randomly transforming (rotation, scale, and translation) feature maps of CNNs during the training stage. This prevents complex dependencies of specific rotation, scale, and translation levels of training images in CNN models. Rather, each convolutional kernel learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the transform-invariant answer given the combinatorially large variety of transform levels of its input feature maps. In this way, we do not require any extra training supervision or modification to the optimization process and training images. We show that random transformation provides significant improvements of CNNs on many benchmark tasks, including small-scale image recognition, large-scale image recognition, and image retrieval."
PL-ranking: A Novel Ranking Method for Cross-Modal Retrieval,"This paper proposes a novel method for cross-modal retrieval named Pairwise-Listwise \textbf{ranking} (PL-ranking) based on the low-rank optimization framework. Motivated by the fact that optimizing the top of ranking is more applicable in practice, we focus on improving the precision at the top of ranked list for a given sample and learning a low-dimensional common subspace for multi-modal data. Concretely, there are three constraints in PL-ranking. First, we use a pairwise ranking loss constraint to optimize the top of ranking. Then, considering that the pairwise ranking loss constraint ignores class information, we further adopt a listwise constraint to minimize the intra-neighbors variance and maximize the inter-neighbors separability. By this way, class information is preserved while the number of iterations is reduced. Finally, low-rank based regularization is applied to exploit the correlations between features and labels so that the relevance between the different modalities can be enhanced after mapping them into the common subspace. We design an efficient low-rank stochastic subgradient descent method to solve the proposed optimization problem. The experimental results show that the average MAP scores of PL-ranking are improved 5.1%, 9.2%, 4.7% and 4.8% than those of the state-of-the-art methods on the Wiki, Flickr, Pascal and NUS-WIDE datasets, respectively."
Video eCommerce: Towards Online Video Advertising,"The prevalence of online videos provides an opportunity for e-commerce companies to exhibit their product ads in videos by recommendation. In this paper, we propose an advertising system named Video eCommerce to exhibit appropriate product ads to particular users at proper time stamps of videos, which takes into account video semantics, user shopping preference and viewing behavior feedback by a two-level strategy. At the first level, Co-Relation Regression (CRR) model is novelly proposed to construct the semantic association between keyframes and products. Heterogeneous information network (HIN) is adopted to build the user shopping preference from two different e-commerce platforms, Tmall and MagicBox, which alleviates the problems of data sparsity and cold start. In addition, Video Scene Importance Model (VSIM) utilizes the viewing behavior of users to embed ads at the most attractive position within the video stream. At the second level, taking the results of CRR, HIN and VSIM as the input, Heterogeneous Relation Matrix Factorization (HRMF) is applied for product advertising. Extensive evaluation on a variety of online videos from Tmall MagicBox demonstrates that Video eCommerce achieves promising performance, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art advertising methods."
Affective Contextual Mobile Recommender System,"Exponential growth of media consumption in online social networks demands effective recommendation to improve the quality of experience especially for on-the-go mobile users. By means of large-scale trace-driven measurements over mobile Twitter traces from users, we reveal the significance of affective features in shaping users' social media behaviors. Existing recommender systems however, rarely support this psychological effect in real-life. To capture this effect, in this paper we propose Kaleido, a real mobile system to achieve an affect-aware learning-based social media recommendation.Specifically, we design a machine learning mechanism to infer the affective feature within media contents. Furthermore, a cluster-based latent bias model is provided for jointly training the affect, behavior and social contexts. Our comprehensive experiments on Android prototype expose a superior prediction accuracy of 82%, with more than 20% accuracy improvement over existing mobile recommender systems. Moreover, by enabling users to offload their machine learning procedures to the deployed edge-cloud testbed, our system achieves speed-up of a factor of 1,000 against the local data training execution on smartphones."

Research Challenges in Developing Multimedia Systems for Managing Emergency Situations,"With an increasing amount of diverse heterogeneous data and information, the methodology of multimedia analysis has become increasingly relevant in solving challenging societal problems such as managing emergency situations during disasters. Using cybernetic principles combined with multimedia technology, researchers can develop effective frameworks for using diverse multimedia (including traditional multimedia as well as diverse multimodal) data for situation recognition, and determining and communicating appropriate actions to people stranded during disasters. We present known issues in disaster management and then focus on emergency situations. We show that an emergency management problem is fundamentally a multimedia information assimilation problem for situation recognition and for connecting people's needs to available resources effectively, efficiently, and promptly. Major research challenges for managing emergency situations are identified and discussed. We also present a intelligently detecting evolving environmental situations, and discuss the role of multimedia micro-reports as spontaneous participatory sensing data streams in emergency responses. Given enormous progress in concept recognition using machine learning in the last few years, situation recognition may be the next major challenge for learning approaches in multimedia contextual big data. The data needed for developing such approaches is now easily available on the Web and many challenging research problems in this area are ripe for exploration in order to positively impact our society during its most difficult times."
Multimedia on the Mountaintop: Using Public Snow Images to Improve Water Systems Operation,"This paper merges multimedia and environmental research to verify the utility of public web images for improving water management in periods of water scarcity, an increasingly critical event due to climate change. A multimedia processing pipeline fetches mountain images from multiple sources and extracts virtual snow indexes correlated to the amount of water accumulated in the snow pack. Such indexes are used to predict water availability and design the operating policy of Lake Como, Italy. The performance of this informed policy is contrasted, via simulation, with the current operation, which depends only on lake water level and day of the year, and with a policy that exploits official Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) estimated from ground stations data and satellite imagery. Virtual snow indexes allow improving the system performance by 11.6% w.r.t. the baseline operation, and yield further improvement when coupled with official SWE information, showing that the two data sources are complementary. The proposed approach exemplifies the opportunities and challenges of applying multimedia content analysis methods to complex environmental problems."
Crowdsourcing Biodiversity Monitoring: How Sharing your Photo Stream can Sustain our Planet,"Large scale biodiversity monitoring is essential for sustainable development (earth stewardship). With the recent advances in computer vision, we see the emergence of more and more effective identification tools allowing to set-up large-scale data collection platforms such as the popular [email protected] initiative that allow to reuse interaction data. Although it covers only a fraction of the world flora, this platform is already being used by more than 300K people who produce tens of thousands of validated plant observations each year. This explicitly shared and validated data is only the tip of the iceberg. The real potential relies on the millions of raw image queries submitted by the users of the mobile application for which there is no human validation. People make such requests to get information on a plant along a hike or something they find in their garden but not know anything about. Allowing the exploitation of such contents in a fully automatic way could scale up the world-wide collection of implicit plant observations by several orders of magnitude, which can complement the explicit monitoring efforts. In this paper, we first survey existing automated plant identification systems through a five-year synthesis of the PlantCLEF benchmark and an impact study of the [email protected] platform. We then focus on the implicit monitoring scenario and discuss related research challenges at the frontier of computer science and biodiversity studies. Finally, we discuss the results of a preliminary study focused on implicit monitoring of invasive species in mobile search logs. We show that the results are promising but that there is room for improvement before being able to automatically share implicit observations within international platforms."
Multimedia and Medicine: Teammates for Better Disease Detection and Survival,"Health care has a long history of adopting technology to save lives and improve the quality of living. Visual information is frequently applied for disease detection and assessment, and the established fields of computer vision and medical imaging provide essential tools. It is, however, a misconception that disease detection and assessment are provided exclusively by these fields and that they provide the solution for all challenges. Integration and analysis of data from several sources, real-time processing, and the assessment of usefulness for end-users are core competences of the multimedia community and are required for the successful improvement of health care systems. We have conducted initial investigations into two use cases surrounding diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where the detection of abnormalities provides the largest chance of successful treatment if the initial observation of disease indicators occurs before the patient notices any symptoms. Although such detection is typically provided visually by applying an endoscope, we are facing a multitude of new multimedia challenges that differ between use cases. In real-time assistance for colonoscopy, we combine sensor information about camera position and direction to aid in detecting, investigate means for providing support to doctors in unobtrusive ways, and assist in reporting. In the area of large-scale capsular endoscopy, we investigate questions of scalability, performance and energy efficiency for the recording phase, and combine video summarization and retrieval questions for analysis."

Human Pose Estimation from Depth Images via Inference Embedded Multi-task Learning,"Human pose estimation (i.e., locating the body parts / joints of a person) is a fundamental problem in human-computer interaction and multimedia applications. Significant progress has been made based on the development of depth sensors, i.e., accessible human pose prediction from still depth images~\cite{rf12pami}. However, most of the existing approaches to this problem involve several components/models that are independently designed and optimized, leading to suboptimal performances. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-embedded multi-task learning framework for predicting human pose from still depth images, which is implemented with a deep architecture of neural networks. Specifically, we handle two cascaded tasks: i) generating the heat (confidence) maps of body parts via a fully convolutional network (FCN); ii) seeking the optimal configuration of body parts based on the detected body part proposals via an inference built-in MatchNet~\cite{mn15cvpr}, which measures the appearance and geometric kinematic compatibility of body parts and embodies the dynamic programming inference as an extra network layer. These two tasks are jointly optimized. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed deep model significantly improves the accuracy of human pose estimation over other several state-of-the-art methods or SDKs. We also release a large-scale dataset for comparison, which includes 100K depth images under challenging scenarios."
Cross-batch Reference Learning for Deep Classification and Retrieval,"Learning feature representations for image retrieval is essential to multimedia search and mining applications. Recently, deep convolutional networks (CNNs) have gained much attention due to their impressive performance on object detection and image classification, and the feature representations learned from a large-scale generic dataset (e.g., ImageNet) can be transferred to or fine-tuned on the datasets of other domains. However, when the feature representations learned with a deep CNN are applied to image retrieval, the performance is still not as good as they are used for classification, which restricts their applicability to relevant image search. To ensure the retrieval capability of the learned feature space, we introduce a new idea called cross-batch reference (CBR) to enhance the stochastic-gradient-descent (SGD) training of CNNs. In each iteration of our training process, the network adjustment relies not only on the training samples in a single batch, but also on the information passed by the samples in the other batches. This inter-batches communication mechanism is formulated as a cross-batch retrieval process based on the mean average precision (MAP) criterion, where the relevant and irrelevant samples are encouraged to be placed on top and rear of the retrieval list, respectively. The learned feature space is not only discriminative to different classes, but the samples that are relevant to each other or of the same class are also enforced to be centralized. To maximize the cross-batch MAP, we design a loss function that is an approximated lower bound of the MAP on the feature layer of the network, which is differentiable and easier for optimization. By combining the intra-batch classification and inter-batch cross-reference losses, the learned features are effective for both classification and retrieval tasks. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Binary Optimized Hashing,"This paper studies the problem of learning to hash, which is essentially a mixed integer optimization problem, containing both the binary hash code output and the (continuous) parameters forming the hash functions. Different from existing relaxation methods in hashing, which have no theoretical guarantees for the error bound of the relaxations, we propose binary optimized hashing (BOH), in which we prove that if the loss function is Lipschitz continuous, the binary optimization problem can be relaxed to a bound-constrained continuous optimization problem. Then we introduce a surrogate objective function, which only depends on unbinarized hash functions and does not need the slack variables transforming unbinarized hash functions to discrete functions, to approximate the relaxed objective function. We show that the approximation error is bounded and the bound is small when the problem is optimized. We apply the proposed approach to learn hash codes from either handcraft feature inputs or raw image inputs. Extensive experiments are carried out on three benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts with a significant margin on search accuracies."
Linear Distance Preserving Pseudo-Supervised and Unsupervised Hashing,"With the advantage in compact representation and efficient comparison, binary hashing has been extensively investigated for approximate nearest neighbor search. In this paper, we propose a novel and general hashing framework, which simultaneously considers a new linear pair-wise distance preserving objective and point-wise constraint. The direct distance preserving objective aims to keep the linear relationships between the Euclidean distance and the Hamming distance of data points. Based on different point-wise constraints, we propose two methods to instantiate this framework. The first one is a pseudo-supervised hashing method, which uses existing unsupervised hashing methods to generate binary codes as pseudo-supervised information. The second one is an unsupervised hashing method, in which quantization loss is considered. We validate our framework on two large-scale datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our pseudo-supervised method achieves consistent improvement for the state-of-the-art unsupervised hashing methods, while our unsupervised method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."

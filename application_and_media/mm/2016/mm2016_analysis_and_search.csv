Event Specific Multimodal Pattern Mining for Knowledge Base Construction,"Knowledge bases, which consist of a collection of entities, attributes, and the relations between them are widely used and important for many information retrieval tasks. Knowledge base schemas are often constructed manually using experts with specific domain knowledge for the field of interest. Once the knowledge base is generated then many tasks such as automatic content extraction and knowledge base population can be performed, which have so far been robustly studied by the Natural Language Processing community. However, the current approaches ignore visual information that could be used to build or populate these structured ontologies. Preliminary work on visual knowledge base construction only explores limited basic objects and scene relations. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal pattern mining approach towards constructing a high-level ""event"" schema semi-automatically, which has the capability to extend text only methods for schema construction. We utilize a large unconstrained corpus of weakly-supervised image-caption pairs related to high-level events such as ""attack"" and ""demonstration"" to both discover visual aspects of an event, and name these visual components automatically. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art visual pattern mining approaches and demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve dramatic improvements in terms of the number of concepts discovered (33% gain), semantic consistence of visual patterns (52% gain), and correctness of pattern naming (150% gain)."
Joint Graph Learning and Video Segmentation via Multiple Cues and Topology Calibration,"Video segmentation has become an important and active research area with a large diversity of proposed approaches. Graph-based methods, enabling top performance on recent benchmarks, usually focus on either obtaining a precise similarity graph or designing efficient graph cutting strategies. However, these two components are often conducted in two separated steps, and thus the obtained similarity graph may not be the optimal one for segmentation and this may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, joint graph learning and video segmentation (JGLVS)}, which learns the similarity graph and video segmentation simultaneously. JGLVS learns the similarity graph by assigning adaptive neighbors for each vertex based on multiple cues (appearance, motion, boundary and spatial information). Meanwhile, the new rank constraint is imposed to the Laplacian matrix of the similarity graph, such that the connected components in the resulted similarity graph are exactly equal to the number of segmentations. Furthermore, JGLVS can automatically weigh multiple cues and calibrate the pairwise distance of superpixels based on their topology structures. Most noticeably, empirical results on the challenging dataset VSB100 show that JGLVS achieves promising performance on the benchmark dataset which outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 11% for the BPR metric."
Parsimonious Mixed-Effects HodgeRank for Crowdsourced Preference Aggregation,"In crowdsourced preference aggregation, it is often assumed that all the annotators are subject to a common preference or utility function which generates their comparison behaviors in experiments. However, in reality annotators are subject to variations due to multi-criteria, abnormal, or a mixture of such behaviors. In this paper, we propose a parsimonious mixed-effects model based on HodgeRank, which takes into account both the fixed effect that the majority of annotators follows a common linear utility model, and the random effect that a small subset of annotators might deviate from the common significantly and exhibits strongly personalized preferences. HodgeRank has been successfully applied to subjective quality evaluation of multimedia and resolves pairwise crowdsourced ranking data into a global consensus ranking and cyclic conflicts of interests. As an extension, our proposed methodology further explores the conflicts of interests through the random effect in annotator specific variations. The key algorithm in this paper establishes a dynamic path from the common utility to individual variations, with different levels of parsimony or sparsity on personalization, based on newly developed Linearized Bregman Algorithms with Inverse Scale Space method. Finally the validity of the methodology are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and three real-world crowdsourcing datasets, which shows that our proposed method exhibits better performance (i.e. smaller test error) compared with HodgeRank due to its parsimonious property."
Weighted Linear Fusion of Multimodal Data: A Reasonable Baseline?,"The ever-increasing demand for reliable inference capable of handling unpredictable challenges of practical application in the real world, has made research on information fusion of major importance. There are few fields of application and research where this is more evident than in the sphere of multimedia which by its very nature inherently involves the use of multiple modalities, be it for learning, prediction, or human-computer interaction, say. In the development of the most common type, score-level fusion algorithms, it is virtually without an exception desirable to have as a reference starting point a simple and universally sound baseline benchmark which newly developed approaches can be compared to. One of the most pervasively used methods is that of weighted linear fusion. It has cemented itself as the default off-the-shelf baseline owing to its simplicity of implementation, interpretability, and surprisingly competitive performance across a wide range of application domains and information source types. In this paper I argue that despite this track record, weighted linear fusion is not a good baseline on the grounds that there is an equally simple and interpretable alternative - namely quadratic mean-based fusion - which is theoretically more principled and which is more successful in practice. I argue the former from first principles and demonstrate the latter using a series of experiments on a diverse set of fusion problems: computer vision-based object recognition, arrhythmia detection, and fatality prediction in motor vehicle accidents."

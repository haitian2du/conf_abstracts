Predicting Which Topics You Will Join in the Future on Social Media,"Every day, social media users send millions of microblogs on every imaginable topics. If we could predict which topics a user will join in the future, it would be easy to determine what topics will become popular and what kinds of users a topic may attract. It also can be of great interest for many applications. In this study, we investigate the problem of predicting whether a user will join a topic based on his posting history. We introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network with external neural memory and attention mechanism to perform this problem. User's posting history and topics were modeled with an external neural memory architecture. The convolutional neural network based matching methods were used to construct the relations between users and topics. Final decisions were made based on these matching results. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we collected a large-scale dataset from Twitter. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method could perform significantly better than other methods. Comparing to the state-of-the-art deep neural networks, our approach achieves a relative improvement of 18.2\% in F1-score and 28.9\% in [emailÂ protected]"
What Are You Known For?: Learning User Topical Profiles with Implicit and Explicit Footprints,"User interests and expertise are valuable but often hidden resources on social media. For example, Twitter Lists and LinkedIn's Skill Tags provide a partial perspective on what users are known for (by aggregating crowd tagging knowledge), but the vast majority of users are untagged; their interests and expertise are essentially hidden from important applications such as personalized recommendation, community detection, and expert mining. A natural approach to overcome these limitations is to intelligently learn user topical profiles by exploiting information from multiple, heterogeneous footprints: for instance, Twitter users who post similar hashtags may have similar interests, and YouTube users who upvote the same videos may have similar preferences. And yet identifying ""similar"" users by exploiting similarity in such a footprint space often provides conflicting evidence, leading to poor-quality user profiles. In this paper, we propose a unified model for learning user topical profiles that simultaneously considers multiple footprints. We show how these footprints can be embedded in a generalized optimization framework that takes into account pairwise relations among all footprints for robustly learning user profiles. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model is capable of learning high-quality user topical profiles, and leads to a 10-15% improvement in precision and mean average error versus a cross-triadic factorization state-of-the-art baseline."
Hierarchical Community-Level Information Diffusion Modeling in Social Networks,"Recently, online social networks are becoming increasingly popular platforms for social interactions. Understanding how information propagates in such networks is important for personalization and recommendation in social search."

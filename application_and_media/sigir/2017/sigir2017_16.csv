Learning a Hierarchical Embedding Model for Personalized Product Search,"Product search is an important part of online shopping. In contrast to many search tasks, the objectives of product search are not confined to retrieving relevant products. Instead, it focuses on finding items that satisfy the needs of individuals and lead to a user purchase. The unique characteristics of product search make search personalization essential for both customers and e-shopping companies. Purchase behavior is highly personal in online shopping and users often provide rich feedback about their decisions (e.g. product reviews). However, the severe mismatch found in the language of queries, products and users make traditional retrieval models based on bag-of-words assumptions less suitable for personalization in product search. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical embedding model to learn semantic representations for entities (i.e. words, products, users and queries) from different levels with their associated language data. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) our work is one of the initial studies on personalized product search; (2) our hierarchical embedding model is the first latent space model that jointly learns distributed representations for queries, products and users with a deep neural network; (3) each component of our network is designed as a generative model so that the whole structure is explainable and extendable. Following the methodology of previous studies, we constructed personalized product search benchmarks with Amazon product data. Experiments show that our hierarchical embedding model significantly outperforms existing product search baselines on multiple benchmark datasets."
Exploring User-Specific Information in Music Retrieval,"With the advancement of mobile computing technology and cloud-based streaming music service, user-centered music retrieval has become increasingly important. User-specific information has a fundamental impact on personal music preferences and interests. However, existing research pays little attention to the modeling and integration of user-specific information in music retrieval algorithms/models to facilitate music search. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named User-Information-Aware Music Interest Topic (UIA-MIT) model. The model is able to effectively capture the influence of user-specific information on music preferences, and further associate users' music preferences and search terms under the same latent space. Based on this model, a user information aware retrieval system is developed, which can search and re-rank the results based on age- and/or gender-specific music preferences. A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that our methods can significantly improve the search accuracy over existing text-based music retrieval methods."
The Utility and Privacy Effects of a Click,"Recommenders are becoming one of the main ways to navigate the Internet. They recommend appropriate items to users based on their clicks, i.e., likes, ratings, purchases, etc. These clicks are key to providing relevant recommendations and, in this sense, have a significant utility. Since clicks reflect the preferences of users, they also raise privacy concerns. At first glance, there seems to be an inherent trade-off between the utility and privacy effects of a click. Nevertheless, a closer look reveals that the situation is more subtle: some clicks do improve utility without compromising privacy, whereas others decrease utility while hampering privacy."
Privacy through Solidarity: A User-Utility-Preserving Framework to Counter Profiling,"Online service providers gather vast amounts of data to build user profiles. Such profiles improve service quality through personalization, but may also intrude on user privacy and incur discrimination risks. In this work, we propose a framework which leverages solidarity in a large community to scramble user interaction histories. While this is beneficial for anti-profiling, the potential downside is that individual user utility, in terms of the quality of search results or recommendations, may severely degrade. To reconcile privacy and user utility and control their trade-off, we develop quantitative models for these dimensions and effective strategies for assigning user interactions to Mediator Accounts. We demonstrate the viability of our framework by experiments in two different application areas (search and recommender systems), using two large datasets."

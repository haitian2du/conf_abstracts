Engaged or Frustrated?: Disambiguating Emotional State in Search,"One of the primary ways researchers have characterized engagement during information search is by increases in search behaviors, such as queries and clicks. However, studies have shown that frustration is also characterized by increases in these same behaviors. This research examines the differences in the search behaviors and physiologies of people who are engaged or frustrated during search. A 2x2 within-subject laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Engagement was induced by manipulating task interest and frustration was induced by manipulating the quality of the search results. Participants' interactions and physiological responses were recorded, and after they searched, they evaluated their levels of engagement, frustration and stress. Participants reported significantly greater levels of engagement when completing tasks that interested them and significantly less engagement during searches with poor results quality. For all search behaviors measured, only two significant differences were found according to task interest: participants had more scrolls and longer query intervals when searching for interesting tasks, suggesting greater interaction with content. Significant differences were found for nine behaviors according to results quality, including queries issued, number of SERPs displayed and number of SERP clicks, suggesting these are potentially better indicators of frustration rather than engagement. When presented with poor quality results, participants had significantly higher heart rates than when presented with normal quality results. Finally, participants had lower heart rates and greater skin conductance responses when conducting interesting tasks than when conducting uninteresting tasks. This research provides insight into the differences in search behaviors and physiologies of participants when they are engaged versus frustrated and presents techniques that can be used by those wishing to induce engagement and frustration during laboratory IIR studies."
"A Study of Snippet Length and Informativeness: Behaviour, Performance and User Experience","The design and presentation of a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) has been subject to much research. With many contemporary aspects of the SERP now under scrutiny, work still remains in investigating more traditional SERP components, such as the result summary. Prior studies have examined a variety of different aspects of result summaries, but in this paper we investigate the influence of result summary length on search behaviour, performance and user experience. To this end, we designed and conducted a within-subjects experiment using the TREC AQUAINT news collection with 53 participants. Using Kullback-Leibler distance as a measure of information gain, we examined result summaries of different lengths and selected four conditions where the change in information gain was the greatest: (i) title only; (ii) title plus one snippet; (iii) title plus two snippets; and (iv) title plus four snippets. Findings show that participants broadly preferred longer result summaries, as they were perceived to be more informative. However, their performance in terms of correctly identifying relevant documents was similar across all four conditions. Furthermore, while the participants felt that longer summaries were more informative, empirical observations suggest otherwise; while participants were more likely to click on relevant items given longer summaries, they also were more likely to click on non-relevant items. This shows that longer is not necessarily better, though participants perceived that to be the case - and second, they reveal a positive relationship between the length and informativeness of summaries and their attractiveness (i.e. clickthrough rates). These findings show that there are tensions between perception and performance when designing result summaries that need to be taken into account."
Improving Exploratory Search Experience through Hierarchical Knowledge Graphs,"In information retrieval and information visualization, hierarchies are a common tool to structure information into topics or facets, and network visualizations such as knowledge graphs link related concepts within a domain. In this paper, we explore a multi-layer extension to knowledge graphs, hierarchical knowledge graphs (HKGs), that combines hierarchical and network visualizations into a unified data representation. Through interaction logs, we show that HKGs preserve the benefits of single-layer knowledge graphs at conveying domain knowledge while incorporating the sense-making advantages of hierarchies for knowledge seeking tasks. Specially, this paper describes our algorithm to construct these visualizations, analyzes interaction logs to quantitatively demonstrate performance parity with networks and performance advantages over hierarchies, and synthesizes data from interaction logs, inter- views, and thinkalouds on a testbed data set to demonstrate the utility of the unified hierarchy+network structure in our HKGs."
Searching on the Go: The Effects of Fragmented Attention on Mobile Web Search Tasks,"Smart phones and tablets are rapidly becoming our main method of accessing information and are frequently used to perform on-the-go search tasks. Mobile devices are commonly used in situations where attention must be divided, such as when walking down a street. Research suggests that this increases cognitive load and, therefore, may have an impact on performance. In this work we conducted a laboratory experiment with both device types in which we simulated everyday, common mobile situations that may cause fragmented attention, impact search performance and affect user perception."
User Interaction Sequences for Search Satisfaction Prediction,"Detecting and understanding implicit measures of user satisfaction are essential for meaningful experimentation aimed at enhancing web search quality. While most existing studies on satisfaction prediction rely on users' click activity and query reformulation behavior, often such signals are not available for all search sessions and as a result, not useful in predicting satisfaction. On the other hand, user interaction data (such as mouse cursor movement) is far richer than just click data and can provide useful signals for predicting user satisfaction. In this work, we focus on considering holistic view of user interaction with the search engine result page (SERP) and construct detailed universal interaction sequences of their activity. We propose novel ways of leveraging the universal interaction sequences to automatically extract informative, interpretable subsequences. In addition to extracting frequent, discriminatory and interleaved subsequences, we propose a Hawkes process model to incorporate temporal aspects of user interaction. Through extensive experimentation we show that encoding the extracted subsequences as features enables us to achieve significant improvements in predicting user satisfaction. We additionally present an analysis of the correlation between various subsequences and user satisfaction. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach in covering abandonment cases. Our findings provide a valuable tool for fine-grained analysis of user interaction behavior for metric development."

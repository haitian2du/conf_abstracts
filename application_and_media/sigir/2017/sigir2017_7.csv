Understanding and Modeling Success in Email Search,"Email has been a dominant form of communication for many years, and email search is an important problem. In contrast to other search setting, such as web search, there have been few studies of user behavior and models of email search success. Research in email search is challenging for many reasons including the personal and private nature of the collection. Third party judges can not look at email search queries or email message content requiring new modeling techniques."
Investigating Examination Behavior of Image Search Users,"Image search engines show results differently from general Web search engines in three key ways: (1) most Web-based image search engines adopt the two-dimensional result placement instead of the linear result list; (2) image searches show snapshots instead of snippets (query-dependent abstracts of landing pages) on search engine result pages (SERPs); and (3) pagination is usually not (explicitly) supported on image search SERPs, and users can view results without having to click on the ""next page'' button. Compared with the extensive study of user behavior in general Web search scenarios, there exists no thorough investigation how the different interaction mechanism of image search engines affects users' examination behavior. To shed light on this research question, we conducted an eye-tracking study to investigate users' examination behavior in image searches. We focus on the impacts of factors in examination including position, visual saliency, edge density, the existence of textual information, and human faces in result images. Three interesting findings indicate users' behavior biases: (1) instead of the traditional ""Golden Triangle'' phenomena in the user examination patterns of general Web search, we observe a middle-position bias, (2) besides the position factor, the content of image results (e.g., visual saliency) affects examination behavior, and (3) some popular behavior assumptions in general Web search (e.g., examination hypothesis) do not hold in image search scenarios. We predict users' examination behavior with different impact factors. Results show that combining position and visual content features can improve prediction in image searches."
Extracting Hierarchies of Search Tasks & Subtasks via a Bayesian Nonparametric Approach,"A significant amount of search queries originate from some real world information need or tasks [13]. In order to improve the search experience of the end users, it is important to have accurate representations of tasks. As a result, significant amount of research has been devoted to extracting proper representations of tasks in order to enable search systems to help users complete their tasks, as well as providing the end user with better query suggestions [9], for better recommendations [41], for satisfaction prediction [36] and for improved personalization in terms of tasks [24, 38]. Most existing task extraction methodologies focus on representing tasks as flat structures. However, tasks often tend to have multiple subtasks associated with them and a more naturalistic representation of tasks would be in terms of a hierarchy, where each task can be composed of multiple (sub)tasks. To this end, we propose an efficient Bayesian nonparametric model for extracting hierarchies of such tasks & subtasks. We evaluate our method based on real world query log data both through quantitative and crowdsourced experiments and highlight the importance of considering task/subtask hierarchies."
Using Information Scent to Understand Mobile and Desktop Web Search Behavior,"This paper investigates if Information Foraging Theory can be used to understand differences in user behavior when searching on mobile and desktop web search systems. Two groups of thirty-six participants were recruited to carry out six identical web search tasks on desktop or on mobile. The search tasks were prepared with a different number and distribution of relevant documents on the first result page. Search behaviors on mobile and desktop were measurably different. Desktop participants viewed and clicked on more results but saved fewer as relevant, compared to mobile participants, when information scent level increased. Mobile participants achieved higher search accuracy than desktop participants for tasks with increasing numbers of relevant search results. Conversely, desktop participants were more accurate than mobile participants for tasks with an equal number of relevant results that were more distributed across the results page. Overall, both an increased number and better positioning of relevant search results improved the ability of participants to locate relevant results on both desktop and mobile. Participants spent more time and issued more queries on desktop, but abandoned less and saved more results for initial queries on mobile."
Deep Character-Level Click-Through Rate Prediction for Sponsored Search,"Predicting the click-through rate of an advertisement is a critical component of online advertising platforms. In sponsored search, the click-through rate estimates the probability that a displayed advertisement is clicked by a user after she submits a query to the search engine. Commercial search engines typically rely on machine learning models trained with a large number of features to make such predictions. This inevitably requires a lot of engineering efforts to define, compute, and select the appropriate features. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches (one working at character level and the other working at word level) that use deep convolutional neural networks to predict the click-through rate of a query-advertisement pair. Specifically, the proposed architectures only consider the textual content appearing in a query-advertisement pair as input, and produce as output a click-through rate prediction. By comparing the character-level model with the word-level model, we show that language representation can be learnt from scratch at character level when trained on enough data. Through extensive experiments using billions of query-advertisement pairs of a popular commercial search engine, we demonstrate that both approaches significantly outperform a baseline model built on well-selected text features and a state-of-the-art word2vec-based approach. Finally, by combining the predictions of the deep models introduced in this study with the prediction of the model in production of the same commercial search engine, we significantly improve the accuracy and the calibration of the click-through rate prediction of the production system."

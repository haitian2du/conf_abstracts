Word-Entity Duet Representations for Document Ranking,"This paper presents a word-entity duet framework for utilizing knowledge bases in ad-hoc retrieval. In this work, the query and documents are modeled by word-based representations and entity-based representations. Ranking features are generated by the interactions between the two representations, incorporating information from the word space, the entity space, and the cross-space connections through the knowledge graph. To handle the uncertainties from the automatically constructed entity representations, an attention-based ranking model AttR-Duet is developed. With back-propagation from ranking labels, the model learns simultaneously how to demote noisy entities and how to rank documents with the word-entity duet. Evaluation results on TREC Web Track ad-hoc task demonstrate that all of the four-way interactions in the duet are useful, the attention mechanism successfully steers the model away from noisy entities, and together they significantly outperform both word-based and entity-based learning to rank systems."
Dynamic Factual Summaries for Entity Cards,"Entity cards are being used frequently in modern web search engines to offer a concise overview of an entity directly on the results page. These cards are composed of various elements, one of them being the entity summary: a selection of facts describing the entity from an underlying knowledge base. These summaries, while presenting a synopsis of the entity, can also directly address users' information needs. In this paper, we make the first effort towards generating and evaluating such factual summaries. We introduce and address the novel problem of dynamic entity summarization for entity cards, and break it down to two specific subtasks: fact ranking and summary generation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using crowdsourcing. Our results show the effectiveness of our fact ranking approach and validate that users prefer dynamic summaries over static ones."
MEmbER: Max-Margin Based Embeddings for Entity Retrieval,"We propose a new class of methods for learning vector space embeddings of entities. While most existing methods focus on modelling similarity, our primary aim is to learn embeddings that are interpretable, in the sense that query terms have a direct geometric representation in the vector space. Intuitively, we want all entities that have some property (i.e. for which a given term is relevant) to be located in some well-defined region of the space. This is achieved by imposing max-margin constraints that are derived from a bag-of-words representation of the entities. The resulting vector spaces provide us with a natural vehicle for identifying entities that have a given property (or ranking them according to how much they have the property), and conversely, to describe what a given set of entities have in common. As we show in our experiments, our models lead to a substantially better performance in a range of entity-oriented search tasks, such as list completion and entity ranking."

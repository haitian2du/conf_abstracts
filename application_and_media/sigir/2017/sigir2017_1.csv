Navigating Imprecision in Relevance Assessments on the Road to Total Recall: Roger and Me,"Technology-assisted review (""TAR"") systems seek to achieve ""total recall""; that is, to approach, as nearly as possible, the ideal of 100% recall and 100% precision, while minimizing human review effort. The literature reports that TAR methods using relevance feedback can achieve considerably greater than the 65% recall and 65% precision reported by Voorhees as the ""practical upper bound on retrieval performance... since that is the level at which humans agree with one another"" (Variations in Relevance Judgments and the Measurement of Retrieval Effectiveness, 2000). This work argues that in order to build - as well as to, evaluate - TAR systems that approach 100% recall and 100% precision, it is necessary to model human assessment, not as absolute ground truth, but as an indirect indicator of the amorphous property known as ""relevance."" The choice of model impacts both the evaluation of system effectiveness, as well as the simulation of relevance feedback. Models are presented that better fit available data than the infallible ground-truth model. These models suggest ways to improve TAR-system effectiveness so that hybrid human-computer systems can improve on both the accuracy and efficiency of human review alone. This hypothesis is tested by simulating TAR using two datasets: the TREC 4 AdHoc collection, and a dataset consisting of 401,960 email messages that were manually reviewed and classified by a single individual, Roger, in his official capacity as Senior State Records Archivist. The results using the TREC 4 data show that TAR achieves higher recall and higher precision than the assessments by either of two independent NIST assessors, and blind adjudication of the email dataset, conducted by Roger, more than two years after his original review, shows that he could have achieved the same recall and better precision, while reviewing substantially fewer than 401,960 emails, had he employed TAR in place of exhaustive manual review."
Meta-evaluation of Online and Offline Web Search Evaluation Metrics,"As in most information retrieval (IR) studies, evaluation plays an essential part in Web search research. Both offline and online evaluation metrics are adopted in measuring the performance of search engines. Offline metrics are usually based on relevance judgments of query-document pairs from assessors while online metrics exploit the user behavior data, such as clicks, collected from search engines to compare search algorithms. Although both types of IR evaluation metrics have achieved success, to what extent can they predict user satisfaction still remains under-investigated. To shed light on this research question, we meta-evaluate a series of existing online and offline metrics to study how well they infer actual search user satisfaction in different search scenarios. We find that both types of evaluation metrics significantly correlate with user satisfaction while they reflect satisfaction from different perspectives for different search tasks. Offline metrics better align with user satisfaction in homogeneous search (i.e. ten blue links) whereas online metrics outperform when vertical results are federated. Finally, we also propose to incorporate mouse hover information into existing online evaluation metrics, and empirically show that they better align with search user satisfaction than click-based online metrics."
"The Probability that Your Hypothesis Is Correct, Credible Intervals, and Effect Sizes for IR Evaluation","Using classical statistical significance tests, researchers can only discuss P(D+|H), the probability of observing the data D at hand or something more extreme, under the assumption that the hypothesis H is true (i.e., the p-value). But what we usually want is P(H|D), the probability that a hypothesis is true, given the data. If we use Bayesian statistics with state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for obtaining posterior distributions, this is no longer a problem. That is, instead of the classical p-values and 95% confidence intervals, which are often misinterpreted respectively as ""probability that the hypothesis is (in)correct"" and ""probability that the true parameter value drops within the interval is 95%,"" we can easily obtain P(H|D) and credible intervals which represent exactly the above. Moreover, with Bayesian tests, we can easily handle virtually any hypothesis, not just ""equality of means,"" and obtain an Expected A Posteriori (EAP) value of any statistic that we are interested in. We provide simple tools to encourage the IR community to take up paired and unpaired Bayesian tests for comparing two systems. Using a variety of TREC and NTCIR data, we compare P(H|D) with p-values, credible intervals with confidence intervals, and Bayesian EAP effect sizes with classical ones. Our results show that (a) p-values and confidence intervals can respectively be regarded as approximations of what we really want, namely, P(H|D) and credible intervals; and (b) sample effect sizes from classical significance tests can differ considerably from the Bayesian EAP effect sizes, which suggests that the former can be poor estimates of population effect sizes. For both paired and unpaired tests, we propose that the IR community report the EAP, the credible interval, and the probability of hypothesis being true, not only for the raw difference in means but also for the effect size in terms of Glass's Î”."
Can Deep Effectiveness Metrics Be Evaluated Using Shallow Judgment Pools?,"Increasing test collection sizes and limited judgment budgets create measurement challenges for IR batch evaluations, challenges that are greater when using deep effectiveness metrics than when using shallow metrics, because of the increased likelihood that unjudged documents will be encountered. Here we study the problem of metric score adjustment, with the goal of accurately estimating system performance when using deep metrics and limited judgment sets, assuming that dynamic score adjustment is required per topic due to the variability in the number of relevant documents. We seek to induce system orderings that are as close as is possible to the orderings that would arise if full judgments were available. Starting with depth-based pooling, and no prior knowledge of sampling probabilities, the first phase of our two-stage process computes a background gain for each document based on rank-level statistics. The second stage then accounts for the distributional variance of relevant documents. We also exploit the frequency statistics of pooled relevant documents in order to determine a threshold for dynamically determining the set of topics to be adjusted. Taken together, our results show that: (i) better score estimates can be achieved when compared to previous work; (ii) by setting a global threshold, we are able to adapt our methods to different collections; and (iii) the proposed estimation methods reliably approximate the system orderings achieved when many more relevance judgments are available. We also consider pools generated by a two-strata sampling approach."

Deep Semantic Hashing with Generative Adversarial Networks,"Hashing has been a widely-adopted technique for nearest neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can lead to high quality hashing. However, the cost of annotating data is often an obstacle when applying supervised hashing to a new domain. Moreover, the results can suffer from the robustness problem as the data at training and test stage may come from different distributions. This paper studies the exploration of generating synthetic data through semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), which leverages largely unlabeled and limited labeled training data to produce highly compelling data with intrinsic invariance and global coherence, for better understanding statistical structures of natural data. We demonstrate that the above two limitations can be well mitigated by applying the synthetic data for hashing. Specifically, a novel deep semantic hashing with GANs (DSH-GANs) is presented, which mainly consists of four components: a deep convolution neural networks (CNN) for learning image representations, an adversary stream to distinguish synthetic images from real ones, a hash stream for encoding image representations to hash codes and a classification stream. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing three losses, i.e., adversarial loss to correct label of synthetic or real for each sample, triplet ranking loss to preserve the relative similarity ordering in the input real-synthetic triplets and classification loss to classify each sample accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE image benchmarks validate the capability of exploiting synthetic images for hashing. Our framework also achieves superior results when compared to state-of-the-art deep hash models."
Characterizing and Predicting Enterprise Email Reply Behavior,"Email is still among the most popular online activities. People spend a significant amount of time sending, reading and responding to email in order to communicate with others, manage tasks and archive personal information. Most previous research on email is based on either relatively small data samples from user surveys and interviews, or on consumer email accounts such as those from Yahoo! Mail or Gmail. Much less has been published on how people interact with enterprise email even though it contains less automatically generated commercial email and involves more organizational behavior than is evident in personal accounts. In this paper, we extend previous work on predicting email reply behavior by looking at enterprise settings and considering more than dyadic communications. We characterize the influence of various factors such as email content and metadata, historical interaction features and temporal features on email reply behavior. We also develop models to predict whether a recipient will reply to an email and how long it will take to do so. Experiments with the publicly-available Avocado email collection show that our methods outperform all baselines with large gains. We also analyze the importance of different features on reply behavior predictions. Our findings provide new insights about how people interact with enterprise email and have implications for the design of the next generation of email clients."
ReAct: Online Multimodal Embedding for Recency-Aware Spatiotemporal Activity Modeling,"Spatiotemporalactivity modeling is an important task for applications like tour recommendation and place search. The recently developed geographical topic models have demonstrated compelling results in using geo-tagged social media (GTSM) for spatiotemporal activity modeling. Nevertheless, they all operate in batch and cannot dynamically accommodate the latest information in the GTSM stream to reveal up-to-date spatiotemporal activities. We propose ReAct, a method that processes continuous GTSM streams and obtains recency-aware spatiotemporal activity models on the fly. Distinguished from existing topic-based methods, ReAct embeds all the regions, hours, and keywords into the same latent space to capture their correlations. To generate high-quality embeddings, it adopts a novel semi-supervised multimodal embedding paradigm that leverages the activity category information to guide the embedding process. Furthermore, as new records arrive continuously, it employs strategies to effectively incorporate the new information while preserving the knowledge encoded in previous embeddings. Our experiments on the geo-tagged tweet streams in two major cities have shown that ReAct significantly outperforms existing methods for location and activity retrieval tasks."
EntiTables: Smart Assistance for Entity-Focused Tables,"Tables are among the most powerful and practical tools for organizing and working with data. Our motivation is to equip spreadsheet programs with smart assistance capabilities. We concentrate on one particular family of tables, namely, tables with an entity focus. We introduce and focus on two specifc tasks: populating rows with additional instances (entities) and populating columns with new headings. We develop generative probabilistic models for both tasks. For estimating the components of these models, we consider a knowledge base as well as a large table corpus. Our experimental evaluation simulates the various stages of the user entering content into an actual table. A detailed analysis of the results shows that the models' components are complimentary and that our methods outperform existing approaches from the literature."

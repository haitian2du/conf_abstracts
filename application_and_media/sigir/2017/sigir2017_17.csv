Joint Learning of Response Ranking and Next Utterance Suggestion in Human-Computer Conversation System,"Conversation systems are of growing importance since they enable an easy interaction interface between humans and computers: using natural languages. To build a conversation system with adequate intelligence is challenging, and requires abundant resources including an acquisition of big data and interdisciplinary techniques, such as information retrieval and natural language processing. Along with the prosperity of Web 2.0, the massive data available greatly facilitate data-driven methods such as deep learning for human-computer conversation systems. Owing to the diversity of Web resources, a retrieval-based conversation system will come up with at least some results from the immense repository for any user inputs. Given a human issued message, i.e., query, a traditional conversation system would provide a response after adequate training and learning of how to respond. In this paper, we propose a new task for conversation systems: joint learning of response ranking featured with next utterance suggestion. We assume that the new conversation mode is more proactive and keeps user engaging. We examine the assumption in experiments. Besides, to address the joint learning task, we propose a novel Dual-LSTM Chain Model to couple response ranking and next utterance suggestion simultaneously. From the experimental results, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed task and the effectiveness of the proposed model."
Learning to Rank Question Answer Pairs with Holographic Dual LSTM Architecture,"We describe a new deep learning architecture for learning to rank question answer pairs. Our approach extends the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with holographic composition to model the relationship between question and answer representations. As opposed to the neural tensor layer that has been adopted recently, the holographic composition provides the benefits of scalable and rich representational learning approach without incurring huge parameter costs. Overall, we present Holographic Dual LSTM (HD-LSTM), a unified architecture for both deep sentence modeling and semantic matching. Essentially, our model is trained end-to-end whereby the parameters of the LSTM are optimized in a way that best explains the correlation between question and answer representations. In addition, our proposed deep learning architecture requires no extensive feature engineering. Via extensive experiments, we show that HD-LSTM outperforms many other neural architectures on two popular benchmark QA datasets. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of holographic composition over the neural tensor layer."
Incomplete Follow-up Question Resolution using Retrieval based Sequence to Sequence Learning,"Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) and interactive question answering (IQA) systems frequently encounter incomplete follow-up questions. The incomplete follow-up questions only make sense when seen in conjunction with the conversation context: the previous question and answer. Thus, IQA and IPA systems need to utilize the conversation context in order to handle the incomplete follow-up questions and generate an appropriate response. In this work, we present a retrieval based sequence to sequence learning system that can generate the complete (or intended) question for an incomplete follow-up question (given the conversation context). We can train our system using only a small labeled dataset (with only a few thousand conversations), by decomposing the original problem into two simpler and independent problems. The first problem focuses solely on selecting the candidate complete questions from a library of question templates (built offline using the small labeled conversations dataset). In the second problem, we re-rank the selected candidate questions using a neural language model (trained on millions of unlabelled questions independently). Our system can achieve a BLEU score of 42.91, as compared to 29.11 using an existing generation based approach. We further demonstrate the utility of our system as a plug-in module to an existing QA pipeline. Our system when added as a plug-in module, enables Siri to achieve an improvement of 131.57% in answering incomplete follow-up questions."
Modelling Information Needs in Collaborative Search Conversations,"The increase of voice-based interaction has changed the way people seek information, making search more conversational. Development of effective conversational approaches to search requires better understanding of how people express information needs in dialogue. This paper describes the creation and examination of over 32K spoken utterances collected during 34 hours of collaborative search tasks. The contribution of this work is three-fold. First, we propose a model of conversational information needs (CINs) based on a synthesis of relevant theories in Information Seeking and Retrieval. Second, we show several behavioural patterns of CINs based on the proposed model. Third, we identify effective feature groups that may be useful for detecting CINs categories from conversations. This paper concludes with a discussion of how these findings can facilitate advance of conversational search applications."

Privacy-aware Document Ranking with Neural Signals,"The recent work on neural ranking has achieved solid relevance improvement, by exploring similarities between documents and queries using word embeddings. It is an open problem how to leverage such an advancement for privacy-aware ranking, which is important for top K document search on the cloud. Since neural ranking adds more complexity in score computation, it is difficult to prevent the server from discovering embedding-based semantic features and inferring privacy-sensitive information. This paper analyzes the critical leakages in interaction-based neural ranking and studies countermeasures to mitigate such a leakage. It proposes a privacy-aware neural ranking scheme that integrates tree ensembles with kernel value obfuscation and a soft match map based on adaptively-clustered term closures. The paper also presents an evaluation with two TREC datasets on the relevance of the proposed techniques and the trade-offs for privacy and storage efficiency."
Legal Intelligence for E-commerce: Multi-task Learning by Leveraging Multiview Dispute Representation,"Various e-commerce platforms produce millions of transactions per day with many transaction disputes. This generates the demand for effective and efficient dispute resolutions for e-commerce transactions. This paper proposes a novel research task of Legal Dispute Judgment (LDJ) prediction for e-commerce transactions, which connects two yet isolated domains, e-commerce data mining and legal intelligence. Different from traditional legal intelligence with the focus on textual evidence of the dispute itself, the new research utilizes multiview information such as past behavior information of seller and buyer as well as textual evidence of the current transaction. The multiview dispute representation is integrated into an innovative multi-task learning framework for predicting the legal result. An extensive set of experiments with a large dispute case dataset collected from a world leading e-commerce platform shows that the proposed model can more accurately characterize a dispute case through buyer, seller, and transaction viewpoints for legal judgment prediction against several alternatives."
Hierarchical Matching Network for Crime Classification,"Automatic crime classification is a fundamental task in the legal field. Given the fact descriptions, judges first determine the relevant violated laws, and then the articles. As laws and articles are grouped into a tree-shaped hierarchy (i.e., laws as parent labels, articles as children labels), this task can be naturally formalized as a two layers' hierarchical multi-label classification problem. Generally, the label semantics (i.e., definition of articles) and the hierarchical structure are two informative properties for judges to make a correct decision. However, most previous methods usually ignore the label structure and feed all labels into a flat classification framework, or neglect the label semantics and only utilize fact descriptions for crime classification, thus the performance may be limited. In this paper, we formalize crime classification problem into a matching task to address these issues. We name our model as Hierarchical Matching Network (HMN for short). Based on the tree hierarchy, HMN explicitly decomposes the semantics of children labels into the residual and alignment components. The residual components keep the unique characteristics of each individual children label, while the alignment components capture the common semantics among sibling children labels, which are further aggregated as the representation of their parent label. Finally, given a fact description, a co-attention metric is applied to effectively match the relevant laws and articles. Experiments on two real-world judicial datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods."
Learning from Fact-checkers: Analysis and Generation of Fact-checking Language,"In fighting against fake news, many fact-checking systems comprised of human-based fact-checking sites (e.g., snopes.com and politifact.com) and automatic detection systems have been developed in recent years. However, online users still keep sharing fake news even when it has been debunked. It means that early fake news detection may be insufficient and we need another complementary approach to mitigate the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of text generation for combating fake news. In particular, we (1) leverage online users named fact-checkers, who cite fact-checking sites as credible evidences to fact-check information in public discourse; (2) analyze linguistic characteristics of fact-checking tweets; and (3) propose and build a deep learning framework to generate responses with fact-checking intention to increase the fact-checkers' engagement in fact-checking activities. Our analysis reveals that the fact-checkers tend to refute misinformation and use formal language (e.g. few swear words and Internet slangs). Our framework successfully generates relevant responses, and outperforms competing models by achieving up to 30% improvements. Our qualitative study also confirms that the superiority of our generated responses compared with responses generated from the existing models."

An Efficient Adaptive Transfer Neural Network for Social-aware Recommendation,"Many previous studies attempt to utilize information from other domains to achieve better performance of recommendation. Recently, social information has been shown effective in improving recommendation results with transfer learning frameworks, and the transfer part helps to learn users' preferences from both item domain and social domain. However, two vital issues have not been well-considered in existing methods: 1) Usually, a static transfer scheme is adopted to share a user's common preference between item and social domains, which is not robust in real life where the degrees of sharing and information richness are varied for different users. Hence a non-personalized transfer scheme may be insufficient and unsuccessful. 2) Most previous neural recommendation methods rely on negative sampling in training to increase computational efficiency, which makes them highly sensitive to sampling strategies and hence difficult to achieve optimal results in practical applications."
A Neural Influence Diffusion Model for Social Recommendation,"Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users, with these trusted users are influenced by the trusted users' social connections. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could be applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than 13% performance improvements over the best baselines for top-10 recommendation on the two datasets."
Adversarial Mahalanobis Distance-based Attentive Song Recommender for Automatic Playlist Continuation,"In this paper, we aim to solve the automatic playlist continuation (APC) problem by modeling complex interactions among users, playlists, and songs using only their interaction data. Prior methods mainly rely on dot product to account for similarities, which is not ideal as dot product is not metric learning, so it does not convey the important inequality property. Based on this observation, we propose three novel deep learning approaches that utilize Mahalanobis distance. Our first approach uses user-playlist-song interactions, and combines Mahalanobis distance scores between (i) a target user and a target song, and (ii) between a target playlist and the target song to account for both the user's preference and the playlist's theme. Our second approach measures song-song similarities by considering Mahalanobis distance scores between the target song and each member song (i.e., existing song) in the target playlist. The contribution of each distance score is measured by our proposed memory metric-based attention mechanism. In the third approach, we fuse the two previous models into a unified model to further enhance their performance. In addition, we adopt and customize Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR) for our three approaches to further improve their robustness and predictive capabilities. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed models outperform eight state-of-the-art models in two large-scale real-world datasets."
Interact and Decide: Medley of Sub-Attention Networks for Effective Group Recommendation,"This paper proposes Medley of Sub-Attention Networks (MoSAN), a new novel neural architecture for the group recommendation task. Group-level recommendation is known to be a challenging task, in which intricate group dynamics have to be considered. As such, this is to be contrasted with the standard recommendation problem where recommendations are personalized with respect to a single user. Our proposed approach hinges upon the key intuition that the decision making process (in groups) is generally dynamic, i.e., a user's decision is highly dependent on the other group members. All in all, our key motivation manifests in a form of an attentive neural model that captures fine-grained interactions between group members. In our MoSAN model, each sub-attention module is representative of a single member, which models a user's preference with respect to all other group members. Subsequently, a Medley of Sub-Attention modules is then used to collectively make the group's final decision. Overall, our proposed model is both expressive and effective. Via a series of extensive experiments, we show that MoSAN not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also improves standard baselines by a considerable margin."

Health Cards for Consumer Health Search,"This paper investigates the impact of health cards in consumer health search (CHS) - people seeking health advice online. Health cards are a concise presentations of a health concept shown along side search results to specific health queries; they have the potential to convey health information in easily digestible form for the general public. However, little evidence exists on how effective health cards actually are for users when searching health advice online, and whether their effectiveness is limited to specific health search intents. To understand the impact of health cards on CHS, we conducted a laboratory study to observe users completing CHS tasks using two search interface variants: one just with result snippets and one containing both result snippets and health cards. Our study makes the following contributions: (1) it reveals how and when health cards are beneficial to users in completing consumer health search tasks, and (2) it identifies the features of health cards that helped users in completing their tasks. This is the first study that thoroughly investigates the effectiveness of health cards in supporting consumer health search."
Hate Speech Detection is Not as Easy as You May Think: A Closer Look at Model Validation,"Hate speech is an important problem that is seriously affecting the dynamics and usefulness of online social communities. Large scale social platforms are currently investing important resources into automatically detecting and classifying hateful content, without much success. On the other hand, the results reported by state-of-the-art systems indicate that supervised approaches achieve almost perfect performance but only within specific datasets. In this work, we analyze this apparent contradiction between existing literature and actual applications. We study closely the experimental methodology used in prior work and their generalizability to other datasets. Our findings evidence methodological issues, as well as an important dataset bias. As a consequence, performance claims of the current state-of-the-art have become significantly overestimated. The problems that we have found are mostly related to data overfitting and sampling issues. We discuss the implications for current research and re-conduct experiments to give a more accurate picture of the current state-of-the art methods."
Harvesting Drug Effectiveness from Social Media,"Drug effectiveness describes the capacity of a drug to cure a disease, which is of great importance for drug safety. To get this information, a number of real-world patient-oriented outcomes are required. However, current surveillance systems can only capture a small portion of them, and there is a time lag in processing the reported data. Since social media provides quantities of patient-oriented user posts in real-time, it is of great value to automatically extract drug effectiveness from these data. To this end, we build a dataset containing 25K tweets describing drug use, and further harvest drug effectiveness by performing Relation Extraction (RE) between chemicals and diseases. Most prior works about RE deal with mention pairs independently, which is not suitable for our task since interactions across mention pairs are widespread. In this paper, we propose a model regarding mention pairs as nodes connected by multiple types of edges. With the help of graph-based information transfers over time, it deals with all mention pairs simultaneously to capture their interactions. Besides, a novel idea is used to perform multiple instance learning, a big challenge in general RE tasks. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms previous work by a substantial margin."

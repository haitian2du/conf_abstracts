CROSS: Cross-platform Recommendation for Social E-Commerce,"Social e-commerce, as a new concept of e-commerce, uses social media as a new prevalent platform for online shopping. Users are now able to view, add to cart, and buy products within a single social media app. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-platform recommendation for social e-commerce, i.e., recommending products to users when they are shopping through social media. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new and important problem for all e-commerce companies (e.g. Amazon, Alibaba), but has never been studied before."
Hot Topic-Aware Retweet Prediction with Masked Self-attentive Model,"Social media users create millions of microblog entries on various topics each day. Retweet behaviour play a crucial role in spreading topics on social media. Retweet prediction task has received considerable attention in recent years. The majority of existing retweet prediction methods are focus on modeling user preference by utilizing various information, such as user profiles, user post history, user following relationships, etc. Yet, the users exposures towards real-time posting from their followees contribute significantly to making retweet predictions, considering that the users may participate into the hot topics discussed by their followees rather than be limited to their previous interests. To make efficient use of hot topics, we propose a novel masked self-attentive model to perform the retweet prediction task by perceiving the hot topics discussed by the users' followees. We incorporate the posting histories of users with external memory and utilize a hierarchical attention mechanism to construct the users' interests. Hence, our model can be jointly hot-topic aware and user interests aware to make a final prediction. Experimental results on a dataset collected from Twitter demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods."
Mention Recommendation in Twitter with Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"In Twitter-like social networking services, the ""@'' symbol can be used with the tweet to mention users whom the user wants to alert regarding the message. An automatic suggestion to the user of a small list of candidate names can improve communication efficiency. Previous work usually used several most recent tweets or randomly select historical tweets to make an inference about this preferred list of names. However, because there are too many historical tweets by users and a wide variety of content types, the use of several tweets cannot guarantee the desired results. In this work, we propose the use of a novel cooperative multi-agent approach to mention recommendation, which incorporates dozens of more historical tweets than earlier approaches. The proposed method can effectively select a small set of historical tweets and cooperatively extract relevant indicator tweets from both the user and mentioned users. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
Online User Representation Learning Across Heterogeneous Social Networks,"Accurate user representation learning has been proven fundamental for many social media applications, including community detection, recommendation, etc. A major challenge lies in that, the available data in a single social network are usually very limited and sparse. In real life, many people are members of several social networks in the same time. Constrained by the features and design of each, any single social platform offers only a partial view of a user from a particular perspective. In this paper, we propose MV-URL, a multi-view user representation learning model to enhance user modeling by integrating the knowledge from various networks. Different from the traditional network embedding frameworks where either the whole framework is single-network based or each network involved is a homogeneous network, we focus on multiple social networks and each network in our task is a heterogeneous network. It's very challenging to effectively fuse knowledge in this setting as the fusion depends upon not only the varying relatedness of information sources, but also the target application tasks. MV-URL focuses on two tasks: user account linkage (i.e., to predict the missing true user account linkage across social media) and user attribute prediction. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on two real-world collections of linked social networks, and the experimental results show the superiority of MV-URL compared with existing state-of-art embedding methods. It can be learned online, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for real world applications."

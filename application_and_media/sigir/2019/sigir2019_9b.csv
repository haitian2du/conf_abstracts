Teach Machine How to Read: Reading Behavior Inspired Relevance Estimation,"Retrieval models aim to estimate the relevance of a document to a certain query. Although existing retrieval models have gained much success in both deepening our understanding of information seeking behavior and constructing practical retrieval systems (e.g. Web search engines), we have to admit that the models work in a rather different manner than how humans make relevance judgments. In this paper, we aim to reexamine the existing models as well as to propose new ones based on the findings in how human read documents during relevance judgment. First, we summarize a number of reading heuristics from practical user behavior patterns, which are categorized into implicit and explicit heuristics. By reviewing a variety of existing retrieval models, we find that most of them only satisfy a part of these reading heuristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of each heuristic, we conduct an ablation study and find that most heuristics have positive impacts on retrieval performance. We further integrate all the effective heuristics into a new retrieval model named Reading Inspired Model (RIM). Specifically, implicit reading heuristics are incorporated into the model framework and explicit reading heuristics are modeled as a Markov Decision Process and learned by reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale public available benchmark dataset and two test sets from NTCIR WWW tasks show that RIM outperforms most existing models, which illustrates the effectiveness of the reading heuristics. We believe that this work contributes to constructing retrieval models with both higher retrieval performance and better explainability."
Improving the Accuracy of System Performance Estimation by Using Shards,"We improve the measurement accuracy of retrieval system performance by better modeling the noise present in test collection scores. Our technique draws its inspiration from two approaches: one, which exploits the variable measurement accuracy of topics; the other, which randomly splits document collections into shards. We describe and theoretically analyze an ANOVA model able to capture the effects of topics, systems, and document shards as well as their interactions. Using multiple TREC collections, we empirically confirm theoretical results in terms of improved estimation accuracy and robustness of found significant differences. The improvements compared to widely used test collection measurement techniques are substantial. We speculate that our technique works because we do not assume that the topics of a test collection measure performance equally."
Fast Approximate Filtering of Search Results Sorted by Attribute,"Several Web search services enable their users with the possibility of sorting the list of results by a specific attribute, e.g., sort ""by price"" in e-commerce. However, sorting the results by attribute could bring marginally relevant results in the top positions thus leading to a poor user experience. This motivates the definition of the relevance-aware filtering problem. This problem asks to remove results from the attribute-sorted list to maximize its final overall relevance. Recently, an optimal solution to this problem has been proposed. However, it has strong limitations in the Web scenario due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose ϵ-Filtering: an efficient approximate algorithm with strong approximation guarantees on the relevance of the final list. More precisely, given an allowed approximation error ϵ, the proposed algorithm finds a(1-ϵ)""optimal filtering, i.e., the relevance of its solution is at least (1-ϵ) times the optimum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ϵ-Filtering against state-of-the-art competitors on two real-world public datasets. Experiments show that ϵ-Filtering achieves the desired levels of effectiveness with a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude with respect to the optimal solution while guaranteeing very small approximation errors."

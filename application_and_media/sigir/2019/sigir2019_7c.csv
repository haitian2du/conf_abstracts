Bayesian Personalized Feature Interaction Selection for Factorization Machines,"Factorization Machines (FMs) are widely used for feature-based collaborative filtering tasks, as they are very effective at modeling feature interactions. Existing FM-based methods usually take all feature interactions into account, which is unreasonable because not all feature interactions are helpful: incorporating useless feature interactions will introduce noise and degrade the recommendation performance. Recently, methods that perform Feature Interaction Selection (FIS) have attracted attention because of their effectiveness at filtering out useless feature interactions. However, they assume that all users share the same feature interactions, which is not necessarily true, especially for collaborative filtering tasks. In this work, we address this issue and study Personalized Feature Interaction Selection (P-FIS) by proposing a Bayesian Personalized Feature Interaction Selection (BP-FIS) mechanism under the Bayesian Variable Selection (BVS) theory. Specifically, we first introduce interaction selection variables with hereditary spike and slab priors for P-FIS. Then, we form a Bayesian generative model and derive the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), which can be optimized by an efficient Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) method to learn the parameters. Finally, because BP-FIS can be seamlessly integrated with different variants of FMs, we implement two FM variants under the proposed BP-FIS. We carry out experiments on three benchmark datasets. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of BP-FIS for selecting personalized interactions and improving the recommendation performance."
CTRec: A Long-Short Demands Evolution Model for Continuous-Time Recommendation,"In e-commerce, users' demands are not only conditioned by their profile and preferences, but also by their recent purchases that may generate new demands, as well as periodical demands that depend on purchases made some time ago. We call them respectively short-term demands and long-term demands. In this paper, we propose a novel self-attentive Continuous-Time Recommendation model (CTRec) for capturing the evolving demands of users over time. For modeling such time-sensitive demands, a Demand-aware Hawkes Process (DHP) framework is designed in CTRec to learn from the discrete purchase records of users. More specifically, a convolutional neural network is utilized to capture the short-term demands; and a self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the periodical purchase cycles of long-term demands. All types of demands are fused in DHP to make final continuous-time recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world commercial datasets to demonstrate that CTRec is effective for general sequential recommendation problems, including next-item and next-session/basket recommendations. We observe in particular that CTRec is capable of learning the purchase cycles of products and estimating the purchase time of a product given a user."
Ï€-Net: A Parallel Information-sharing Network for Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendations,"Sequential Recommendation (SR) is the task of recommending the next item based on a sequence of recorded user behaviors. We study SR in a particularly challenging context, in which multiple individual users share a single account (shared-account) and in which user behaviors are available in multiple domains (cross-domain). These characteristics bring new challenges on top of those of the traditional SR task. On the one hand, we need to identify different user behaviors under the same account in order to recommend the right item to the right user at the right time. On the other hand, we need to discriminate the behaviors from one domain that might be helpful to improve recommendations in the other domains."
Warm Up Cold-start Advertisements: Improving CTR Predictions via Learning to Learn ID Embeddings,"Click-through rate (CTR) prediction has been one of the most central problems in computational advertising. Lately, embedding techniques that produce low-dimensional representations of ad IDs drastically improve CTR prediction accuracies. However, such learning techniques are data demanding and work poorly on new ads with little logging data, which is known as the cold-start problem."

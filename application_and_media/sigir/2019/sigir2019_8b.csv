Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption,"Multi-modal hashing is an effective technique to support large-scale multimedia retrieval, due to its capability of encoding heterogeneous multi-modal features into compact and similarity-preserving binary codes. Although great progress has been achieved so far, existing methods still suffer from several problems, including: 1) All existing methods simply adopt fixed modality combination weights in online hashing process to generate the query hash codes. This strategy cannot adaptively capture the variations of different queries. 2) They either suffer from insufficient semantics (for unsupervised methods) or require high computation and storage cost (for the supervised methods, which rely on pair-wise semantic matrix). 3) They solve the hash codes with relaxed optimization strategy or bit-by-bit discrete optimization, which results in significant quantization loss or consumes considerable computation time. To address the above limitations, in this paper, we propose an Online Multi-modal Hashing with Dynamic Query-adaption (OMH-DQ) method in a novel fashion. Specifically, a self-weighted fusion strategy is designed to adaptively preserve the multi-modal feature information into hash codes by exploiting their complementarity. The hash codes are learned with the supervision of pair-wise semantic labels to enhance their discriminative capability, while avoiding the challenging symmetric similarity matrix factorization. Under such learning framework, the binary hash codes can be directly obtained with efficient operations and without quantization errors. Accordingly, our method can benefit from the semantic labels, and simultaneously, avoid the high computation complexity. Moreover, to accurately capture the query variations, at the online retrieval stage, we design a parameter-free online hashing module which can adaptively learn the query hash codes according to the dynamic query contents. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach from various aspects."
Supervised Hierarchical Cross-Modal Hashing,"Recently, due to the unprecedented growth of multimedia data, cross-modal hashing has gained increasing attention for the efficient cross-media retrieval. Typically, existing methods on cross-modal hashing treat labels of one instance independently but overlook the correlations among labels. Indeed, in many real-world scenarios, like the online fashion domain, instances (items) are labeled with a set of categories correlated by certain hierarchy. In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end solution for supervised cross-modal hashing, named HiCHNet, which explicitly exploits the hierarchical labels of instances. In particular, by the pre-established label hierarchy, we comprehensively characterize each modality of the instance with a set of layer-wise hash representations. In essence, hash codes are encouraged to not only preserve the layer-wise semantic similarities encoded by the label hierarchy, but also retain the hierarchical discriminative capabilities. Due to the lack of benchmark datasets, apart from adapting the existing dataset FashionVC from fashion domain, we create a dataset from the online fashion platform Ssense consisting of 15,696 image-text pairs labeled by 32 hierarchical categories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods."
Unsupervised Neural Generative Semantic Hashing,"Fast similarity search is a key component in large-scale information retrieval, where semantic hashing has become a popular strategy for representing documents as binary hash codes. Recent advances in this area have been obtained through neural network based models: generative models trained by learning to reconstruct the original documents. We present a novel unsupervised generative semantic hashing approach, Ranking based Semantic Hashing (RBSH) that consists of both a variational and a ranking based component. Similarly to variational autoencoders, the variational component is trained to reconstruct the original document conditioned on its generated hash code, and as in prior work, it only considers documents individually. The ranking component solves this limitation by incorporating inter-document similarity into the hash code generation, modelling document ranking through a hinge loss. To circumvent the need for labelled data to compute the hinge loss, we use a weak labeller and thus keep the approach fully unsupervised."

Accelerated Query Processing Via Similarity Score Prediction,"Processing top-k bag-of-words queries is critical to many information retrieval applications, including web-scale search. In this work, we consider algorithmic properties associated with dynamic pruning mechanisms. Such algorithms maintain a score threshold (the k th highest similarity score identified so far) so that low-scoring documents can be bypassed, allowing fast top-k retrieval with no loss in effectiveness. In standard pruning algorithms the score threshold is initialized to the lowest possible value. To accelerate processing, we make use of term- and query-dependent features to predict the final value of that threshold, and then employ the predicted value right from the commencement of processing. Because of the asymmetry associated with prediction errors (if the estimated threshold is too high the query will need to be re-executed in order to assure the correct answer), the prediction process must be risk-sensitive. We explore techniques for balancing those factors, and provide detailed experimental results that show the practical usefulness of the new approach."
Optimal Freshness Crawl Under Politeness Constraints,"A Web crawler is an essential part of a search engine that procures information subsequently served by the search engine to its users. As the Web is becoming increasingly more dynamic, in addition to discovering new web pages a crawler needs to keep revisiting those already in the search engine's index, in order to keep the index fresh by picking up the pages' changed content. Determining how often to recrawl pages requires making tradeoffs based on the pages' relative importance and change rates, subject to multiple resource constraints - the limited daily budget of crawl requests on the search engine's end and politeness constraints restricting the rate at which pages can be requested from a given host. In this paper, we introduce PoliteBinaryLambdaCrawl, the first optimal algorithm for freshness crawl scheduling in the presence of politeness constraints as well as non-uniform page importance scores and the crawler's own crawl request limit. We also propose an approximation for it, stating its theoretical optimality conditions and in the process discovering a connection to an approach previously thought of as a mere heuristic for freshness crawl scheduling. We explore the relative performance of PoliteBinaryLambdaCrawl and other methods for handling politeness constraints on a dataset collected by crawling over 18.5M URLs daily over 14 weeks."
"Statistical Significance Testing in Information Retrieval: An Empirical Analysis of Type I, Type II and Type III Errors","Statistical significance testing is widely accepted as a means to assess how well a difference in effectiveness reflects an actual difference between systems, as opposed to random noise because of the selection of topics. According to recent surveys on SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR and TOIS papers, the t-test is the most popular choice among IR researchers. However, previous work has suggested computer intensive tests like the bootstrap or the permutation test, based mainly on theoretical arguments. On empirical grounds, others have suggested non-parametric alternatives such as the Wilcoxon test. Indeed, the question of which tests we should use has accompanied IR and related fields for decades now. Previous theoretical studies on this matter were limited in that we know that test assumptions are not met in IR experiments, and empirical studies were limited in that we do not have the necessary control over the null hypotheses to compute actual Type I and Type II error rates under realistic conditions. Therefore, not only is it unclear which test to use, but also how much trust we should put in them. In contrast to past studies, in this paper we employ a recent simulation methodology from TREC data to go around these limitations. Our study comprises over 500 million p-values computed for a range of tests, systems, effectiveness measures, topic set sizes and effect sizes, and for both the 2-tail and 1-tail cases. Having such a large supply of IR evaluation data with full knowledge of the null hypotheses, we are finally in a position to evaluate how well statistical significance tests really behave with IR data, and make sound recommendations for practitioners."

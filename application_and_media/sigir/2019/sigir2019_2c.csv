Knowledge Tracing with Sequential Key-Value Memory Networks,"Can machines trace human knowledge like humans? Knowledge tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in a wide range of applications in education, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), intelligent tutoring systems, educational games, and learning management systems. It models dynamics in a student's knowledge states in relation to different learning concepts through their interactions with learning activities. Recently, several attempts have been made to use deep learning models for tackling the KT problem. Although these deep learning models have shown promising results, they have limitations: either lack the ability to go deeper to trace how specific concepts in a knowledge state are mastered by a student, or fail to capture long-term dependencies in an exercise sequence. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a novel deep learning model for knowledge tracing, namely Sequential Key-Value Memory Networks (SKVMN). This model unifies the strengths of recurrent modelling capacity and memory capacity of the existing deep learning KT models for modelling student learning. We have extensively evaluated our proposed model on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that (1) SKVMN outperforms the state-of-the-art KT models on all datasets, (2) SKVMN can better discover the correlation between latent concepts and questions, and (3) SKVMN can trace the knowledge state of students dynamics, and a leverage sequential dependencies in an exercise sequence for improved predication accuracy."
Personal Knowledge Base Construction from Text-based Lifelogs,"Previous work on lifelogging focuses on life event extraction from image, audio, and video data via wearable sensors. In contrast to wearing an extra camera to record daily life, people are used to log their life on social media platforms. In this paper, we aim to extract life events from textual data shared on Twitter and construct personal knowledge bases of individuals. The issues to be tackled include (1) not all text descriptions are related to life events, (2) life events in a text description can be expressed explicitly or implicitly, (3) the predicates in the implicit events are often absent, and (4) the mapping from natural language predicates to knowledge base relations may be ambiguous. A joint learning approach is proposed to detect life events in tweets and extract event components including subjects, predicates, objects, and time expressions. Finally, the extracted information is transformed to knowledge base facts. The evaluation is performed on a collection of lifelogs from 18 Twitter users. Experimental results show our proposed system is effective in life event extraction, and the constructed personal knowledge bases are expected to be useful to memory recall applications."
Identifying Entity Properties from Text with Zero-shot Learning,"We propose a method for identifying a set of entity properties from text. Identifying entity properties is similar to a relation extraction task that can be cast as a classification of sentences. Normally, this task can be achieved by distant supervised learning by automatically preparing training sentences for each property; however, it is impractical to prepare training sentences for every property. Therefore, we describe a zero-shot learning problem for this task and propose a neural network-based model that does not rely on a complete training set comprising training sentences for every property. To achieve this, we utilize embeddings of properties obtained from a knowledge graph embedding using different components of a knowledge graph structure. The embeddings of properties are combined with the model to enable identification of properties with no available training sentences. By using our newly constructed dataset as well as an existing dataset, experiments revealed that our model achieved a better performance for properties with no training sentences, relative to baseline results, even comparable to that achieved for properties with training sentences."
One-Class Order Embedding for Dependency Relation Prediction,"Learning the dependency relations among entities and the hierarchy formed by these relations by mapping entities into some order embedding space can effectively enable several important applications, including knowledge base completion and prerequisite relations prediction. Nevertheless, it is very challenging to learn a good order embedding due to the existence of partial ordering and missing relations in the observed data. Moreover, most application scenarios do not provide non-trivial negative dependency relation instances. We therefore propose a framework that performs dependency relation prediction by exploring both rich semantic and hierarchical structure information in the data. In particular, we propose several negative sampling strategies based on graph-specific centrality properties, which supplement the positive dependency relations with appropriate negative samples to effectively learn order embeddings. This research not only addresses the needs of automatically recovering missing dependency relations, but also unravels dependencies among entities using several real-world datasets, such as course dependency hierarchy involving course prerequisite relations, job hierarchy in organizations, and paper citation hierarchy. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the prediction accuracy as well as to gain insights using the learned order embedding."
ENT Rank: Retrieving Entities for Topical Information Needs through Entity-Neighbor-Text Relations,Related work has demonstrated the helpfulness of utilizing information about entities in text retrieval; here we explore the converse: Utilizing information about text in entity retrieval. We model the relevance of Entity-Neighbor-Text (ENT) relations to derive a learning-to-rank-entities model.

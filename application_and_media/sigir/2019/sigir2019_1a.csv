A General Framework for Counterfactual Learning-to-Rank,"Implicit feedback (e.g., click, dwell time) is an attractive source of training data for Learning-to-Rank, but its naive use leads to learning results that are distorted by presentation bias. For the special case of optimizing average rank for linear ranking functions, however, the recently developed SVM-PropRank method has shown that counterfactual inference techniques can be used to provably overcome the distorting effect of presentation bias. Going beyond this special case, this paper provides a general and theoretically rigorous framework for counterfactual learning-to-rank that enables unbiased training for a broad class of additive ranking metrics (e.g., Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)) as well as a broad class of models (e.g., deep networks). Specifically, we derive a relaxation for propensity-weighted rank-based metrics which is subdifferentiable and thus suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this general approach by instantiating two new learning methods. One is a new type of unbiased SVM that optimizes DCG - called SVM PropDCG - and we show how the resulting optimization problem can be solved via the Convex Concave Procedure (CCP). The other is Deep PropDCG, where the ranking function can be an arbitrary deep network. In addition to the theoretical support, we empirically find that SVM PropDCG significantly outperforms existing linear rankers in terms of DCG. Moreover, the ability to train non-linear ranking functions via Deep PropDCG further improves performance."
To Model or to Intervene: A Comparison of Counterfactual and Online Learning to Rank from User Interactions,"Learning to Rank (LTR) from user interactions is challenging as user feedback often contains high levels of bias and noise. At the moment, two methodologies for dealing with bias prevail in the field of LTR: counterfactual methods that learn from historical data and model user behavior to deal with biases; and online methods that perform interventions to deal with bias but use no explicit user models. For practitioners the decision between either methodology is very important because of its direct impact on end users. Nevertheless, there has never been a direct comparison between these two approaches to unbiased LTR. In this study we provide the first benchmarking of both counterfactual and online LTR methods under different experimental conditions. Our results show that the choice between the methodologies is consequential and depends on the presence of selection bias, and the degree of position bias and interaction noise. In settings with little bias or noise counterfactual methods can obtain the highest ranking performance; however, in other circumstances their optimization can be detrimental to the user experience. Conversely, online methods are very robust to bias and noise but require control over the displayed rankings. Our findings confirm and contradict existing expectations on the impact of model-based and intervention-based methods in LTR, and allow practitioners to make an informed decision between the two methodologies."
Domain Adaptation for Enterprise Email Search,"In the enterprise email search setting, the same search engine often powers multiple enterprises from various industries: technology, education, manufacturing, etc. However, using the same global ranking model across different enterprises may result in suboptimal search quality, due to the corpora differences and distinct information needs. On the other hand, training an individual ranking model for each enterprise may be infeasible, especially for smaller institutions with limited data. To address this data challenge, in this paper we propose a domain adaptation approach that fine-tunes the global model to each individual enterprise. In particular, we propose a novel application of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) approach to information retrieval, which attempts to bridge the gap between the global data distribution and the data distribution for a given individual enterprise. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on a large-scale email search engine, and demonstrate that the MMD approach consistently improves the search quality for multiple individual domains, both in comparison to the global ranking model, as well as several competitive domain adaptation baselines including adversarial learning methods."

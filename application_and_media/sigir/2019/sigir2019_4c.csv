Task Completion Detection: A Study in the Context of Intelligent Systems,"People can record their pending tasks using to-do lists, digital assistants, and other task management software. In doing so, users of these systems face at least two challenges: (1) they must manually mark their tasks as complete, and (2) when systems proactively remind them about their pending tasks, say, via interruptive notifications, they lack information on task completion status. As a result, people may not realize the full benefits of to-do lists (since these lists can contain both completed and pending tasks) and they may be reminded about tasks they have already done (wasting time and causing frustration). In this paper, we present methods to automatically detect task completion. These inferences can be used to deprecate completed tasks and/or suppress notifications for these tasks (or for other purposes, e.g., task prioritization). Using log data from a popular digital assistant, we analyze temporal dynamics in the completion of tasks and train machine-learned models to detect completion with accuracy exceeding 80% using a variety of features (time elapsed since task creation, task content, email, notifications, user history). The findings have implications for the design of intelligent systems to help people manage their tasks."
Bridging Gaps: Predicting User and Task Characteristics from Partial User Information,"Interactive information retrieval (IIR) researchers often conduct laboratory studies to understand the relationship between people seeking information and information retrieval systems. They develop extensive data collection methods and tools create new understanding about the relationship between observable behaviors, searcher context, and underlying cognition, to better support people's information seeking. Yet aside from the problems of data size, realism, and demographics, laboratory studies are limited in the number and nature of phenomena they can study. Hence, data collected in laboratories contains different searcher populations and collects non-overlapping user and task characteristics. While research analyses and collection methods are isolated, how can we further IIR's mission of broad understanding? We approach this as a structure learning problem on incomplete data, determining the extent to which incomplete data can be used to predict user and task characteristics from interactions. In particular, we examine whether combining heterogeneous data sets is more effective than using a single data set alone in prediction. Our results indicate that adding external data significantly improves predictions of searcher characteristics, task characteristics, and behaviors, even when the data does not contain identical information about searchers."
Human Behavior Inspired Machine Reading Comprehension,"Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is one of the most challenging tasks in both NLP and IR researches. Recently, a number of deep neural models have been successfully adopted to some simplified MRC task settings, whose performances were close to or even better than human beings. However, these models still have large performance gaps with human beings in more practical settings, such as MS MARCO and DuReader datasets. Although there are many works studying human reading behavior, the behavior patterns in complex reading comprehension scenarios remain under-investigated. We believe that a better understanding of how human reads and allocates their attention during reading comprehension processes can help improve the performance of MRC tasks. In this paper, we conduct a lab study to investigate human's reading behavior patterns during reading comprehension tasks, where 32 users are recruited to take 60 distinct tasks. By analyzing the collected eye-tracking data and answers from participants, we propose a two-stage reading behavior model, in which the first stage is to search for possible answer candidates and the second stage is to generate the final answer through a comparison and verification process. We also find that human's attention distribution is affected by both question-dependent factors (e.g., answer and soft matching signal with questions) and question-independent factors (e.g., position, IDF and Part-of-Speech tags of words). We extract features derived from the two-stage reading behavior model to predict human's attention signals during reading comprehension, which significantly improves performance in the MRC task. Findings in our work may bring insight into the understanding of human reading and information seeking processes, and help the machine to better meet users' information needs."

A Collaborative Session-based Recommendation Approach with Parallel Memory Modules,"Session-based recommendation is the task of predicting the next item to recommend when the only available information consists of anonymous behavior sequences. Previous methods for session-based recommendation focus mostly on the current session, ignoring collaborative information in so-called neighborhood sessions, sessions that have been generated previously by other users and reflect similar user intents as the current session. We hypothesize that the collaborative information contained in such neighborhood sessions may help to improve recommendation performance for the current session."
Similarity-Based Synthetic Document Representations for Meta-Feature Generation in Text Classification,"We propose new solutions that enhance and extend the already very successful application of meta-features to text classification. Our newly proposed meta-features are capable of: (1) improving the correlation of small pieces of evidence shared by neighbors with labeled categories by means of synthetic document representations and (local and global) hyperplane distances; and (2) estimating the level of error introduced by these newly proposed and the existing meta-features in the literature, specially for hard-to-classify regions of the feature space. Our experiments with large and representative number of datasets show that our new solutions produce the best results in all tested scenarios, achieving gains of up to 12% over the strongest meta-feature proposal of the literature."
Finding Camouflaged Needle in a Haystack?: Pornographic Products Detection via Berrypicking Tree Model,"It is an important and urgent research problem for decentralized eCommerce services, e.g., eBay, eBid, and Taobao, to detect illegal products, e.g., unclassified pornographic products. However, it is a challenging task as some sellers may utilize and change camouflaged text to deceive the current detection algorithms. In this study, we propose a novel task to dynamically locate the pornographic products from very large product collections. Unlike prior product classification efforts focusing on textual information, the proposed model, BerryPIcking TRee MoDel (BIRD), utilizes both product textual content and buyers' seeking behavior information as berrypicking trees. In particular, the BIRD encodes both semantic information with respect to all branches sequence and the overall latent buyer intent during the whole seeking process. An extensive set of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model against alternative solutions. To facilitate further research of this practical and important problem, the codes and buyers' seeking behavior data have been made publicly available1."

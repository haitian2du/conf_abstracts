Quantifying and Alleviating the Language Prior Problem in Visual Question Answering,"Benefiting from the advancement of computer vision, natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, visual question answering (VQA), which aims to answer questions about an image or a video, has received lots of attentions over the past few years. Although some progress has been achieved so far, several studies have pointed out that current VQA models are heavily affected by the language prior problem, which means they tend to answer questions based on the co-occurrence patterns of question keywords (e.g., how many) and answers (e.g., 2) instead of understanding images and questions. Existing methods attempt to solve this problem by either balancing the biased datasets or forcing models to better understand images. However, only marginal effects and even performance deterioration are observed for the first and second solution, respectively. In addition, another important issue is the lack of measurement to quantitatively measure the extent of the language prior effect, which severely hinders the advancement of related techniques."
Document Gated Reader for Open-Domain Question Answering,"Open-domain question answering focuses on using diverse information resources to answer any types of question. Recent years, with the development of large-scale data set and various deep neural networks models, some recent advances in open domain question answering system first utilize the distantly supervised dataset as the knowledge resource, then apply deep learning based machine comprehension techniques to generate the right answers, which achieves impressive results compared with traditional feature-based pipeline methods."
Adaptive Multi-Attention Network Incorporating Answer Information for Duplicate Question Detection,"Community-based question answering (CQA), which provides a platform for people with diverse backgrounds to share information and knowledge, has become increasingly popular. With the accumulation of site data, methods to detect duplicate questions in CQA sites have attracted considerable attention. Existing methods typically use only questions to complete the task. However, the paired answers may also provide valuable information. In this paper, we propose an answer information- enhanced adaptive multi-attention network (AMAN) to perform this task. AMAN takes full advantage of the semantic information in the paired answers while alleviating the noise problem caused by adding the answers. To evaluate the proposed method, we use a CQADupStack set and the Quora question-pair dataset expanded with paired answers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the above two data sets."
Answering Complex Questions by Joining Multi-Document Evidence with Quasi Knowledge Graphs,"Direct answering of questions that involve multiple entities and relations is a challenge for text-based QA. This problem is most pronounced when answers can be found only by joining evidence from multiple documents. Curated knowledge graphs (KGs) may yield good answers, but are limited by their inherent incompleteness and potential staleness. This paper presents QUEST, a method that can answer complex questions directly from textual sources on-the-fly, by computing similarity joins over partial results from different documents. Our method is completely unsupervised, avoiding training-data bottlenecks and being able to cope with rapidly evolving ad hoc topics and formulation style in user questions. QUEST builds a noisy quasi KG with node and edge weights, consisting of dynamically retrieved entity names and relational phrases. It augments this graph with types and semantic alignments, and computes the best answers by an algorithm for Group Steiner Trees. We evaluate QUEST on benchmarks of complex questions, and show that it substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."
Controlling Risk of Web Question Answering,"Web question answering (QA) has become an dispensable component in modern search systems, which can significantly improve users' search experience by providing a direct answer to users' information need. This could be achieved by applying machine reading comprehension (MRC) models over the retrieved passages to extract answers with respect to the search query. With the development of deep learning techniques, state-of-the-art MRC performances have been achieved by recent deep methods. However, existing studies on MRC seldom address the predictive uncertainty issue, i.e., how likely the prediction of an MRC model is wrong, leading to uncontrollable risks in real-world Web QA applications. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth investigation over the risk of Web QA. We then introduce a novel risk control framework, which consists of a qualify model for uncertainty estimation using the probe idea, and a decision model for selectively output. For evaluation, we introduce risk-related metrics, rather than the traditional EM and F1 in MRC, for the evaluation of risk-aware Web QA. The empirical results over both the real-world Web QA dataset and the academic MRC benchmark collection demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Why do Users Issue Good Queries?: Neural Correlates of Term Specificity,"Despite advances in the past few decades in studying what kind of queries users input to search engines and how to suggest queries for the users, the fundamental question of what makes human cognition able to estimate goodness of query terms is largely unanswered. For example, a person searching information about ""cats'' is able to choose query terms, such as ""housecat'', ""feline'', or ""animal'' and avoid terms like ""similar'', ""variety'', and ""distinguish''. We investigated the association between the specificity of terms occurring in documents and human brain activity measured via electroencephalography (EEG). We analyzed the brain activity data of fifteen participants, recorded in response to reading terms from Wikipedia documents. Term specificity was shown to be associated with the amplitude of evoked brain responses. The results indicate that by being able to determine which terms carry maximal information about, and can best discriminate between, documents, people have the capability to enter good query terms. Moreover, our results suggest that the effective query term selection process, often observed in practical search behavior studies, has a neural basis. We believe our findings constitute an important step in revealing the cognitive processing behind query formulation and evaluating informativeness of language in general."
Context Attentive Document Ranking and Query Suggestion,"We present a context-aware neural ranking model to exploit users' on-task search activities and enhance retrieval performance. In particular, a two-level hierarchical recurrent neural network is introduced to learn search context representation of individual queries, search tasks, and corresponding dependency structure by jointly optimizing two companion retrieval tasks: document ranking and query suggestion. To identify variable dependency structure between search context and users' ongoing search activities, attention at both levels of recurrent states are introduced. Extensive experiment comparisons against a rich set of baseline methods and an in-depth ablation analysis confirm the value of our proposed approach for modeling search context buried in search tasks."
"Information Needs, Queries, and Query Performance Prediction","The query performance prediction (QPP) task is to estimate the effectiveness of a search performed in response to a query with no relevance judgments. Existing QPP methods do not account for the effectiveness of a query in representing the underlying information need. We demonstrate the far-reaching implications of this reality using standard TREC-based evaluation of QPP methods: their relative prediction quality patterns vary with respect to the effectiveness of queries used to represent the information needs. Motivated by our findings, we revise the basic probabilistic formulation of the QPP task by accounting for the information need and its connection to the query. We further explore this connection by proposing a novel QPP approach that utilizes information about a set of queries representing the same information need. Predictors instantiated from our approach using a wide variety of existing QPP methods post prediction quality that substantially transcends that of applying these methods, as is standard, using a single query representing the information need. Additional in-depth empirical analysis of different aspects of our approach further attests to the crucial role of query effectiveness in QPP."

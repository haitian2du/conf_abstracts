PSGAN: A Minimax Game for Personalized Search with Limited and Noisy Click Data,"Personalized search aims to adapt document ranking to user's personal interests. Traditionally, this is done by extracting click and topical features from historical data in order to construct a user profile. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully used in personalized search due to its ability of automatic feature learning. However, the small amount of noisy personal data poses challenges to deep learning models to learn the personalized classification boundary between relevant and irrelevant results. In this paper, we propose PSGAN, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for personalized search. By means of adversarial training, we enforce the model to pay more attention to training data that are difficult to distinguish. We use the discriminator to evaluate personalized relevance of documents and use the generator to learn the distribution of relevant documents. Two alternative ways to construct the generator in the framework are tested: based on the current query or based on a set of generated queries. Experiments on data from a commercial search engine show that our models can yield significant improvements over state-of-the-art models."
Lifelong Sequential Modeling with Personalized Memorization for User Response Prediction,"User response prediction, which models the user preference w.r.t. the presented items, plays a key role in online services. With two-decade rapid development, nowadays the cumulated user behavior sequences on mature Internet service platforms have become extremely long since the user's first registration. Each user not only has intrinsic tastes, but also keeps changing her personal interests during lifetime. Hence, it is challenging to handle such lifelong sequential modeling for each individual user. Existing methodologies for sequential modeling are only capable of dealing with relatively recent user behaviors, which leaves huge space for modeling long-term especially lifelong sequential patterns to facilitate user modeling. Moreover, one user's behavior may be accounted for various previous behaviors within her whole online activity history, i.e., long-term dependency with multi-scale sequential patterns. In order to tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Periodic Memory Network for lifelong sequential modeling with personalized memorization of sequential patterns for each user. The model also adopts a hierarchical and periodical updating mechanism to capture multi-scale sequential patterns of user interests while supporting the evolving user behavior logs. The experimental results over three large-scale real-world datasets have demonstrated the advantages of our proposed model with significant improvement in user response prediction performance against the state-of-the-arts."
Multi-view Embedding-based Synonyms for Email Search,"Synonym expansion is a technique that adds related words to search queries, which may lead to more relevant documents being retrieved, thus improving recall. There is extensive prior work on synonym expansion for web search, however very few studies have tackled its application for email search. Synonym expansion for private corpora like emails poses several unique research challenges. First, the emails are not shared across users, which precludes us from directly employing query-document bipartite graphs, which are standard in web search synonym expansion. Second, user search queries are of personal nature, and may not be generalizable across users. Third, the size of the underlying corpora from which the synonyms may be mined is relatively small (i.e., user's private email inbox) compared to the size of the web corpus. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a solution tailored to the challenges of synonym expansion for email search. We formulate it as a multi-view learning problem, and propose a novel embedding-based model that joins information from multiple sources to obtain the optimal synonym candidates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we evaluate our model using both explicit human ratings as well as a live experiment using the Gmail Search service, one of the world's largest email search engines."
Context-Aware Intent Identification in Email Conversations,"Email continues to be one of the most important means of online communication. People spend a significant amount of time sending, reading, searching and responding to email in order to manage tasks, exchange information, etc. In this paper, we study intent identification in workplace email. We use a large scale publicly available email dataset to characterize intents in enterprise email and propose methods for improving intent identification in email conversations. Previous work focused on classifying email messages into broad topical categories or detecting sentences that contain action items or follow certain speech acts. In this work, we focus on sentence-level intent identification and study how incorporating more context (such as the full message body and other metadata) could improve the performance of the intent identification models. We experiment with several models for leveraging context including both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches. We show that modeling the interaction between sentence and context can significantly improve the performance."

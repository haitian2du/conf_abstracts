Relational Collaborative Filtering: Modeling Multiple Item Relations for Recommendation,"Existing item-based collaborative filtering (ICF) methods leverage only the relation of collaborative similarity - i.e., the item similarity evidenced by user interactions like ratings and purchases. Nevertheless, there exist multiple relations between items in real-world scenarios, e.g., two movies share the same director, two products complement with each other, etc. Distinct from the collaborative similarity that implies co-interact patterns from the user's perspective, these relations reveal fine-grained knowledge on items from different perspectives of meta-data, functionality, etc. However, how to incorporate multiple item relations is less explored in recommendation research."
Noise Contrastive Estimation for One-Class Collaborative Filtering,"Previous highly scalable One-Class Collaborative Filtering (OC-CF) methods such as Projected Linear Recommendation (PLRec) have advocated using fast randomized SVD to embed items into a latent space, followed by linear regression methods to learn personalized recommendation models per user. However, naive SVD embedding methods often exhibit a strong popularity bias that prevents them from accurately embedding less popular items, which is exacerbated by the extreme sparsity of implicit feedback matrices in the OC-CF setting. To address this deficiency, we leverage insights from Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to derive a closed-form, efficiently computable ""depopularized"" embedding. We show that NCE item embeddings combined with a personalized user model from PLRec produces superior recommendations that adequately account for popularity bias. Further analysis of the popularity distribution of recommended items demonstrates that NCE-PLRec uniformly distributes recommendations over the popularity spectrum while other methods exhibit distinct biases towards specific popularity subranges. Empirically, NCE-PLRec produces highly competitive performance with run-times an order of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art approaches for OC-CF."
Compositional Coding for Collaborative Filtering,"Efficiency is crucial to the online recommender systems, especially for the ones which needs to deal with tens of millions of users and items. Because representing users and items as binary vectors for Collaborative Filtering (CF) can achieve fast user-item affinity computation in the Hamming space, in recent years, we have witnessed an emerging research effort in exploiting binary hashing techniques for CF methods. However, CF with binary codes naturally suffers from low accuracy due to limited representation capability in each bit, which impedes it from modeling complex structure of the data."
Unified Collaborative Filtering over Graph Embeddings,"Collaborative Filtering (CF) by learning from the wisdom of crowds has become one of the most important approaches to recommender systems research, and various CF models have been designed and applied to different scenarios. However, a challenging task is how to select the most appropriate CF model for a specific recommendation task. In this paper, we propose a Unified Collaborative Filtering framework based on Graph Embeddings (UGrec for short) to solve the problem. Specifically, UGrec models user and item interactions within a graph network, and sequential recommendation path is designed as a basic unit to capture the correlations between users and items. Mathematically, we show that many representative recommendation approaches and their variants can be mapped as a recommendation path in the graph. In addition, by applying a carefully designed attention mechanism on the recommendation paths, UGrec can determine the significance of each sequential recommendation path so as to conduct automatic model selection. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method shows significant improvements for recommendation quality. This work also leads to a deeper understanding of the connection between graph embeddings and recommendation algorithms."
Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering,"Learning vector representations (aka. embeddings) of users and items lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user's (or an item's) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect."

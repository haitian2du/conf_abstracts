Session details: Session 8A: User Behavior and Experience,No abstract available.
Effects of User Negative Experience in Mobile News Streaming,"Online news streaming services have been one of the major information acquisition resources for mobile users. In many cases, users click an article but find it cannot satisfy or even annoy them. Intuitively, these negative experiences will affect users' behaviors and satisfaction, but such effects have not been well understood. In this work, a retrospective analysis is conducted using real users' log data, containing user's explicit feedback of negative experiences, from a commercial news streaming application. Through multiple intra-session comparison experiments, we find that in current session, users will spend less time reading the content, lose activeness and leave sooner after having negative experiences. Later return and significant changes of user behaviors in the next session are also observed, which demonstrates the existence of inter-session effects of negative experiences."

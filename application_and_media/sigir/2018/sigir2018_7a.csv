Item Retrieval as Utility Estimation,"Retrieval systems have greatly improved over the last half century, estimating relevance to a latent user need in a wide variety of areas. One common task in e-commerce and science that has not enjoyed such advancements is searching through a catalog of items. Finding a desirable item in such a catalog requires that the user specify desirable item properties, specifically desirable attribute values. Existing item retrieval systems assume the user can formulate a good Boolean or SQL-style query to retrieve items, as one would do with a database, but this is often challenging, particularly given multiple numeric attributes. Such systems avoid inferring query intent, instead requiring the user to precisely specify what matches the query. A contrasting approach would be to estimate how well items match the user's latent desires and return items ranked by this estimation. Towards this end, we present a retrieval model inspired by multi-criteria decision making theory, concentrating on numeric attributes. In two user studies (choosing airline tickets and meal plans) using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluate our novel approach against the de facto standard of Boolean retrieval and several models proposed in the literature. We use a novel competitive game to motivate test subjects and compare methods based on the results of the subjects' initial query and their success in the game. In our experiments, our new method significantly outperformed the others, whereas the Boolean approaches had the worst performance."
Crowd vs. Expert: What Can Relevance Judgment Rationales Teach Us About Assessor Disagreement?,"While crowdsourcing offers a low-cost, scalable way to collect relevance judgments, lack of transparency with remote crowd work has limited understanding about the quality of collected judgments. In prior work, we showed a variety of benefits from asking crowd workers to provide \em rationales for each relevance judgment \citemcdonnell2016relevant. In this work, we scale up our rationale-based judging design to assess its reliability on the 2014 TREC Web Track, collecting roughly 25K crowd judgments for 5K document-topic pairs. We also study having crowd judges perform topic-focused judging, rather than across topics, finding this improves quality. Overall, we show that crowd judgments can be used to reliably rank IR systems for evaluation. We further explore the potential of rationales to shed new light on reasons for judging disagreement between experts and crowd workers. Our qualitative and quantitative analysis distinguishes subjective vs.\ objective forms of disagreement, as well as the relative importance of each disagreement cause, and we present a new taxonomy for organizing the different types of disagreement we observe. We show that many crowd disagreements seem valid and plausible, with disagreement in many cases due to judging errors by the original TREC assessors. We also share our WebCrowd25k dataset, including: (1) crowd judgments with rationales, and (2) taxonomy category labels for each judging disagreement analyzed."

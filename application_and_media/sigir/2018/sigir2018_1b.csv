A Click Sequence Model for Web Search,"Getting a better understanding of user behavior is important for advancing information retrieval systems. Existing work focuses on modeling and predicting single interaction events, such as clicks. In this paper, we for the first time focus on modeling and predicting sequences of interaction events. And in particular, sequences of clicks. We formulate the problem of click sequence prediction and propose a click sequence model (CSM) that aims to predict the order in which a user will interact with search engine results. CSM is based on a neural network that follows the encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder computes contextual embeddings of the results. The decoder predicts the sequence of positions of the clicked results. It uses an attention mechanism to extract necessary information about the results at each timestep. We optimize the parameters of CSM by maximizing the likelihood of observed click sequences. We test the effectiveness of CSM on three new tasks: (i) predicting click sequences, (ii) predicting the number of clicks, and (iii) predicting whether or not a user will interact with the results in the order these results are presented on a search engine result page (SERP). Also, we show that CSM achieves state-of-the-art results on a standard click prediction task, where the goal is to predict an unordered set of results a user will click on."
Understanding and Evaluating User Satisfaction with Music Discovery,"We study the use and evaluation of a system for supporting music discovery, the experience of finding and listening to content previously unknown to the user. We adopt a mixed methods approach, including interviews, unsupervised learning, survey research, and statistical modeling, to understand and evaluate user satisfaction in the context of discovery. User interviews and survey data show that users' behaviors change according to their goals, such as listening to recommended tracks in the moment, or using recommendations as a starting point for exploration. We use these findings to develop a statistical model of user satisfaction at scale from interactions with a music streaming platform. We show that capturing users' goals, their deviations from their usual behavior, and their peak interactions on individual tracks are informative for estimating user satisfaction. Finally, we present and validate heuristic metrics that are grounded in user experience for online evaluation of recommendation performance. Our findings, supported with evidence from both qualitative and quantitative studies, reveal new insights about user expectations with discovery and their behavioral responses to satisfying and dissatisfying systems."
Identifying Users behind Shared Accounts in Online Streaming Services,"Online streaming services are prevalent. Major service providers, such as Netflix (for movies) and Spotify (for music), usually have a large customer base. More often than not, users may share an account. This has attracted increasing attention recently, as account sharing not only compromises the service provider's financial interests but also impairs the performance of recommendation systems and consequently the quality of service provided to the users. To address this issue, this paper focuses on the problem of user identification in shared accounts. Our goal is three-fold: (1) Given an account, along with its historical session logs, we identify a set of users who share such account; (2) Given a new session issued by an account, we find the corresponding user among the identified users of such account; (3) We aim to boost the performance of item recommendation by user identification. While the mapping between users and accounts is unknown, we propose an unsupervised learning-based framework, Session-based Heterogeneous graph Embedding for User Identification (SHE-UI), to differentiate and model the preferences of users in an account, and to group sessions by these users. In SHE-UI, a heterogeneous graph is constructed to represent items such as songs and their available metadata such as artists, genres, and albums. An item-based session embedding technique is proposed using a normalized random walk in the heterogeneous graph. Our experiments conducted on two large-scale music streaming datasets, Last.fm and KKBOX, show that SHE-UI not only accurately identifies users, but also significantly improves the performance of item recommendation over the state-of-the-art methods."
Predicting User Knowledge Gain in Informational Search Sessions,"Web search is frequently used by people to acquire new knowledge and to satisfy learning-related objectives. In this context, informational search missions with an intention to obtain knowledge pertaining to a topic are prominent. The importance of learning as an outcome of web search has been recognized. Yet, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of web search on a user's knowledge state. Predicting the knowledge gain of users can be an important step forward if web search engines that are currently optimized for relevance can be molded to serve learning outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a supervised model to predict a user's knowledge state and knowledge gain from features captured during the search sessions. To measure and predict the knowledge gain of users in informational search sessions, we recruited 468 distinct users using crowdsourcing and orchestrated real-world search sessions spanning 11 different topics and information needs. By using scientifically formulated knowledge tests, we calibrated the knowledge of users before and after their search sessions, quantifying their knowledge gain. Our supervised models utilise and derive a comprehensive set of features from the current state of the art and compare performance of a range of feature sets and feature selection strategies. Through our results, we demonstrate the ability to predict and classify the knowledge state and gain using features obtained during search sessions, exhibiting superior performance to an existing baseline in the knowledge state prediction task."

Neural Compatibility Modeling with Attentive Knowledge Distillation,"Recently, the booming fashion sector and its huge potential benefits have attracted tremendous attention from many research communities. In particular, increasing research efforts have been dedicated to the complementary clothing matching as matching clothes to make a suitable outfit has become a daily headache for many people, especially those who do not have the sense of aesthetics. Thanks to the remarkable success of neural networks in various applications such as the image classification and speech recognition, the researchers are enabled to adopt the data-driven learning methods to analyze fashion items. Nevertheless, existing studies overlook the rich valuable knowledge (rules) accumulated in fashion domain, especially the rules regarding clothing matching. Towards this end, in this work, we shed light on the complementary clothing matching by integrating the advanced deep neural networks and the rich fashion domain knowledge. Considering that the rules can be fuzzy and different rules may have different confidence levels to different samples, we present a neural compatibility modeling scheme with attentive knowledge distillation based on the teacher-student network scheme. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset show the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art methods. Based upon the comparisons, we observe certain fashion insights that can add value to the fashion matching study. As a byproduct, we released the codes, and involved parameters to benefit other researchers."
Attentive Moment Retrieval in Videos,"In the past few years, language-based video retrieval has attracted a lot of attention. However, as a natural extension, localizing the specific video moments within a video given a description query is seldom explored. Although these two tasks look similar, the latter is more challenging due to two main reasons: 1) The former task only needs to judge whether the query occurs in a video and returns an entire video, but the latter is expected to judge which moment within a video matches the query and accurately returns the start and end points of the moment. Due to the fact that different moments in a video have varying durations and diverse spatial-temporal characteristics, uncovering the underlying moments is highly challenging. 2) As for the key component of relevance estimation, the former usually embeds a video and the query into a common space to compute the relevance score. However, the later task concerns moment localization where not only the features of a specific moment matter, but the context information of the moment also contributes a lot. For example, the query may contain temporal constraint words, such as ""first'', therefore need temporal context to properly comprehend them. To address these issues, we develop an Attentive Cross-Modal Retrieval Network. In particular, we design a memory attention mechanism to emphasize the visual features mentioned in the query and simultaneously incorporate their context. In the light of this, we obtain the augmented moment representation. Meanwhile, a cross-modal fusion sub-network learns both the intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics, which can enhance the learning of moment-query representation. We evaluate our method on two datasets: DiDeMo and TACoS. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our model as compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Enhancing Person-Job Fit for Talent Recruitment: An Ability-aware Neural Network Approach,"The wide spread use of online recruitment services has led to information explosion in the job market. As a result, the recruiters have to seek the intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right job seekers to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit have a focus on measuring the matching degree between the talent qualification and the job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts despite of the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of the human judgement. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end A bility-aware P erson-J ob F it N eural N etwork (APJFNN) model, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labour and can provide better interpretation about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available at abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers' experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, four hierarchical ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measuring the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world data set clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the APJFNN framework compared with several baselines."
Cross-Modal Retrieval in the Cooking Context: Learning Semantic Text-Image Embeddings,"Designing powerful tools that support cooking activities has rapidly gained popularity due to the massive amounts of available data, as well as recent advances in machine learning that are capable of analyzing them. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal retrieval model aligning visual and textual data (like pictures of dishes and their recipes) in a shared representation space. We describe an effective learning scheme, capable of tackling large-scale problems, and validate it on the Recipe1M dataset containing nearly 1 million picture-recipe pairs. We show the effectiveness of our approach regarding previous state-of-the-art models and present qualitative results over computational cooking use cases."

Ranking for Relevance and Display Preferences in Complex Presentation Layouts,"Learning to Rank has traditionally considered settings where given the relevance information of objects, the desired order in which to rank the objects is clear. However, with today's large variety of users and layouts this is not always the case. In this paper, we consider so-called complex ranking settings where it is not clear what should be displayed, that is, what the relevant items are, and how they should be displayed, that is, where the most relevant items should be placed. These ranking settings are complex as they involve both traditional ranking and inferring the best display order. Existing learning to rank methods cannot handle such complex ranking settings as they assume that the display order is known beforehand. To address this gap we introduce a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning method that is capable of learning complex rankings, both the layout and the best ranking given the layout, from weak reward signals. Our proposed method does so by selecting documents and positions sequentially, hence it ranks both the documents and positions, which is why we call it the Double Rank Model (DRM). Our experiments show that DRM outperforms all existing methods in complex ranking settings, thus it leads to substantial ranking improvements in cases where the display order is not known a priori."
Natural Language Interfaces with Fine-Grained User Interaction: A Case Study on Web APIs,"The rapidly increasing ubiquity of computing puts a great demand on next-generation human-machine interfaces. Natural language interfaces, exemplified by virtual assistants like Apple Siri and Microsoft Cortana, are widely believed to be a promising direction. However, current natural language interfaces provide users with little help in case of incorrect interpretation of user commands. We hypothesize that the support of fine-grained user interaction can greatly improve the usability of natural language interfaces. In the specific setting of natural language interface to web APIs, we conduct a systematic study to verify our hypothesis. To facilitate this study, we propose a novel modular sequence-to-sequence model to create interactive natural language interfaces. By decomposing the complex prediction process of a typical sequence-to-sequence model into small, highly-specialized prediction units called modules, it becomes straightforward to explain the model prediction to the user, and solicit user feedback to correct possible prediction errors at a fine-grained level. We test our hypothesis by comparing an interactive natural language interface with its non-interactive version through both simulation and human subject experiments with real-world APIs. We show that with the interactive natural language interface, users can achieve a higher success rate and a lower task completion time, which lead to greatly improved user satisfaction."

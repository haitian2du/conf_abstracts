Seed-driven Document Ranking for Systematic Reviews in Evidence-Based Medicine,"Systematic review (SR) in evidence-based medicine is a literature review which provides a conclusion to a specific clinical question. To assure credible and reproducible conclusions, SRs are conducted by well-defined steps. One of the key steps, the screening step, is to identify relevant documents from a pool of candidate documents. Typically about 2000 candidate documents will be retrieved from databases using keyword queries for a SR. From which, about 20 relevant documents are manually identified by SR experts, based on detailed relevance conditions or eligibility criteria. Recent studies show that document ranking, or screening prioritization, is a promising way to improve the manual screening process. In this paper, we propose a seed-driven document ranking (SDR) model for effective screening, with the assumption that one relevant document is known, i.e., the seed document. Based on a detailed analysis of characteristics of relevant documents, SDR represents documents using bag of clinical terms, rather than the commonly used bag of words. More importantly, we propose a method to estimate the importance of the clinical terms based on their distribution in candidate documents. On benchmark dataset released by CLEF'17 eHealth Task 2, we show that the proposed SDR outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. Interestingly, we also observe that ranking based on word embedding representation of documents well complements SDR. The best ranking is achieved by combining the relevances estimated by SDR and by word embedding. Additionally, we report results of simulating the manual screening process with SDR."
A Dataset and an Examination of Identifying Passages for Due Diligence,"We present and formalize the due diligence problem, where lawyers extract data from legal documents to assess risk in a potential merger or acquisition, as an information retrieval task. Furthermore, we describe the creation and annotation of a document collection for the due diligence problem that will foster research in this area. This dataset comprises 50 topics over 4,412 documents and ~15 million sentences and is a subset of our own internal training data. Using this dataset, we present what we have found to be the state of the art for information extraction in the due diligence problem. In particular, we find that when treating documents as sequences of labelled and unlabelled sentences, Conditional Random Fields significantly and substantially outperform other techniques for sequence-based (Hidden Markov Models) and non-sequence based machine learning (logistic regression). Included in this is an analysis of what we perceive to be the major failure cases when extraction is performed based upon sentence labels."
Generating Better Queries for Systematic Reviews,"Systematic reviews form the cornerstone of evidence based medicine, aiming to answer complex medical questions based on all evidence currently available. Key to the effectiveness of a systematic review is an (often large) Boolean query used to search large publication repositories. These Boolean queries are carefully crafted by researchers and information specialists, and often reviewed by a panel of experts. However, little is known about the effectiveness of the Boolean queries at the time of formulation. In this paper we investigate whether a better Boolean query than that defined in the protocol of a systematic review, can be created, and we develop methods for the transformation of a given Boolean query into a more effective one. Our approach involves defining possible transformations of Boolean queries and their clauses. It also involves casting the problem of identifying a transformed query that is better than the original into: (i) a classification problem; and (ii) a learning to rank problem. Empirical experiments are conducted on a real set of systematic reviews. Analysis of results shows that query transformations that are better than the original queries do exist, and that our approaches are able to select more effective queries from the set of possible transformed queries so as to maximise different target effectiveness measures."
Modeling Dynamic Pairwise Attention for Crime Classification over Legal Articles,"In juridical field, judges usually need to consult several relevant cases to determine the specific articles that the evidence violated, which is a task that is time consuming and needs extensive professional knowledge. In this paper, we focus on how to save the manual efforts and make the conviction process more efficient. Specifically, we treat the evidences as documents, and articles as labels, thus the conviction process can be cast as a multi-label classification problem. However, the challenge in this specific scenario lies in two aspects. One is that the number of articles that evidences violated is dynamic, which we denote as the label dynamic problem. The other is that most articles are violated by only a few of the evidences, which we denote as the label imbalance problem. Previous methods usually learn the multi-label classification model and the label thresholds independently, and may ignore the label imbalance problem. To tackle with both challenges, we propose a unified D ynamic P airwise A ttention M odel (DPAM for short) in this paper. Specifically, DPAM adopts the multi-task learning paradigm to learn the multi-label classifier and the threshold predictor jointly, and thus DPAM can improve the generalization performance by leveraging the information learned in both of the two tasks. In addition, a pairwise attention model based on article definitions is incorporated into the classification model to help alleviate the label imbalance problem. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods."

Torch: A Search Engine for Trajectory Data,"This paper presents a new trajectory search engine called Torch for querying road network trajectory data. Torch is able to efficiently process two types of typical queries (similarity search and Boolean search), and support a wide variety of trajectory similarity functions. Additionally, we propose a new similarity function LORS in Torch to measure the similarity in a more effective and efficient manner. Indexing and search in Torch works as follows. First, each raw vehicle trajectory is transformed to a set of road segments (edges) and a set of crossings (vertices) on the road network. Then a lightweight edge and vertex index called LEVI is built. Given a query, a filtering framework over LEVI is used to dynamically prune the trajectory search space based on the similarity measure imposed. Finally, the result set (ranked or Boolean) is returned. Extensive experiments on real trajectory datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Torch."
Top-k Route Search through Submodularity Modeling of Recurrent POI Features,"We consider a practical top-k route search problem: given a collection of points of interest (POIs) with rated features and traveling costs between POIs, a user wants to find k routes from a source to a destination and limited in a cost budget, that maximally match her needs on feature preferences. One challenge is dealing with the personalized diversity requirement where users have various trade-off between quantity (the number of POIs with a specified feature) and variety (the coverage of specified features). Another challenge is the large scale of the POI map and the great many alternative routes to search. We model the personalized diversity requirement by the whole class of submodular functions, and present an optimal solution to the top-k route search problem through indices for retrieving relevant POIs in both feature and route spaces and various strategies for pruning the search space using user preferences and constraints. We also present promising heuristic solutions and evaluate all the solutions on real life data."
A Contextual Attention Recurrent Architecture for Context-Aware Venue Recommendation,"Venue recommendation systems aim to effectively rank a list of interesting venues users should visit based on their historical feedback (e.g. checkins). Such systems are increasingly deployed by Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare and Yelp to enhance their usefulness to users. Recently, various RNN architectures have been proposed to incorporate contextual information associated with the users' sequence of checkins (e.g. time of the day, location of venues) to effectively capture the users' dynamic preferences. However, these architectures assume that different types of contexts have an identical impact on the users' preferences, which may not hold in practice. For example, an ordinary context such as the time of the day reflects the user's current contextual preferences, whereas a transition context - such as a time interval from their last visited venue - indicates a transition effect from past behaviour to future behaviour. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Contextual Attention Recurrent Architecture (CARA) that leverages both sequences of feedback and contextual information associated with the sequences to capture the users' dynamic preferences. Our proposed recurrent architecture consists of two types of gating mechanisms, namely 1) a contextual attention gate that controls the influence of the ordinary context on the users' contextual preferences and 2) a time- and geo-based gate that controls the influence of the hidden state from the previous checkin based on the transition context. Thorough experiments on three large checkin and rating datasets from commercial LBSNs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CARA architecture by significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art RNN architectures and factorisation approaches."

Attentive Recurrent Social Recommendation,"Collaborative filtering(CF) is one of the most popular techniques for building recommender systems. To alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF, social recommendation has emerged by leveraging social influence among users for better recommendation performance. In these systems, users' preferences over time are determined by their temporal dynamic interests as well as the general static interests. In the meantime, the complex interplay between users' internal interests and the social influence from the social network drives the evolution of users' preferences over time. Nevertheless, traditional approaches either neglected the social network structure for temporal recommendation or assumed a static social influence strength for static social recommendation. Thus, the problem of how to leverage social influence to enhance temporal social recommendation performance remains pretty much open. To this end, in this paper, we present an attentive recurrent network based approach for temporal social recommendation. In the proposed approach, we model users' complex dynamic and general static preferences over time by fusing social influence among users with two attention networks. Specifically, in the dynamic preference modeling process, we design a dynamic social aware recurrent neural network to capture users' complex latent interests over time, where a temporal attention network is proposed to learn the temporal social influence over time. In the general static preference modeling process, we characterize each user's static interest by introducing a static social attention network to model the stationary social influence among users. The output of the dynamic preferences and the static preferences are combined together in a unified end-to-end framework for the temporal social recommendation task. Finally, experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the superiority of our proposed model compared to the baselines."
Mention Recommendation for Multimodal Microblog with Cross-attention Memory Network,"The users of Twitter-like social media normally use the ""@'' sign to select a suitable person to mention. It is a significant role in promoting the user experience and information propagation. To help users easily find the usernames they want to mention, the mention recommendation task has received considerable attention in recent years. Previous methods only incorporated textual information when performing this task. However, many users not only post texts on social media but also the corresponding images. These images can provide additional information that is not included in the text, which could be helpful in improving the accuracy of a mention recommendation. To make full use of textual and visual information, we propose a novel cross-attention memory network to perform the mention recommendation task for multimodal tweets. We incorporate the interests of users with external memory and use the cross-attention mechanism to extract both textual and visual information. Experimental results on a dataset collected from Twitter demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods that use textual information only."
Learning Geo-Social User Topical Profiles with Bayesian Hierarchical User Factorization,"Understanding user interests and expertise is a vital component toward creating rich user models for information personalization in social media, recommender systems and web search. To capture the pair-wise interactions between geo-location and user's topical profile in social-spatial systems, we propose the modeling of fine-grained and multi-dimensional user geo-topic profiles. We then propose a two-layered Bayesian hierarchical user factorization generative framework to overcome user heterogeneity and another enhanced model integrated with user's contextual information to alleviate multi-dimensional sparsity. Through extensive experiments, we find the proposed model leads to a 5\textasciitilde13% improvement in precision and recall over the alternative baselines and an additional 6\textasciitilde11% improvement with the integration of user's contexts."

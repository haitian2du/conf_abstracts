Multihop Attention Networks for Question Answer Matching,"Attention based neural network models have been successfully applied in answer selection, which is an important subtask of question answering (QA). These models often represent a question by a single vector and find its corresponding matches by attending to candidate answers. However, questions and answers might be related to each other in complicated ways which cannot be captured by single-vector representations. In this paper, we propose Multihop Attention Networks (MAN) which aim to uncover these complex relations for ranking question and answer pairs. Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the question into a single vector, instead we use multiple vectors which focus on different parts of the question for its overall semantic representation and apply multiple steps of attention to learn representations for the candidate answers. For each attention step, in addition to common attention mechanisms, we adopt sequential attention which utilizes context information for computing context-aware attention weights. Via extensive experiments, we show that MAN outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmark QA datasets. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of sequential attention over other attention mechanisms."
Ranking Documents by Answer-Passage Quality,"Evidence derived from passages that closely represent likely answers to a posed query can be useful input to the ranking process. Based on a novel use of Community Question Answering data, we present an approach for the creation of such passages. A general framework for extracting answer passages and estimating their quality is proposed, and this evidence is integrated into ranking models. Our experiments on two web collections show that such quality estimates from answer passages provide a strong indication of document relevance and compare favorably to previous passage-based methods. Combining such evidence can significantly improve over a set of state-of-the-art ranking models, including Quality-Biased Ranking, External Expansion, and a combination of both. A final ranking model that incorporates all quality estimates achieves further improvements on both collections."
Characterizing and Supporting Question Answering in Human-to-Human Communication,"Email continues to be one of the most important means of online communication. People spend a significant amount of time sending, reading, searching and responding to email in order to manage tasks, exchange information, etc. In this paper, we focus on information exchange over enterprise email in the form of questions and answers. We study a large scale publicly available email dataset to characterize information exchange via questions and answers in enterprise email. We augment our analysis with a survey to gain insights on the types of questions exchanged, when and how do people get back to them and whether this behavior is adequately supported by existing email management and search functionality. We leverage this understanding to define the task of extracting question/answer pairs from threaded email conversations. We propose a neural network based approach that matches the question to the answer considering comparisons at different levels of granularity. We also show that we can improve the performance by leveraging external data of question and answer pairs. We test our approach using a manually labeled email data collected using a crowd-sourcing annotation study. Our findings have implications for designing email clients and intelligent agents that support question answering and information lookup in email."

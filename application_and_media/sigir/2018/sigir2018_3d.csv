Adversarial Personalized Ranking for Recommendation,"Item recommendation is a personalized ranking task. To this end, many recommender systems optimize models with pairwise ranking objectives, such as the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). Using matrix Factorization (MF) - the most widely used model in recommendation - as a demonstration, we show that optimizing it with BPR leads to a recommender model that is not robust. In particular, we find that the resultant model is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on its model parameters, which implies the possibly large error in generalization. To enhance the robustness of a recommender model and thus improve its generalization performance, we propose a new optimization framework, namely Adversarial Personalized Ranking (APR). In short, our APR enhances the pairwise ranking method BPR by performing adversarial training. It can be interpreted as playing a minimax game, where the minimization of the BPR objective function meanwhile defends an adversary, which adds adversarial perturbations on model parameters to maximize the BPR objective function. To illustrate how it works, we implement APR on MF by adding adversarial perturbations on the embedding vectors of users and items. Extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of APR - by optimizing MF with APR, it outperforms BPR with a relative improvement of 11.2% on average and achieves state-of-the-art performance for item recommendation.

Turning Clicks into Purchases: Revenue Optimization for Product Search in E-Commerce,"In recent years, product search engines have emerged as a key factor for online businesses. According to a recent survey, over 55% of online customers begin their online shopping journey by searching on an E-Commerce (EC) website like Amazon as opposed to a generic web search engine like Google. Information retrieval research to date has been focused on optimizing search ranking algorithms for web documents while little attention has been paid to product search. There are several intrinsic differences between web search and product search that make the direct application of traditional search ranking algorithms to EC search platforms difficult. First, the success of web and product search is measured differently; one seeks to optimize for relevance while the other must optimize for both relevance and revenue. Second, when using real-world EC transaction data, there is no access to manually annotated labels. In this paper, we address these differences with a novel learning framework for EC product search called LETORIF (LEarning TO Rank with Implicit Feedback). In this framework, we utilize implicit user feedback signals (such as user clicks and purchases) and jointly model the different stages of the shopping journey to optimize for EC sales revenue. We conduct experiments on real-world EC transaction data and introduce a a new evaluation metric to estimate expected revenue after re-ranking. Experimental results show that LETORIF outperforms top competitors in improving purchase rates and total revenue earned."
Modeling Diverse Relevance Patterns in Ad-hoc Retrieval,"Assessing relevance between a query and a document is challenging in ad-hoc retrieval due to its diverse patterns, i.e., a document could be relevant to a query as a whole or partially as long as it provides sufficient information for users' need. Such diverse relevance patterns require an ideal retrieval model to be able to assess relevance in the right granularity adaptively. Unfortunately, most existing retrieval models compute relevance at a single granularity, either document-wide or passage-level, or use fixed combination strategy, restricting their ability in capturing diverse relevance patterns. In this work, we propose a data-driven method to allow relevance signals at different granularities to compete with each other for final relevance assessment. Specifically, we propose a HIerarchical Neural maTching model (HiNT) which consists of two stacked components, namely local matching layer and global decision layer. The local matching layer focuses on producing a set of local relevance signals by modeling the semantic matching between a query and each passage of a document. The global decision layer accumulates local signals into different granularities and allows them to compete with each other to decide the final relevance score.Experimental results demonstrate that our HiNT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval models significantly on benchmark ad-hoc retrieval datasets."

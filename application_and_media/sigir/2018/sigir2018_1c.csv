Dynamic Shard Cutoff Prediction for Selective Search,"Selective search architectures use resource selection algorithms such as Rank-S or Taily to rank index shards and determine how many to search for a given query. Most prior research evaluated solutions by their ability to improve efficiency without significantly reducing early-precision metrics such as [email protected] and [email protected] This paper recasts selective search as an early stage of a multi-stage retrieval architecture, which makes recall-oriented metrics more appropriate. A new algorithm is presented that predicts the number of shards that must be searched for a given query in order to meet recall-oriented goals. Decoupling shard ranking from deciding how many shards to search clarifies efficiency vs. effectiveness trade-offs, and enables them to be optimized independently. Experiments on two corpora demonstrate the value of this approach."
Modeling Long- and Short-Term Temporal Patterns with Deep Neural Networks,"Multivariate time series forecasting is an important machine learning problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online."
Neural Query Performance Prediction using Weak Supervision from Multiple Signals,"Predicting the performance of a search engine for a given query is a fundamental and challenging task in information retrieval. Accurate performance predictors can be used in various ways, such as triggering an action, choosing the most effective ranking function per query, or selecting the best variant from multiple query formulations. In this paper, we propose a general end-to-end query performance prediction framework based on neural networks, called NeuralQPP. Our framework consists of multiple components, each learning a representation suitable for performance prediction. These representations are then aggregated and fed into a prediction sub-network. We train our models with multiple weak supervision signals, which is an unsupervised learning approach that uses the existing unsupervised performance predictors using weak labels. We also propose a simple yet effective component dropout technique to regularize our model. Our experiments on four newswire and web collections demonstrate that NeuralQPP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, in nearly every case. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze the effectiveness of each component, each weak supervision signal, and all resulting combinations in our experiments."
Combined Regression and Tripletwise Learning for Conversion Rate Prediction in Real-Time Bidding Advertising,"In real-time bidding advertising (RTB), the buyers bid for individual advertisement impressions provided by publishers in real time. The final goal of the buyers is to maximize the return on their investment. To gain higher returns, buyers prefer to first purchase more conversion impressions than click-only ones and then purchase more click-only impressions prior to non-click ones. Simultaneously, to reduce the expense, they need to accurately estimate a reasonable bid price, the predicted precision of which depends on the precision of the predicted conversion rate (CVR) or predicted click-through rate (CTR). Therefore, the predicted CVR or predicted CTR must provide not only good ranking values but also correct regression estimations. This paper is focused on the CVR estimation problem for buy-sides in RTB and a combined regression and tripletwise ranking method (CRT) is proposed that jointly considers regression loss and tripletwise ranking loss to estimate the CVR. This method attempts to rank conversion impressions above click-only ones and simultaneously rank click-only impressions above non-click ones. Meanwhile, through simultaneously utilizing the historical conversion and click information to alleviate sparsity, the CRT method is also aimed to achieve a good two category-ranking performance, as well as a good regression performance for predicting the CVR."

Constructing an Interaction Behavior Model for Web Image Search,"User interaction behavior is a valuable source of implicit relevance feedback. In Web image search a different type of search result presentation is used than in general Web search, which leads to different interaction mechanisms and user behavior. For example, image search results are self-contained, so that users do not need to click the results to view the landing page as in general Web search, which generates sparse click data. Also, two-dimensional result placement instead of a linear result list makes browsing behaviors more complex. Thus, it is hard to apply standard user behavior models (e.g., click models) developed for general Web search to Web image search. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive image search user behavior analysis using data from a lab-based user study as well as data from a commercial search log. We then propose a novel interaction behavior model, called grid-based user browsing model (GUBM), whose design is motivated by observations from our data analysis. GUBM can both capture users' interaction behavior, including cursor hovering, and alleviate position bias. The advantages of GUBM are two-fold: (1) It is based on an unsupervised learning method and does not need manually annotated data for training. (2) It is based on user interaction features on search engine result pages (SERPs) and is easily transferable to other scenarios that have a grid-based interface such as video search engines. We conduct extensive experiments to test the performance of our model using a large-scale commercial image search log. Experimental results show that in terms of behavior prediction (perplexity), and topical relevance and image quality (normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)), GUBM outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models as well as the original ranking. We make the implementation of GUBM and related datasets publicly available for future studies."
Between Clicks and Satisfaction: Study on Multi-Phase User Preferences and Satisfaction for Online News Reading,"Click signal has been widely used for designing and evaluating interactive information systems, which is taken as the indicator of user preference. However, click signal does not capture post-click user experience. Very commonly, the user first clicked an item and then found it is not what he wanted after reading its content, which shows there is a gap between user click and user actual preference. Previous studies on web search have incorporated other user behaviors, such as dwell time, to reduce the gap. Unfortunately, for other scenarios such as recommendation and online news reading, there still lacks a thorough understanding of the relationship between click and user preference, and the corresponding reasons which are the focus of this work. Based on an in-depth laboratory user study of online news reading scenario in the mobile environment, we show that click signal does not align with user preference. Besides, we find that user preference changes frequently, hence preferences in three phases are proposed: Before-Read Preference, After-Read Preference and Post-task Preference. In addition, the statistic analysis shows that the changes are highly related to news quality and the context of user interactions. Meanwhile, many other user behaviors, like viewport time, dwell time, and read speed, are found reflecting user preference in different phases. Furthermore, with the help of various kinds of user behaviors, news quality, and interaction context, we build an effective model to predict whether the user actually likes the clicked news. Finally, we replace binary click signals of traditional click-based evaluation metrics, like Click-Through Rate, with the predicted item-level preference, and significant improvements are achieved in estimating the user's list-level satisfaction. Our work sheds light on the understanding of user click behaviors and provides a method for better estimating user interest and satisfaction. The proposed model could also be helpful to various recommendation tasks in mobile scenarios."
The Effects of Manipulating Task Determinability on Search Behaviors and Outcomes,"An important area of IR research involves understanding how task characteristics influence search behaviors and outcomes. Task complexity is one characteristic that has received considerable attention. One view of task complexity is through the lens of a priori determinability -- the level of uncertainty about task outcomes and processes experienced by the searcher. In this work, we manipulated the determinability of comparative tasks. Our task manipulation involved modifying the scope of the task by specifying exact items and/or exact (objective or subjective) dimensions to consider as part of the task. This paper reports on a within-subject study (N=144) where we investigated how our task manipulation influenced participants' perceptions, levels of engagement, search effort, and choice of search strategies. Our results suggest a complex relationship between task scope, determinability, and different outcome measures. Our most open-ended tasks were perceived to have low determinability (high uncertainty), but were the least challenging for participants due to satisficing. Furthermore, narrowing the scope of tasks by specifying items had a different effect than by specifying dimensions. Specifying items increased the task determinability (lower uncertainty) and made the task easier, while specifying dimensions did not increase the task determinability and made the task more challenging. A qualitative analysis of participants' queries suggests that searching for dimensions is more challenging than for items. Finally, we observed subtle differences between objective and subjective dimensions. We discuss implications for the design of IIR studies and tools to support users."

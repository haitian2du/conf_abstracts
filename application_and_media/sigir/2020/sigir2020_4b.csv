LightGCN: Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network for Recommendation,"Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has become new state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in GCNs -- feature transformation and nonlinear activation -- contribute little to the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds to the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance."
GAME: Learning Graphical and Attentive Multi-view Embeddings for Occasional Group Recommendation,"Group recommendation aims to suggest preferred items to a group of users rather than to an individual user. Most existing methods on group recommendation directly learn theinherent interests of groups and users orinherent features of items, i.e., independently modeling the inherent embeddings of groups, users or items. However, the independent view severely suffers from the cold-start problem when making recommendations for occasional groups that are temporally formed by a set of users and have few interactions on items. Actually, the groups, users and items are interdependent because they interact with one another. The interdependencies constitute an interaction graph that provides multiple views to model the embeddings of groups, users and items from their interacting counterparts to improve recommendation for occasional groups. To this end, we propose a model, named GAME to learn the Graphical and Attentive Multi-view Embeddings (i.e., representations) for the groups, users and items from the independent view and counterpart views based on the interaction graph. In the counterpart views, the embedding of a group, user or item is aggregated from the interacting counterparts based on an attention mechanism that derives the adaptive weight for each counterpart. For instance, a user's embedding may be aggregated from her interacting items or groups. Further, GAME applies neural collaborative filtering to investigate the interactions between the multi-view embeddings of groups (or users) and items for group recommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets. The experimental results show that GAME outperforms other state-of-the-art models, especially on both cold-start groups (i.e., occasional groups) and cold-start items."
Multi-behavior Recommendation with Graph Convolutional Networks,"Traditional recommendation models that usually utilize only one type of user-item interaction are faced with serious data sparsity or cold start issues. Multi-behavior recommendation taking use of multiple types of user-item interactions, such as clicks and favorites, can serve as an effective solution. Early efforts towards multi-behavior recommendation fail to capture behaviors' different influence strength on target behavior. They also ignore behaviors' semantics which is implied in multi-behavior data. Both of these two limitations make the data not fully exploited for improving the recommendation performance on the target behavior."
GAG: Global Attributed Graph Neural Network for Streaming Session-based Recommendation,"Streaming session-based recommendation (SSR) is a challenging task that requires the recommender system to do the session-based recommendation (SR) in the streaming scenario. In the real-world applications of e-commerce and social media, a sequence of user-item interactions generated within a certain period are grouped as a session, and these sessions consecutively arrive in the form of streams. Most of the recent SR research has focused on the static setting where the training data is first acquired and then used to train a session-based recommender model. They need several epochs of training over the whole dataset, which is infeasible in the streaming setting. Besides, they can hardly well capture long-term user interests because of the neglect or the simple usage of the user information. Although some streaming recommendation strategies have been proposed recently, they are designed for streams of individual interactions rather than streams of sessions. In this paper, we propose a G lobal A ttributed G raph (GAG) neural network model with a Wasserstein reservoir for the SSR problem. On one hand, when a new session arrives, a session graph with a global attribute is constructed based on the current session and its associate user. Thus, the GAG can take both the global attribute and the current session into consideration to learn more comprehensive representations of the session and the user, yielding a better performance in the recommendation. On the other hand, for the adaptation to the streaming session scenario, a Wasserstein reservoir is proposed to help preserve a representative sketch of the historical data. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets have been conducted to verify the superiority of the GAG model compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
Joint Item Recommendation and Attribute Inference: An Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network Approach,"In many recommender systems, users and items are associated with attributes, and users show preferences to items. The attribute information describes users'(items') characteristics and has a wide range of applications, such as user profiling, item annotation, and feature-enhanced recommendation. As annotating user (item) attributes is a labor intensive task, the attribute values are often incomplete with many missing attribute values. Therefore, item recommendation and attribute inference have become two main tasks in these platforms. Researchers have long converged that user(item) attributes and the preference behavior are highly correlated. Some researchers proposed to leverage one kind of data for the remaining task, and showed to improve performance. Nevertheless, these models either neglected the incompleteness of user~(item) attributes or regarded the correlation of the two tasks with simple models, leading to suboptimal performance of these two tasks."
GCN-Based User Representation Learning for Unifying Robust Recommendation and Fraudster Detection,"In recent years, recommender system has become an indispensable function in all e-commerce platforms. The review rating data for a recommender system typically comes from open platforms, which may attract a group of malicious users to deliberately insert fake feedback in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their favour. The presence of such attacks may violate modeling assumptions that high-quality data is always available and these data truly reflect users' interests and preferences. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to construct a robust recommender system that is able to generate stable recommendations even in the presence of shilling attacks. In this paper, we propose GraphRfi - a GCN-based user representation learning framework to perform robust recommendation and fraudster detection in a unified way. In its end-to-end learning process, the probability of a user being identified as a fraudster in the fraudster detection component automatically determines the contribution of this user's rating data in the recommendation component; while the prediction error outputted in the recommendation component acts as an important feature in the fraudster detection component. Thus, these two components can mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our GraphRfi in the two tasks - robust rating prediction and fraudster detection. Furthermore, the proposed GraphRfi is validated to be more robust to the various types of shilling attacks over the state-of-the-art recommender systems."

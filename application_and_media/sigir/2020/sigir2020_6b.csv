Domain-Adaptive Neural Automated Essay Scoring,"Automated essay scoring (AES) is a promising, yet challenging task. Current state-of-the-art AES models ignore the domain difference and cannot effectively leverage data from different domains. In this paper, we propose a domain-adaptive framework to improve the domain adaptability of AES models. We design two domain-independent self-supervised tasks and jointly train them with the AES task simultaneously. The self-supervised tasks enable the model to capture the shared knowledge across different domains and act as the regularization to induce a shared feature space. We further propose to enhance the model's robustness to domain variation via a novel domain adversarial training technique. The main idea of the proposed domain adversarial training is to train the model with small well-designed perturbations to make the model robust to domain variation. We obtain the perturbation via a variation of the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and cross-domain experiments on the ASAP dataset. We also show that the proposed domain adaptation framework is architecture-free and can be successfully applied to different models."
ADORE: Aspect Dependent Online REview Labeling for Review Generation,"Online reviews play a critical role in persuading or dissuading users when making purchase decisions. And yet very few users take the time to write helpful reviews. Encouragingly, recent advances in deep neural networks offer good potential to produce review-like natural language content. However, there is a lack of large, high-quality labeled data at both the aspect and sentiment level for training. Hence, toward enabling a writing assistant framework to help users post online reviews, this paper proposes a scalable labeling method for bootstrapping aspect and sentiment labels.Concretely, the proposed approach ? Aspect Dependent Online RE-views (ADORE) - leverages the underlying distribution of reviews and a small seed set of labeled data through carefully designed review segmentation and label assignment. We then show how these labels can inform a generative model to produce aspect and sentiment-aware reviews. We study the effectiveness of ADORE under various scenarios such as how end-users perceive the quality of the labels and aspect-aware generated reviews. Our experiments indicate that the proposed effective labeling process along with a regularized joint generative model lead to high quality reviews with 90% accuracy."
Finding the Best of Both Worlds: Faster and More Robust Top-k Document Retrieval,"Many top-k document retrieval strategies have been proposed based on the WAND and MaxScore heuristics and yet, from recent work, it is surprisingly difficult to identify the ""fastest"" strategy. This becomes even more challenging when considering various retrieval criteria, like different ranking models and values of k. In this paper, we conduct the first extensive comparison between ten effective strategies, many of which were never compared before to our knowledge, examining their efficiency under five representative ranking models. Based on a careful analysis of the comparison, we propose LazyBM, a remarkably simple retrieval strategy that bridges the gap between the best performing WAND-based and MaxScore-based approaches. Empirically, LazyBM considerably outperforms all of the considered strategies across ranking models, values of k, and index configurations under both mean and tail query latency."
Recommending Podcasts for Cold-Start Users Based on Music Listening and Taste,"Recommender systems are increasingly used to predict and serve content that aligns with user taste, yet the task of matching new users with relevant content remains a challenge. We consider podcasting to be an emerging medium with rapid growth in adoption, and discuss challenges that arise when applying traditional recommendation approaches to address the cold-start problem. Using music consumption behavior, we examine two main techniques in inferring Spotify users preferences over more than 200k podcasts. Our results show significant improvements in consumption of up to 50% for both offline and online experiments. We provide extensive analysis on model performance and examine the degree to which music data as an input source introduces bias in recommendations."
Learning with Weak Supervision for Email Intent Detection,"Email remains one of the most frequently used means of online communication. People spend significant amount of time every day on emails to exchange information, manage tasks and schedule events. Previous work has studied different ways for improving email productivity by prioritizing emails, suggesting automatic replies or identifying intents to recommend appropriate actions. The problem has been mostly posed as a supervised learning problem where models of different complexities were proposed to classify an email message into a predefined taxonomy of intents or classes. The need for labeled data has always been one of the largest bottlenecks in training supervised models. This is especially the case for many real-world tasks, such as email intent classification, where large scale annotated examples are either hard to acquire or unavailable due to privacy or data access constraints. Email users often take actions in response to intents expressed in an email (e.g., setting up a meeting in response to an email with a scheduling request). Such actions can be inferred from user interaction logs. In this paper, we propose to leverage user actions as a source of weak supervision, in addition to a limited set of annotated examples, to detect intents in emails. We develop an end-to-end robust deep neural network model for email intent identification that leverages both clean annotated data and noisy weak supervision along with a self-paced learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on three different intent detection tasks show that our approach can effectively leverage the weakly supervised data to improve intent detection in emails."
3D Self-Attention for Unsupervised Video Quantization,"Unsupervised video quantization is to compress the original videos to compact binary codes so that video retrieval can be conducted in an efficient way. In this paper, we make a first attempt to combine quantization method with video retrieval called 3D-UVQ, which obtains high retrieval accuracy with low storage cost. In the proposed framework, we address two main problems: 1) how to design an effective pipeline to perceive video contextual information for video features extraction; and 2) how to quantize these features for efficient retrieval. To tackle these problems, we propose a 3D self-attention module to exploit the spatial and temporal contextual information, where each pixel is influenced by its surrounding pixels. By taking a further recurrent operation, each pixel can finally capture the global context from all pixels. Then, we propose gradient-based residual quantization which consists of several quantization blocks to approximate the features gradually. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts. Ablation study shows that both the 3D self-attention module and the gradient-based residual quantization can improve the performance of retrieval. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/brownwolf/3D-UVQ."

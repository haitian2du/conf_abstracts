Jointly Non-Sampling Learning for Knowledge Graph Enhanced Recommendation,"Knowledge graph (KG) contains well-structured external information and has shown to be effective for high-quality recommendation. However, existing KG enhanced recommendation methods have largely focused on exploring advanced neural network architectures to better investigate the structural information of KG. While for model learning, these methods mainly rely on Negative Sampling (NS) to optimize the models for both KG embedding task and recommendation task. Since NS is not robust (e.g., sampling a small fraction of negative instances may lose lots of useful information), it is reasonable to argue that these methods are insufficient to capture collaborative information among users, items, and entities."
AutoGroup: Automatic Feature Grouping for Modelling Explicit High-Order Feature Interactions in CTR Prediction,"Modelling feature interactions is key in Click-Through Rate (CTR) predictions. State-of-the-art models usually include explicit feature interactions to better model non-linearity in a deep network, but enumerating all feature combinations of high orders is not efficient and brings challenges to network optimization. In this work, we use AutoML to seek useful high-order feature interactions to train on without manual feature selection. For this purpose, an end-to-end model, AutoGroup, is proposed, which casts the selection of feature interactions as a structural optimization problem. In a nutshell, AutoGroup first automatically groups useful features into a number of feature sets. Then, it generates interactions of any order from these feature sets using a novel interaction function. The main contribution of AutoGroup is that it performs both dimensionality reduction and feature selection which are not seen in previous models. Offline experiments on three public large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of AutoGroup over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, a ten-day online A/B test verifies that AutoGroup can be reliably deployed in production and outperform the commercial baseline by 10% on average in terms of CTR and CVR."
KERL: A Knowledge-Guided Reinforcement Learning Model for Sequential Recommendation,"For sequential recommendation, it is essential to capture and predict future or long-term user preference for generating accurate recommendation over time. To improve the predictive capacity, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) for developing effective sequential recommenders. However, user-item interaction data is likely to be sparse, complicated and time-varying. It is not easy to directly apply RL techniques to improve the performance of sequential recommendation."
CKAN: Collaborative Knowledge-aware Attentive Network for Recommender Systems,"Since it can effectively address the problem of sparsity and cold start of collaborative filtering, knowledge graph (KG) is widely studied and employed as side information in the field of recommender systems. However, most of existing KG-based recommendation methods mainly focus on how to effectively encode the knowledge associations in KG, without highlighting the crucial collaborative signals which are latent in user-item interactions. As such, the learned embeddings underutilize the two kinds of pivotal information and are insufficient to effectively represent the latent semantics of users and items in vector space."
CATN: Cross-Domain Recommendation for Cold-Start Users via Aspect Transfer Network,"In a large recommender system, the products (or items) could be in many different categories or domains. Given two relevant domains (e.g., Book and Movie), users may have interactions with items in one domain but not in the other domain. To the latter, these users are considered as cold-start users. How to effectively transfer users' preferences based on their interactions from one domain to the other relevant domain, is the key issue in cross-domain recommendation. Inspired by the advances made in review-based recommendation, we propose to model user preference transfer at aspect-level derived from reviews. To this end, we propose a cross-domain recommendation framework via aspect transfer network for cold-start users (named CATN). CATN is devised to extract multiple aspects for each user and each item from their review documents, and learn aspect correlations across domains with an attention mechanism. In addition, we further exploit auxiliary reviews from like-minded users to enhance a user's aspect representations. Then, an end-to-end optimization framework is utilized to strengthen the robustness of our model. On real-world datasets, the proposed CATN outperforms SOTA models significantly in terms of rating prediction accuracy. Further analysis shows that our model is able to reveal user aspect connections across domains at a fine level of granularity, making the recommendation explainable."
Leveraging Demonstrations for Reinforcement Recommendation Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs,"Knowledge graphs have been widely adopted to improve recommendation accuracy. The multi-hop user-item connections on knowledge graphs also endow reasoning about why an item is recommended. However, reasoning on paths is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Traditional recommendation methods usually adopt brute-force methods to find feasible paths, which results in issues related to convergence and explainability. In this paper, we address these issues by better supervising the path finding process. The key idea is to extract imperfect path demonstrations with minimum labeling efforts and effectively leverage these demonstrations to guide path finding. In particular, we design a demonstration-based knowledge graph reasoning framework for explainable recommendation. We also propose an ADversarial Actor-Critic (ADAC) model for the demonstration-guided path finding. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show that our method converges more quickly than the state-of-the-art baseline and achieves better recommendation accuracy and explainability."
Incorporating Scenario Knowledge into A Unified Fine-tuning Architecture for Event Representation,"Given an occurred event, human can easily predict the next event or reason the preceding event, yet which is difficult for machine to perform such event reasoning. Event representation bridges the connection and targets to model the process of event reasoning as a machine-readable format, which then can support a wide range of applications in information retrieval, e.g., question answering and information extraction. Existing work mainly resorts to a joint training to integrate all levels of training loss in event chains by a simple loss summation, which is easily trapped into a local optimum. In addition, the scenario knowledge in event chains is not well investigated for event representation. In this paper, we propose a unified fine-tuning architecture, incorporated with scenario knowledge for event representation, i.e., UniFA-S, which mainly consists of a unified fine-tuning architecture (UniFA) and a scenario-level variational auto-encoder (S-VAE). In detail, UniFA employs a multi-step fine-tuning to integrate all levels of training and S-VAE applies a stochastic variable to implicitly represent the scenario-level knowledge. We evaluate our proposal from two aspects, i.e., the representation and inference abilities. For the representation ability, our ensemble model UniFA-S can beat state-of-the-art baselines for two similarity tasks. For the inference ability, UniFA-S can outperform the best baseline, achieving 4.1%-8.2% improvements in terms of accuracy for various inference tasks."

Humor Detection in Product Question Answering Systems,"Community question-answering (CQA) has been established as a prominent web service enabling users to post questions and get answers from the community. Product Question Answering (PQA) is a special CQA framework where questions are asked (and are answered) in the context of a specific product. Naturally, humorous questions are integral part of such platforms, especially as some products attract humor due to their unreasonable price, their peculiar functionality, or in cases that users emphasize their critical point-of-view through humor. Detecting humorous questions in such systems is important for sellers, to better understand user engagement with their products. It is also important to signal users about flippancy of humorous questions, and that answers for such questions should be taken with a grain of salt."
Training Curricula for Open Domain Answer Re-Ranking,"In precision-oriented tasks like answer ranking, it is more important to rank many relevant answers highly than to retrieve all relevant answers. It follows that a good ranking strategy would be to learn how to identify the easiest correct answers first (i.e., assign a high ranking score to answers that have characteristics that usually indicate relevance, and a low ranking score to those with characteristics that do not), before incorporating more complex logic to handle difficult cases (e.g., semantic matching or reasoning). In this work, we apply this idea to the training of neural answer rankers using curriculum learning. We propose several heuristics to estimate the difficulty of a given training sample. We show that the proposed heuristics can be used to build a training curriculum that down-weights difficult samples early in the training process. As the training process progresses, our approach gradually shifts to weighting all samples equally, regardless of difficulty. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed idea on three answer ranking datasets. Results show that our approach leads to superior performance of two leading neural ranking architectures, namely BERT and ConvKNRM, using both pointwise and pairwise losses. When applied to a BERT-based ranker, our method yields up to a 4% improvement in MRR and a 9% improvement in [email protected] (compared to the model trained without a curriculum). This results in models that can achieve comparable performance to more expensive state-of-the-art techniques."
Open-Retrieval Conversational Question Answering,"Conversational search is one of the ultimate goals of information retrieval. Recent research approaches conversational search by simplified settings of response ranking and conversational question answering, where an answer is either selected from a given candidate set or extracted from a given passage. These simplifications neglect the fundamental role of retrieval in conversational search. To address this limitation, we introduce an open-retrieval conversational question answering (ORConvQA) setting, where we learn to retrieve evidence from a large collection before extracting answers, as a further step towards building functional conversational search systems. We create a dataset, OR-QuAC, to facilitate research on ORConvQA. We build an end-to-end system for ORConvQA, featuring a retriever, a reranker, and a reader that are all based on Transformers. Our extensive experiments on OR-QuAC demonstrate that a learnable retriever is crucial for ORConvQA. We further show that our system can make a substantial improvement when we enable history modeling in all system components. Moreover, we show that the reranker component contributes to the model performance by providing a regularization effect. Finally, further in-depth analyses are performed to provide new insights into ORConvQA."
Learning to Ask Screening Questions for Job Postings,"At LinkedIn, we want to create economic opportunity for everyone in the global workforce. A critical aspect of this goal is matching jobs with qualified applicants. To improve hiring efficiency and reduce the need to manually screening each applicant, we develop a new product where recruiters can ask screening questions online so that they can filter qualified candidates easily. To add screening questions to all 20M active jobs at Linked In, we propose a new task that aims to automatically generate screening questions for a given job posting. To solve the task of generating screening questions, we develop a two-stage deep learning model called Job2Questions, where we apply a deep learning model to detect intent from the text description, and then rank the detected intents by their importance based on other contextual features. Since this is a new product with no historical data, we employ deep transfer learning to train complex models with limited training data. We launched the screening question product and our AI models to LinkedIn users and observed significant impact in the job marketplace. During our online A/B test, we observed +53.10% screening question suggestion acceptance rate, +22.17% job coverage, +190% recruiter-applicant interaction, and +11 Net Promoter Score. In sum, the deployed Job2Questions model helps recruiters to find qualified applicants and job seekers to find jobs they are qualified for."
Match²: A Matching over Matching Model for Similar Question Identification,"Community Question Answering (CQA) has become a primary means for people to acquire knowledge, where people are free to ask questions or submit answers. To enhance the efficiency of the service, similar question identification becomes a core task in CQA which aims to find a similar question from the archived repository whenever a new question is asked. However, it has long been a challenge to properly measure the similarity between two questions due to the inherent variation of natural language, i.e., there could be different ways to ask a same question or different questions sharing similar expressions. To alleviate this problem, it is natural to involve the existing answers for the enrichment of the archived questions. Traditional methods typically take aone-side usage, which leverages the answer as some expanded representation of the corresponding question. Unfortunately, this may introduce unexpected noises into the similarity computation since answers are often long and diverse, leading to inferior performance. In this work, we propose atwo-side usage, which leverages the answer as a bridge of the two questions. The key idea is based on our observation that similar questions could be addressed by similar parts of the answer while different questions may not. In other words, we can compare the matching patterns of the two questions over the same answer to measure their similarity. In this way, we propose a novel matching over matching model, namely Match2, which compares the matching patterns between two question-answer pairs for similar question identification. Empirical experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on the similar question identification task."
Answer Ranking for Product-Related Questions via Multiple Semantic Relations Modeling,"Many E-commerce sites now offer product-specific question answering platforms for users to communicate with each other by posting and answering questions during online shopping. However, the multiple answers provided by ordinary users usually vary diversely in their qualities and thus need to be appropriately ranked for each question to improve user satisfaction. It can be observed that product reviews usually provide useful information for a given question, and thus can assist the ranking process. In this paper, we investigate the answer ranking problem for product-related questions, with the relevant reviews treated as auxiliary information that can be exploited for facilitating the ranking. We propose an answer ranking model named MUSE which carefully models multiple semantic relations among the question, answers, and relevant reviews. Specifically, MUSE constructs a multi-semantic relation graph with the question, each answer, and each review snippet as nodes. Then a customized graph convolutional neural network is designed for explicitly modeling the semantic relevance between the question and answers, the content consistency among answers, and the textual entailment between answers and reviews. Extensive experiments on real-world E-commerce datasets across three product categories show that our proposed model achieves superior performance on the concerned answer ranking task."

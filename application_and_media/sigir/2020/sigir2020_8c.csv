HME: A Hyperbolic Metric Embedding Approach for Next-POI Recommendation,"With the increasing popularity of location-aware social media services, next-Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has gained significant research interest. The key challenge of next-POI recommendation is to precisely learn users' sequential movements from sparse check-in data. To this end, various embedding methods have been proposed to learn the representations of check-in data in the Euclidean space. However, their ability to learn complex patterns, especially hierarchical structures, is limited by the dimensionality of the Euclidean space. To this end, we propose a new research direction that aims to learn the representations of check-in activities in a hyperbolic space, which yields two advantages. First, it can effectively capture the underlying hierarchical structures, which are implied by the power-law distributions of user movements. Second, it provides high representative strength and enables the check-in data to be effectively represented in a low-dimensional space. Specifically, to solve the next-POI recommendation task, we propose a novel hyperbolic metric embedding (HME) model, which projects the check-in data into a hyperbolic space. The HME jointly captures sequential transition, user preference, category and region information in a unified approach by learning embeddings in a shared hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore a non-Euclidean embedding model for next-POI recommendation. We conduct extensive experiments on three check-in datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our hyperbolic embedding approach over the state-of-the-art next-POI recommendation algorithms. Moreover, we conduct experiments on another four online transaction datasets for next-item recommendation to further demonstrate the generality of our proposed model."
Dual Sequential Network for Temporal Sets Prediction,"Many sequential behaviors such as purchasing items from time to time, selecting courses in different terms, collecting event logs periodically could be formalized as sequential sets of actions or elements, namely temporal sets. Predicting the subsequent set according to historical sequence of sets could help us make better producing, scheduling, or operating decisions. However, most of the existing methods were designed for predicting time series or temporal events, which could not be directly used for temporal sets prediction due to the difficulties of multi-level representations of items and sets, complex temporal dependencies of sets, and evolving dynamics of sequential behaviors. To address these issues, this paper provides a novel sets prediction method, called DSNTSP (Dual Sequential Network for Temporal Sets Prediction). Our model first learns both item-level representations and set-level representations of set sequences separately based on a transformer framework. Then, a co-transformer module is proposed to capture the multiple temporal dependencies of items and sets. Last, a gated neural module is designed to predict the subsequent set by fusing all the multi-level correlations and multiple temporal dependencies of items and sets. The experimental results on real-world data sets show that our methods lead to significant and consistent improvements as compared to other methods."
Group-Aware Long- and Short-Term Graph Representation Learning for Sequential Group Recommendation,"Sequential recommendation and group recommendation are two important branches in the field of recommender system. While considerable efforts have been devoted to these two branches in an independent way, we combine them by proposing the novel sequential group recommendation problem which enables modeling group dynamic representations and is crucial for achieving better group recommendation performance. The major challenge of the problem is how to effectively learn dynamic group representations based on the sequential user-item interactions of group members in the past time frames. To address this, we devise a Group-aware Long- and Short-term Graph Representation Learning approach, namely GLS-GRL, for sequential group recommendation. Specifically, for a target group, we construct a group-aware long-term graph to capture user-item interactions and item-item co-occurrence in the whole history, and a group-aware short-term graph to contain the same information regarding only the current time frame. Based on the graphs, GLS-GRL performs graph representation learning to obtain long-term and short-term user representations, and further adaptively fuse them to gain integrated user representations. Finally, group representations are obtained by a constrained user-interacted attention mechanism which encodes the correlations between group members. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GLS-GRL achieves better performance than several strong alternatives coming from sequential recommendation and group recommendation methods, validating the effectiveness of the core components in GLS-GRL."
Time Matters: Sequential Recommendation with Complex Temporal Information,"Incorporating temporal information into recommender systems has recently attracted increasing attention from both the industrial and academic research communities. Existing methods mostly reduce the temporal information of behaviors to behavior sequences for subsequently RNN-based modeling. In such a simple manner, crucial time-related signals have been largely neglected. This paper aims to systematically investigate the effects of the temporal information in sequential recommendations. In particular, we firstly discover two elementary temporal patterns of user behaviors: ""absolute time patterns'' and ""relative time patterns'', where the former highlights user time-sensitive behaviors, e.g., people may frequently interact with specific products at certain time point, and the latter indicates how time interval influences the relationship between two actions. For seamlessly incorporating these information into a unified model, we devise a neural architecture that jointly learns those temporal patterns to model user dynamic preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model, comparing with the state-of-the-arts."
Parameter-Efficient Transfer from Sequential Behaviors for User Modeling and Recommendation,"Inductive transfer learning has had a big impact on computer vision and NLP domains but has not been used in the area of recommender systems. Even though there has been a large body of research on generating recommendations based on modeling user-item interaction sequences, few of them attempt to represent and transfer these models for serving downstream tasks where only limited data exists."
How to Retrain Recommender System?: A Sequential Meta-Learning Method,"Practical recommender systems need be periodically retrained to refresh the model with new interaction data. To pursue high model fidelity, it is usually desirable to retrain the model on both historical and new data, since it can account for both long-term and short-term user preference. However, a full model retraining could be very time-consuming and memory-costly, especially when the scale of historical data is large. In this work, we study the model retraining mechanism for recommender systems, a topic of high practical values but has been relatively little explored in the research community."

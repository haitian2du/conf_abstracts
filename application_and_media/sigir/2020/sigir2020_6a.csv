How Dataset Characteristics Affect the Robustness of Collaborative Recommendation Models,"Shilling attacks against collaborative filtering (CF) models are characterized by several fake user profiles mounted on the system by an adversarial party to harvest recommendation outcomes toward a malicious desire. The vulnerability of CF models is directly tied with their reliance on the underlying interaction data ---like user-item rating matrix (URM) --- to train their models and their inherent inability to distinguish genuine profiles from non-genuine ones. The majority of works conducted so far for analyzing shilling attacks mainly focused on properties such as confronted recommendation models, recommendation outputs, and even users under attack. The under-researched element has been the impact of data characteristics on the effectiveness of shilling attacks on CF models."
DPLCF: Differentially Private Local Collaborative Filtering,"Most existing recommender systems leverage users' complete original behavioral logs, which are collected from mobile devices and stored by the service provider and further fed into recommendation models. This may lead to a high risk of privacy leakage since the recommendation service provider may be trustless. Despite many research efforts on privacy-aware recommendation, the problem of building an effective recommender system completely preserving user privacy is still open."
Content-aware Neural Hashing for Cold-start Recommendation,"Content-aware recommendation approaches are essential for providing meaningful recommendations for new (i.e.,cold-start) items in a recommender system. We present a content-aware neural hashing-based collaborative filtering approach (NeuHash-CF), which generates binary hash codes for users and items, such that the highly efficient Hamming distance can be used for estimating user-item relevance. NeuHash-CF is modelled as an autoencoder architecture, consisting of two joint hashing components for generating user and item hash codes. Inspired from semantic hashing, the item hashing component generates a hash code directly from an item's content information (i.e., it generates cold-start and seen item hash codes in the same manner). This contrasts existing state-of-the-art models, which treat the two item cases separately. The user hash codes are generated directly based on user id, through learning a user embedding matrix. We show experimentally that NeuHash-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 12% NDCG and 13% MRR in cold-start recommendation settings, and up to 4% in both NDCG and MRR in standard settings where all items are present while training. Our approach uses 2-4x shorter hash codes, while obtaining the same or better performance compared to the state of the art, thus consequently also enabling a notable storage reduction."
Meta Matrix Factorization for Federated Rating Predictions,"With distinct privacy protection advantages, federated recommendation is becoming increasingly feasible to store data locally in devices and federally train recommender models. However, previous work on federated recommender systems does not take full account of the limitations of storage, RAM, energy and communication bandwidth in the mobile environment. Their model scales are too big to run easily in mobile devices. Moreover, existing federated recommenders need to fine-tune recommendation models in each device, which makes them hard to effectively exploit collaborative filtering (CF) information among users/devices."
The Impact of More Transparent Interfaces on Behavior in Personalized Recommendation,"Many interactive online systems, such as social media platforms or news sites, provide personalized experiences through recommendations or news feed customization based on people's feedback and engagement on individual items (e.g., liking items). In this paper, we investigate how we can support a greater degree of user control in such systems by changing the way the system allows people to gauge the consequences of their feedback actions. To this end, we consider two important aspects of how the system responds to feedback actions: (i) immediacy, i.e., how quickly the system responds with an update, and (ii) visibility, i.e., whether or not changes will get highlighted. We used both an in-lab qualitative study and a large-scale crowd-sourced study to examine the impact of these factors on people's reported preferences and observed behavioral metrics. We demonstrate that UX design which enables people to preview the impact of their actions and highlights changes results in a higher reported transparency, an overall preference for this design, and a greater selectivity in which items are liked."
Disentangled Graph Collaborative Filtering,"Learning informative representations of users and items from the interaction data is of crucial importance to collaborative filtering (CF). Present embedding functions exploit user-item relationships to enrich the representations, evolving from a single user-item instance to the holistic interaction graph. Nevertheless, they largely model the relationships in a uniform manner, while neglecting the diversity of user intents on adopting the items, which could be to pass time, for interest, or shopping for others like families. Such uniform approach to model user interests easily results in suboptimal representations, failing to model diverse relationships and disentangle user intents in representations."

What Makes a Top-Performing Precision Medicine Search Engine? Tracing Main System Features in a Systematic Way,"From 2017 to 2019 the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) held a challenge task on precision medicine using documents from medical publications (PubMed) and clinical trials. Despite lots of performance measurements carried out in these evaluation campaigns, the scientific community is still pretty unsure about the impact individual system features and their weights have on the overall system performance. In order to overcome this explanatory gap, we first determined optimal feature configurations using the Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration (SMAC) program and applied its output to a BM25-based search engine. We then ran an ablation study to systematically assess the individual contributions of relevant system features: BM25 parameters, query type and weighting schema, query expansion, stop word filtering, and keyword boosting. For evaluation, we employed the gold standard data from the three TREC Precision Medicine (TREC-PM) installments to evaluate the effectiveness of different features using the commonly shared infNDCG metric."
Accelerated Convergence for Counterfactual Learning to Rank,"Counterfactual Learning To Rank (LTR) algorithms learn a ranking model from logged user interactions, often collected using a production system. Employing such an offline learning approach has many benefits compared to an online one, but it is challenging as user feedback often contains high levels of bias. Unbiased LTR uses Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to enable unbiased learning from logged user interactions. One of the major difficulties in applying Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approaches to counterfactual learning problems is the large variance introduced by the propensity weights. In this paper we show that the convergence rate of SGD approaches with IPS-weighted gradients suffers from the large variance introduced by the IPS weights: convergence is slow, especially when there are large IPS weights."
DVGAN: A Minimax Game for Search Result Diversification Combining Explicit and Implicit Features,"Search result diversification aims to retrieve diverse results to cover as many subtopics related to the query as possible. Recent studies showed that supervised diversification models are able to outperform the heuristic approaches, by automatically learning a diversification function other than using manually designed score functions. The main challenge of training a diversification model is the lack of high-quality training samples. Due to the involvement of dependence between documents in the ranker, it is very hard for training algorithms to select effective positive and negative ranking lists to train a reliable ranking model, given a large number of candidate documents within which different documents are relevant to different subtopics. To tackle this problem, we propose a supervised diversification framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It consists of a generator and a discriminator interacting with each other in a minimax game. Specifically, the generator generates more confusing negative samples for the discriminator, and the discriminator sends back complementary ranking signals to the generator. Furthermore, we explicitly exploit subtopics in the generator, whereas focusing on modeling document similarity in the discriminator. Through such a minimax game, we are able to obtain better ranking models by combining ranking signals learned by the generator and the discriminator. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset show that the proposed method can significantly outperform existing diversification methods."
Policy-Aware Unbiased Learning to Rank for Top-k Rankings,"Counterfactual Learning to Rank (LTR) methods optimize ranking systems using logged user interactions that contain interaction biases. Existing methods are only unbiased if users are presented with all relevant items in every ranking. There is currently no existing counterfactual unbiased LTR method for top-k rankings. We introduce a novel policy-aware counterfactual estimator for LTR metrics that can account for the effect of a stochastic logging policy. We prove that the policy-aware estimator is unbiased if every relevant item has a non-zero probability to appear in the top-k ranking. Our experimental results show that the performance of our estimator is not affected by the size of k: for any k, the policy-aware estimator reaches the same retrieval performance while learning from top-k feedback as when learning from feedback on the full ranking. Lastly, we introduce novel extensions of traditional LTR methods to perform counterfactual LTR and to optimize top-k metrics. Together, our contributions introduce the first policy-aware unbiased LTR approach that learns from top-k feedback and optimizes top-k metrics. As a result, counterfactual LTR is now applicable to the very prevalent top-k ranking setting in search and recommendation."
SetRank: Learning a Permutation-Invariant Ranking Model for Information Retrieval,"In learning-to-rank for information retrieval, a ranking model is automatically learned from the data and then utilized to rank the sets of retrieved documents. Therefore, an ideal ranking model would be a mapping from a document set to a permutation on the set, and should satisfy two critical requirements: (1) it should have the ability to model cross-document interactions so as to capture local context information in a query; (2) it should be permutation-invariant, which means that any permutation of the inputted documents would not change the output ranking. Previous studies on learning-to-rank either design uni-variate scoring functions that score each document separately, and thus failed to model the cross-document interactions; or construct multivariate scoring functions that score documents sequentially, which inevitably sacrifice the permutation invariance requirement. In this paper, we propose a neural learning-to-rank model called SetRank which directly learns a permutation-invariant ranking model defined on document sets of any size. SetRank employs a stack of (induced) multi-head self attention blocks as its key component for learning the embeddings for all of the retrieved documents jointly. The self-attention mechanism not only helps SetRank to capture the local context information from cross-document interactions, but also to learn permutation-equivariant representations for the inputted documents, which therefore achieving a permutation-invariant ranking model. Experimental results on three benchmarks showed that the SetRank significantly outperformed the baselines include the traditional learning-to-rank models and state-of-the-art Neural IR models."
Reinforcement Learning to Rank with Pairwise Policy Gradient,"This paper concerns reinforcement learning~(RL) of the document ranking models for information retrieval~(IR). One branch of the RL approaches to ranking formalize the process of ranking with Markov decision process~(MDP) and determine the model parameters with policy gradient. Though preliminary success has been shown, these approaches are still far from achieving their full potentials. Existing policy gradient methods directly utilize the absolute performance scores (returns) of the sampled document lists in its gradient estimations, which may cause two limitations: 1) fail to reflect the relative goodness of documents within the same query, which usually is close to the nature of IR ranking; 2) generate high variance gradient estimations, resulting in slow learning speed and low ranking accuracy. To deal with the issues, we propose a novel policy gradient algorithm in which the gradients are determined using pairwise comparisons of two document lists sampled within the same query. The algorithm, referred to as Pairwise Policy Gradient (PPG), repeatedly samples pairs of document lists, estimates the gradients with pairwise comparisons, and finally updates the model parameters. Theoretical analysis shows that PPG makes an unbiased and low variance gradient estimations. Experimental results have demonstrated performance gains over the state-of-the-art baselines in search result diversification and text retrieval."

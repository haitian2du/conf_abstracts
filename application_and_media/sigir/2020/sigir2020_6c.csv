Modeling Personalized Item Frequency Information for Next-basket Recommendation,"Next-basket recommendation (NBR) is prevalent in e-commerce and retail industry. In this scenario, a user purchases a set of items (a basket) at a time. NBR performs sequential modeling and recommendation based on a sequence of baskets. NBR is in general more complex than the widely studied sequential (session-based) recommendation which recommends the next item based on a sequence of items. Recurrent neural network (RNN) has proved to be very effective for sequential modeling, and thus been adapted for NBR. However, we argue that existing RNNs cannot directly capture item frequency information in the recommendation scenario."
Transfer Learning via Contextual Invariants for One-to-Many Cross-Domain Recommendation,"The rapid proliferation of new users and items on the social web has aggravated the gray-sheep user/long-tail item challenge in recommender systems. Historically, cross-domain co-clustering methods have successfully leveraged shared users and items across dense and sparse domains to improve inference quality. However, they rely on shared rating data and cannot scale to multiple sparse target domains (i.e., the one-to-many transfer setting). This, combined with the increasing adoption of neural recommender architectures, motivates us to develop scalable neural layer-transfer approaches for cross-domain learning. Our key intuition is to guide neural collaborative filtering with domain-invariant components shared across the dense and sparse domains, improving the user and item representations learned in the sparse domains. We leverage contextual invariances across domains to develop these shared modules, and demonstrate that with user-item interaction context, we can learn-to-learn informative representation spaces even with sparse interaction data. We show the effectiveness and scalability of our approach on two public datasets and a massive transaction dataset from Visa, a global payments technology company (19% Item Recall, 3x faster vs. training separate models for each domain). Our approach is applicable to both implicit and explicit feedback settings."
Incorporating User Micro-behaviors and Item Knowledge into Multi-task Learning for Session-based Recommendation,"Session-based recommendation (SR) has become an important and popular component of various e-commerce platforms, which aims to predict the next interacted item based on a given session. Most of existing SR models only focus on exploiting the consecutive items in a session interacted by a certain user, to capture the transition pattern among the items. Although some of them have been proven effective, the following two insights are often neglected. First, a user's micro-behaviors, such as the manner in which the user locates an item, the activities that the user commits on an item (e.g., reading comments, adding to cart), offer fine-grained and deep understanding of the user's preference. Second, the item attributes, also known as item knowledge, provide side information to model the transition pattern among interacted items and alleviate the data sparsity problem. These insights motivate us to propose a novel SR model MKM-SR in this paper, which incorporates user Micro-behaviors and item Knowledge into Multi-task learning for Session-based Recommendation. Specifically, a given session is modeled on micro-behavior level in MKM-SR, i.e., with a sequence of item-operation pairs rather than a sequence of items, to capture the transition pattern in the session sufficiently. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task learning paradigm to involve learning knowledge embeddings which plays a role as an auxiliary task to promote the major task of SR. It enables our model to obtain better session representations, resulting in more precise SR recommendation results. The extensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate MKM-SR's superiority over the state-of-the-art SR models, justifying the strategy of incorporating knowledge learning."
Next-item Recommendation with Sequential Hypergraphs,"There is an increasing attention on next-item recommendation systems to infer the dynamic user preferences with sequential user interactions. While the semantics of an item can change over time and across users, the item correlations defined by user interactions in the short term can be distilled to capture such change, and help in uncovering the dynamic user preferences. Thus, we are motivated to develop a novel next-item recommendation framework empowered by sequential hypergraphs. Specifically, the framework: (i) adopts hypergraph to represent the short-term item correlations and applies multiple convolutional layers to capture multi-order connections in the hypergraph; (ii) models the connections between different time periods with a residual gating layer; and (iii) is equipped with a fusion layer to incorporate both the dynamic item embedding and short-term user intent to the representation of each interaction before feeding it into the self-attention layer for dynamic user modeling. Through experiments on datasets from the ecommerce sites Amazon and Etsy and the information sharing platform Goodreads, the proposed model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in predicting the next interesting item for each user."
Encoding History with Context-aware Representation Learning for Personalized Search,"The key to personalized search is to clarify the meaning of current query based on user's search history. Previous personalized studies tried to build user profiles on the basis of historical data to tailor the ranking. However, we argue that the user profile based methods do not really disambiguate the current query. They still retain some semantic bias when building user profiles. In this paper, we propose to encode history with context-aware representation learning to enhance the representation of current query, which is a direct way to clarify the user's information need. Specifically, endowed with the benefit from transformer on aggregating contextual information, we devise a query disambiguation model to parse the meaning of current query in multiple stages. Moreover, for covering the cases that current query is not sufficient to express the intent, we train a personalized language model to predict user intent from existing queries. Under the interaction of two sub-models, we can generate the context-aware representation of current query and re-rank the results based on it. Experimental results show the significant improvement of our model compared with previous methods."
Recommendation for New Users and New Items via Randomized Training and Mixture-of-Experts Transformation,"The cold start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. That is, how to recommend for new users and new items without any historical interaction record? Recent ML-based approaches have made promising strides versus traditional methods. These ML approaches typically combine both user-item interaction data of existing warm start users and items (as in CF-based methods) with auxiliary information of users and items such as user profiles and item content information (as in content-based methods). However, such approaches face key drawbacks including the error superimposition issue that the auxiliary-to-CF transformation error increases the final recommendation error; the ineffective learning issue that long distance from transformation functions to model output layer leads to ineffective model learning; and the unified transformation issue that applying the same transformation function for different users and items results in poor transformation."

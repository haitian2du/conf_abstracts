A General Knowledge Distillation Framework for Counterfactual Recommendation via Uniform Data,"Recommender systems are feedback loop systems, which often face bias problems such as popularity bias, previous model bias and position bias. In this paper, we focus on solving the bias problems in a recommender system via a uniform data. Through empirical studies in online and offline settings, we observe that simple modeling with a uniform data can alleviate the bias problems and improve the performance. However, the uniform data is always few and expensive to collect in a real product. In order to use the valuable uniform data more effectively, we propose a general knowledge distillation framework for counterfactual recommendation that enables uniform data modeling through four approaches: (1) label-based distillation focuses on using the imputed labels as a carrier to provide useful de-biasing guidance; (2) feature-based distillation aims to filter out the representative causal and stable features; (3) sample-based distillation considers mutual learning and alignment of the information of the uniform and non-uniform data; and (4) model structure-based distillation constrains the training of the models from the perspective of embedded representation. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and product datasets, demonstrating that the proposed four methods achieve better performance over the baseline models in terms of AUC and NLL. Moreover, we discuss the relation between the proposed methods and the previous works. We emphasize that counterfactual modeling with uniform data is a rich research area, and list some interesting and promising research topics worthy of further exploration.

Agreement and Disagreement between True and False-Positive Metrics in Recommender Systems Evaluation,"False-positive metrics can capture an important side of recommendation quality, focusing on the impact of suggestions that are disliked by users, as a complement of common metrics that only measure the amount of successful recommendations. In this paper we research the extent to which false-positive metrics agree or disagree with true-positive metrics in the offline evaluation of recommender systems. We discover a surprising degree of systematic disagreement that was occasionally noted but not explained in the literature by previous authors. We find an explanation for the discrepancy be-tween the metrics in the effect of popularity biases, which impact false and true-positive metrics in very different ways: instead of rewarding the recommendation of popular items, as with true-positive, false-positive metrics penalize the popular. We determine precise conditions and cases in the general trends, with a formal explanation for our findings, which we confirm and illustrate empirically in experiments with different datasets."
Leveraging Social Media for Medical Text Simplification,"Patients are increasingly using the web for understanding medical information, making health decisions, and validating physicians' advice. However, most of this content is tailored to an expert audience, due to which people with inadequate health literacy often find it difficult to access, comprehend, and act upon this information. Medical text simplification aims to alleviate this problem by computationally simplifying medical text. Most text simplification methods employ neural seq-to-seq models for this task. However, training such models requires a corpus of aligned complex and simple sentences. Creating such a dataset manually is effort intensive, while creating it automatically is prone to alignment errors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a denoising autoencoder based neural model for this task which leverages the simplistic writing style of medical social media text. Experiments on four datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the best known medical text simplification models across multiple automated and human evaluation metrics. Our model achieves an improvement of up to 16.52% over the existing best performing model on SARI which is the primary metric to evaluate text simplification models."
Sampler Design for Implicit Feedback Data by Noisy-label Robust Learning,"Implicit feedback data is extensively explored in recommendation as it is easy to collect and generally applicable. However, predicting users' preference on implicit feedback data is a challenging task since we can only observe positive (voted) samples and unvoted samples. It is difficult to distinguish between the negative samples and unlabeled positive samples from the unvoted ones. Existing works, such as Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), sample unvoted items as negative samples uniformly, therefore suffer from a critical noisy-label issue. To address this gap, we design an adaptive sampler based on noisy-label robust learning for implicit feedback data."
MaHRL: Multi-goals Abstraction Based Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Recommendations,"As huge commercial value of the recommender system, there has been growing interest to improve its performance in recent years. The majority of existing methods have achieved great improvement on the metric of click, but perform poorly on the metric of conversion possibly due to its extremely sparse feedback signal. To track this challenge, we design a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning based recommendation framework to model consumers' hierarchical purchase interest. Specifically, the high-level agent catches long-term sparse conversion interest, and automatically sets abstract goals for low-level agent, while the low-level agent follows the abstract goals and catches short-term click interest via interacting with real-time environment. To solve the inherent problem in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel multi-goals abstraction based deep hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm (MaHRL). Our proposed algorithm contains three contributions: 1) the high-level agent generates multiple goals to guide the low-level agent in different sub-periods, which reduces the difficulty of approaching high-level goals; 2) different goals share the same state encoder structure and its parameters, which increases the update frequency of the high-level agent and thus accelerates the convergence of our proposed algorithm; 3) an appreciated reward assignment mechanism is designed to allocate rewards in each goal so as to coordinate different goals in a consistent direction. We evaluate our proposed algorithm based on a real-world e-commerce dataset and validate its effectiveness."
Towards Question-based Recommender Systems,"Conversational and question-based recommender systems have gained increasing attention in recent years, with users enabled to converse with the system and better control recommendations. Nevertheless, research in the field is still limited, compared to traditional recommender systems. In this work, we propose a novel Question-based recommendation method, Qrec, to assist users to find items interactively, by answering automatically constructed and algorithmically chosen questions. Previous conversational recommender systems ask users to express their preferences over items or item facets. Our model, instead, asks users to express their preferences over descriptive item features. The model is first trained offline by a novel matrix factorization algorithm, and then iteratively updates the user and item latent factors online by a closed-form solution based on the user answers. Meanwhile, our model infers the underlying user belief and preferences over items to learn an optimal question-asking strategy by using Generalized Binary Search, so as to ask a sequence of questions to the user. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed matrix factorization model outperforms the traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model. Further, our proposed Qrec model can greatly improve the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, and it is also effective in the case of cold-start user and item recommendations."

Ranking-Incentivized Quality Preserving Content Modification,"The Web is a canonical example of a competitive retrieval setting where many documents' authors consistently modify their documents to promote them in rankings. We present an automatic method for quality-preserving modification of document content --- i.e., maintaining content quality --- so that the document is ranked higher for a query by a non-disclosed ranking function whose rankings can be observed. The method replaces a passage in the document with some other passage. To select the two passages, we use a learning-to-rank approach with a bi-objective optimization criterion: rank promotion and content-quality maintenance. We used the approach as a bot in content-based ranking competitions. Analysis of the competitions demonstrates the merits of our approach with respect to human content modifications in terms of rank promotion, content-quality maintenance and relevance."
On Understanding Data Worker Interaction Behaviors,"Understanding how data workers interact with data and various pieces of information (e.g., code snippet examples) is key to design systems that can better support them in exploring a given dataset. To date, however, there is a paucity of research studying information seeking patterns and the strategies adopted by data workers as they carry out data curation activities. In this work, we aim at understanding the behaviors of data workers in discovering data quality issues, and how these behavioral observations relate to their performance. Specifically, we investigate how data workers use information resources and tools to support their task completion. To this end, we collect a multi-modal dataset through a data-driven experiment that relies on the use of eye-tracking technology with a purpose-designed platform built on top of iPython Notebook. The collected data reveals that: (i) searching in external resources is a prevalent action that can be leveraged to achieve better performance; (ii) 'copy-paste-modify' is a typical strategy for writing code to complete tasks; (iii) providing sample code within the system could help data workers to get started with their task; and (iv) surfacing underlying data is an effective way to support exploration. By investigating the behaviors prior to each search action, we also find that the most common reasons that trigger external search actions are the need to seek assistance in writing or debugging code and to search for relevant code to reuse. Our findings provide insights into patterns of interactions with various system components and information resources to perform data curation tasks. This bears implications on the design of domain-specific IR systems for data workers like code-base search."
Creating a Children-Friendly Reading Environment via Joint Learning of Content and Human Attention,"Technological advancements have led to increasing availability of erotic literature and pornography novels online, which can be alluring to adolescence and children. Unfortunately, because of the inherent complexity of these indecent contents and training data sparseness, it is a challenging task to detect these readings in the Cyberspace while children can easily access them. In this study, we propose a novel framework, Joint Learning of Content and Human Attention (GoodMan), to identify indecent readings by augmenting natural language understanding models with large scale human reading behaviors (dwell time per page) on portable devices. From the text modeling viewpoint, the innovative joint attention trained by joint learning is employed to orchestrate the content attention and human behavior attention via the BiGRU. From the data augmentation perspective, various users' reading behaviors on the same text can generate considerable training instances with joint attention, which can be effective to address the cold start problem. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on an online ebook dataset (with human reading behaviors on portable devices). The experimental results show insights into the task and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against alternative solutions."
Octopus: Comprehensive and Elastic User Representation for the Generation of Recommendation Candidates,"Candidate generation is a critical task for recommendation system, which is technically challenging from two perspectives. On the one hand, recommendation system requires the comprehensive inclusion of user's interested candidates, yet typical deep user modeling approaches would represent each user as an onefold vector, which is hard to capture user's diverse interests. On the other hand, for the sake of practicability, the candidate generation process needs to be both accurate and efficient. Although existing ""multi-channel structures'', like memory networks, are more capable of representing user's diverse interests, they may bring in substantial irrelevant candidates and lead to rapid growth of temporal cost. As a result, it remains a tough issue to comprehensively acquire user's interested items in a practical way."
The Cortical Activity of Graded Relevance,"Relevance is an essential concept in Information Retrieval (IR). Recent studies using brain imaging have significantly contributed towards the understanding of this concept, but only as a binary notion, i.e. a document being judged as relevant or non-relevant. While such a binary division is prevalent in IR, seminal theories have proposed relevance as a graded variable; i.e. having different degrees. In this paper, we aim to investigate the brain activity associated with relevance when it is treated as a graded concept. Twenty-five participants provided graded relevance judgements in the context of a Question Answering (Q/A) Task, during assessment with an electroencephalogram (EEG). Our findings show that significant differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) were observed in response to information segments processed in the context of high-relevance, low-relevance and no-relevance, supporting the concept of graded relevance. We speculate that differences in attentional engagement, semantic mismatch (between the question and answer) and memory processing underpin the electrophysiological responses to the graded relevance judgements. We believe our conclusions constitute an important step in unravelling the nature of graded relevance and knowledge of the electrophysiological modulation to each grade of relevance will help to improve the design and evaluation of IR systems."
Asymmetric Tri-training for Debiasing Missing-Not-At-Random Explicit Feedback,"In most real-world recommender systems, the observed rating data are subject to selection bias, and the data are thus missing-not-at-random. Developing a method to facilitate the learning of a recommender with biased feedback is one of the most challenging problems, as it is widely known that naive approaches under selection bias often lead to suboptimal results. A well-established solution for the problem is using propensity scoring techniques. The propensity score is the probability of each data being observed, and unbiased performance estimation is possible by weighting each data by the inverse of its propensity. However, the performance of the propensity-based unbiased estimation approach is often affected by choice of the propensity estimation model or the high variance problem. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic meta-learning method inspired by the asymmetric tri-training framework for unsupervised domain adaptation. The proposed method utilizes two predictors to generate data with reliable pseudo-ratings and another predictor to make the final predictions. In a theoretical analysis, a propensity-independent upper bound of the true performance metric is derived, and it is demonstrated that the proposed method can minimize this bound. We conduct comprehensive experiments using public real-world datasets. The results suggest that the previous propensity-based methods are largely affected by the choice of propensity models and the variance problem caused by the inverse propensity weighting. Moreover, we show that the proposed meta-learning method is robust to these issues and can facilitate in developing effective recommendations from biased explicit feedback."
Beyond User Embedding Matrix: Learning to Hash for Modeling Large-Scale Users in Recommendation,"Modeling large scale and rare-interaction users are the two major challenges in recommender systems, which derives big gaps between researches and applications. Facing to millions or even billions of users, it is hard to store and leverage personalized preferences with a user embedding matrix in real scenarios. And many researches pay attention to users with rich histories, while users with only one or several interactions are the biggest part in real systems. Previous studies make efforts to handle one of the above issues but rarely tackle efficiency and cold-start problems together."

Fashion Compatibility Modeling through a Multi-modal Try-on-guided Scheme,"Recent years have witnessed a growing trend of fashion compatibility modeling, which scores the matching degree of the given outfit and then provides people with some dressing advice. Existing methods have primarily solved this problem by analyzing the discrete interaction among multiple complementary items. However, the fashion items would present certain occlusion and deformation when they are worn on the body. Therefore, the discrete item interaction cannot capture the fashion compatibility in a combined manner due to the neglect of a crucial factor: the overall try-on appearance. In light of this, we propose a multi-modal try-on-guided compatibility modeling scheme to jointly characterize the discrete interaction and try-on appearance of the outfit. In particular, we first propose a multi-modal try-on template generator to automatically generate a try-on template from the visual and textual information of the outfit, depicting the overall look of its composing fashion items. Then, we introduce a new compatibility modeling scheme which integrates the outfit try-on appearance into the traditional discrete item interaction modeling. To fulfill the proposal, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset from SSENSE, named FOTOS, consisting of 11,000 well-matched outfits and their corresponding realistic try-on images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated its superiority to state-of-the-arts."
Spatial Object Recommendation with Hints: When Spatial Granularity Matters,"Existing spatial object recommendation algorithms generally treat objects identically when ranking them. However, spatial objects often cover different levels of spatial granularity and thereby are heterogeneous. For example, one user may prefer to be recommended a region (say Manhattan), while another user might prefer a venue (say a restaurant). Even for the same user, preferences can change at different stages of data exploration. In this paper, we study how to support top-k spatial object recommendations at varying levels of spatial granularity, enabling spatial objects at varying granularity, such as a city, suburb, or building, as a Point of Interest (POI). To solve this problem, we propose the use of a POI tree, which captures spatial containment relationships between POIs. We design a novel multi-task learning model called MPR (short for Multi-level POI Recommendation), where each task aims to return the top-k POIs at a certain spatial granularity level. Each task consists of two subtasks: (i) attribute-based representation learning; (ii) interaction-based representation learning. The first subtask learns the feature representations for both users and POIs, capturing attributes directly from their profiles. The second subtask incorporates user-POI interactions into the model. Additionally, MPR can provide insights into why certain recommendations are being made to a user based on three types of hints: user-aspect, POI-aspect, and interaction-aspect. We empirically validate our approach using two real-life datasets, and show promising performance improvements over several state-of-the-art methods."
Product Bundle Identification using Semi-Supervised Learning,"Many sellers on e-commerce platforms offer buyers product bundles, which package together two or more different items. The identification of such bundles is a necessary step to support a variety of related services, from recommendation to dynamic pricing. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of bundle identification on a large e-commerce website. Our analysis of bundle compared to non-bundle listed items reveals several key differentiating characteristics, spanning the listing's title, image, and attributes. Following, we experiment with a multi-modal classifier, which takes advantage of these characteristics as features. Our analysis also shows that a bundle indicator input by sellers tends to be highly noisy and carries only a weak signal. The bundle identification task therefore faces the challenge of having a small set of manually-labeled clean examples and a larger set of noisy-labeled examples, in conjunction with class imbalance due to the relative scarcity of bundles."
Coding Electronic Health Records with Adversarial Reinforcement Path Generation,"Electronic Health Record (EHR) coding is the task of assigning one or more International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to every EHR. Most previous work either ignores the hierarchical nature of the ICD codes or only focuses on parent-child relations. Moreover, existing EHR coding methods predict ICD codes from the leaf level with the greatest ICD number and the most fine-grained categories, which makes it difficult for models to make correct decisions. In order to address these problems, we model EHR coding as a path generation task. For this approach, we need to address two main challenges: (1) How to model relations between EHR and ICD codes, and relations between ICD codes? (2) How to evaluate the quality of generated ICD paths in order to obtain a signal that can be used to supervise the learning? We propose a coarse-to-fine ICD path generation framework, named Reinforcement Path Generation Network (RPGNet), that implements EHR coding with a Path Generator (PG) and a Path Discriminator (PD). We address challenge (1) by introducing a Path Message Passing (PMP) module in the PG to encode three types of relation: between EHRs and ICD codes, between parent-child ICD codes, and between sibling ICD codes. To address challgenge (2), we propose a PD component that estimates the reward for each ICD code in a generated path. RPGNet is trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL) in an adversarial manner. Experiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that RPGNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of micro-averaged F1 and micro-averaged AUC."
Degree-Aware Alignment for Entities in Tail,"Entity alignment (EA) is to discover equivalent entities in knowledge graphs (KGs), which bridges heterogeneous sources of information and facilitates the integration of knowledge. Existing EA solutions mainly rely on structural information to align entities, typically through KG embedding. Nonetheless, in real-life KGs, only a few entities are densely connected to others, and the rest majority possess rather sparse neighborhood structure. We refer to the latter as long-tail entities, and observe that such phenomenon arguably limits the use of structural information for EA."
Regional Relation Modeling for Visual Place Recognition,"In the process of visual perception, humans perceive not only the appearance of objects existing in a place but also their relationships (e.g. spatial layout). However, the dominant works on visual place recognition are always based on the assumption that two images depict the same place if they contain enough similar objects, while the relation information is neglected. In this paper, we propose a regional relation module which models the regional relationships and converts the convolutional feature maps to the relational feature maps. We further design a cascaded pooling method to get discriminative relation descriptors by preventing the influence of confusing relations and preserving as much useful information as possible. Extensive experiments on two place recognition benchmarks demonstrate that training with the proposed regional relation module improves the appearance descriptors and the relation descriptors are complementary to appearance descriptors. When these two kinds of descriptors are concatenated together, the resulting combined descriptors outperform the state-of-the-art methods."

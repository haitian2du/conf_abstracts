Pairwise View Weighted Graph Network for View-based 3D Model Retrieval,"View-based 3D model retrieval has become an important task in both computer vision and machine learning domains. Although deep learning methods have achieved excellent performances on view-based 3D model retrieval, the intrinsic correlation and the degree of view discrimination among multiple views in a 3D model have not been effectively exploited. To obtain a more efficient feature descriptor for 3D model retrieval, in this work, we propose the pairwise view weighted graph network (abbreviated PVWGN) for view-based 3D model retrieval where non-local graph layers are embedded into the network architecture to automatically mine the intrinsic relationship among multiple views of a 3D model. Furthermore, the view weighted layer is employed in the PVWGN to adaptively assign the weight to each view according to its aggregation information. In addition, the pairwise discrimination loss function is designed to improve the feature discrimination of the 3D model. Most importantly, these three issues are integrated into a unified framework. Extensive experimental results on the ModelNet40 and ModelNet10 3D model retrieval datasets show that PVWGN can outperform all state-of-the-art methods on the 3D model retrieval task with mAPs of 93.2% and 96.2%, respectively."
Detecting User Community in Sparse Domain via Cross-Graph Pairwise Learning,"Cyberspace hosts abundant interactions between users and different kinds of objects, and their relations are often encapsulated as bipartite graphs. Detecting user community in such heterogeneous graphs is an essential task to uncover user information needs and to further enhance recommendation performance. While several main cyber domains carrying high-quality graphs, unfortunately, most others can be quite sparse. However, as users may appear in multiple domains (graphs), their high-quality activities in the main domains can supply community detection in the sparse ones, e.g., user behaviors on Google can help thousands of applications to locate his/her local community when s/he uses Google ID to login those applications. In this paper, our model, Pairwise Cross-graph Community Detection (PCCD), is proposed to cope with the sparse graph problem by involving external graph knowledge to learn user pairwise community closeness instead of detecting direct communities. Particularly in our model, to avoid taking excessive propagated information, a two-level filtering module is utilized to select the most informative connections through both community and node level filters. Subsequently, a Community Recurrent Unit (CRU) is designed to estimate pairwise user community closeness. Extensive experiments on two real-world graph datasets validate our model against several strong alternatives. Supplementary experiments also validate its robustness on graphs with varied sparsity scales."
BiANE: Bipartite Attributed Network Embedding,"Network embedding effectively transforms complex network data into a low-dimensional vector space and has shown great performance in many real-world scenarios, such as link prediction, node classification, and similarity search. A plethora of methods have been proposed to learn node representations and achieve encouraging results. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid on the embedding technique for bipartite attributed networks, which is a typical data structure for modeling nodes from two distinct partitions."
Hierarchical Fashion Graph Network for Personalized Outfit Recommendation,"Fashion outfit recommendation has attracted increasing attentions from online shopping services and fashion communities.Distinct from other scenarios (e.g., social networking or content sharing) which recommend a single item (e.g., a friend or picture) to a user, outfit recommendation predicts user preference on a set of well-matched fashion items. Hence, performing high-quality personalized outfit recommendation should satisfy two requirements -- 1) the nice compatibility of fashion items and 2) the consistence with user preference. However, present works focus mainly on one of the requirements and only consider either user-outfit or outfit-item relationships, thereby easily leading to suboptimal representations and limiting the performance."
Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks for Session-based Recommendation,"Session-based recommendation (SBR) is a challenging task, which aims at recommending items based on anonymous behavior sequences. Almost all the existing solutions for SBR model user preference only based on the current session without exploiting the other sessions, which may contain both relevant and irrelevant item-transitions to the current session. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GCE-GNN) to exploit item transitions over all sessions in a more subtle manner for better inferring the user preference of the current session. Specifically, GCE-GNN learns two levels of item embeddings from session graph and global graph, respectively: (i) Session graph, which is to learn the session-level item embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions within the current session; and (ii) Global graph, which is to learn the global-level item embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions over all sessions. In GCE-GNN, we propose a novel global-level item representation learning layer, which employs a session-aware attention mechanism to recursively incorporate the neighbors' embeddings of each node on the global graph. We also design a session-level item representation learning layer, which employs a GNN on the session graph to learn session-level item embeddings within the current session. Moreover, GCE-GNN aggregates the learnt item representations in the two levels with a soft attention mechanism. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCE-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently."
Interactive Recommender System via Knowledge Graph-enhanced Reinforcement Learning,"Interactive recommender system (IRS) has drawn huge attention because of its flexible recommendation strategy and the consideration of optimal long-term user experiences. To deal with the dynamic user preference and optimize accumulative utilities, researchers have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) into IRS. However, RL methods share a common issue of sample efficiency, i.e., huge amount of interaction data is required to train an effective recommendation policy, which is caused by the sparse user responses and the large action space consisting of a large number of candidate items. Moreover, it is infeasible to collect much data with explorative policies in online environments, which will probably harm user experience. In this work, we investigate the potential of leveraging knowledge graph (KG) in dealing with these issues of RL methods for IRS, which provides rich side information for recommendation decision making. Instead of learning RL policies from scratch, we make use of the prior knowledge of the item correlation learned from KG to (i) guide the candidate selection for better candidate item retrieval, (ii) enrich the representation of items and user states, and (iii) propagate user preferences among the correlated items over KG to deal with the sparsity of user feedback. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets, which demonstrate the superiority of our approach with significant improvements against state-of-the-arts."

Try This Instead: Personalized and Interpretable Substitute Recommendation,"As a fundamental yet significant process in personalized recommendation, candidate generation and suggestion effectively help users spot the most suitable items for them. Consequently, identifying substitutable items that are interchangeable opens up new opportunities to refine the quality of generated candidates. When a user is browsing a specific type of product (e.g., a laptop) to buy, the accurate recommendation of substitutes (e.g., better equipped laptops) can offer the user more suitable options to choose from, thus substantially increasing the chance of a successful purchase. However, existing methods merely treat this problem as mining pairwise item relationships without the consideration of users' personal preferences. Moreover, the substitutable relationships are implicitly identified through the learned latent representations of items, leading to uninterpretable recommendation results."
Towards Linking Camouflaged Descriptions to Implicit Products in E-commerce,"As the emergence of E-commerce services, billions of products are sold online everyday. How to detect illegal products from the large-scale online products has become an important and practical research problem. In order to evade detection, malicious sellers usually utilize camouflaged text to describe their illegal products implicitly. Thus brings great challenges to the current detection systems since newly camouflaged text can hardly be learned from historical data and the distribution of illegal and normal products is extremely unbalanced. Rather than solving this problem as a classification task in most previous efforts, we reformulate the problem from a perspective of implicit entity linking, which targets at linking a camouflaged description to a known product. In this paper, we introduce three types of context that could help to infer implicit entity from camouflaged descriptions and propose an end-to-end contextual representation model to capture the effect of different context. Furthermore, we involve a symmetric metric to model the matching score of the input title to the product by learning the mutual effect among the context. The experimental results on the datasets collected from a real-world E-commerce site demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model against the state-of-the-art methods."
Distributed Equivalent Substitution Training for Large-Scale Recommender Systems,"We present Distributed Equivalent Substitution (DES) training, a novel distributed training framework for large-scale recommender systems with dynamic sparse features. DES introduces fully synchronous training to large-scale recommendation system for the first time by reducing communication, thus making the training of commercial recommender systems converge faster and reach better CTR. DES requires much less communication by substituting the weights-rich operators with the computationally equivalent sub-operators and aggregating partial results instead of transmitting the huge sparse weights directly through the network. Due to the use of synchronous training on large-scale Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs), DES achieves higher AUC(Area Under ROC). We successfully apply DES training on multiple popular DLRMs of industrial scenarios. Experiments show that our implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art PS-based training framework, achieving up to 68.7% communication savings and higher throughput compared to other PS-based recommender systems."
Query Resolution for Conversational Search with Limited Supervision,"In this work we focus on multi-turn passage retrieval as a crucial component of conversational search. One of the key challenges in multi-turn passage retrieval comes from the fact that the current turn query is often underspecified due to zero anaphora, topic change, or topic return. Context from the conversational history can be used to arrive at a better expression of the current turn query, defined as the task of query resolution. In this paper, we model the query resolution task as a binary term classification problem: for each term appearing in the previous turns of the conversation decide whether to add it to the current turn query or not. We propose QuReTeC (Query Resolution by Term Classification), a neural query resolution model based on bidirectional transformers. We propose a distant supervision method to automatically generate training data by using query-passage relevance labels. Such labels are often readily available in a collection either as human annotations or inferred from user interactions. We show that QuReTeC outperforms state-of-the-art models, and furthermore, that our distant supervision method can be used to substantially reduce the amount of human-curated data required to train QuReTeC. We incorporate QuReTeC in a multi-turn, multi-stage passage retrieval architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness on the TREC CAsT dataset."
Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems,"In session-based or sequential recommendation, it is important to consider a number of factors like long-term user engagement, multiple types of user-item interactions such as clicks, purchases etc. The current state-of-the-art supervised approaches fail to model them appropriately. Casting sequential recommendation task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem is a promising direction. A major component of RL approaches is to train the agent through interactions with the environment. However, it is often problematic to train a recommender in an on-line fashion due to the requirement to expose users to irrelevant recommendations. As a result, learning the policy from logged implicit feedback is of vital importance, which is challenging due to the pure off-policy setting and lack of negative rewards (feedback)."
Generative Attribute Manipulation Scheme for Flexible Fashion Search,"In this work, we aim to investigate the practical task of flexible fashion search with attribute manipulation, where users can retrieve the target fashion items by replacing the unwanted attributes of an available query image with the desired ones (e.g., changing the collar attribute from v-neck to round). Although several pioneer efforts have been dedicated to fulfilling the task, they mainly ignore the potential of generative models in enhancing the visual understanding of target fashion items. To this end, we propose an end-to-end generative attribute manipulation scheme, which consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator works on producing the prototype image that meets the user's requirement of attribute manipulation over the query image with the regularization of visual-semantic consistency and pixel-wise consistency. Besides, the discriminator aims to jointly fulfill the semantic learning towards correct attribute manipulation and adversarial metric learning for fashion search. Pertaining to the adversarial metric learning, we provide two general paradigms: the pair-based scheme and the triplet-based scheme, where the fake generated prototype images that closely resemble the ground truth images of target items are incorporated as hard negative samples to boost the model performance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our scheme."

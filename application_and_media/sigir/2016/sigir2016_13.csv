R-Susceptibility: An IR-Centric Approach to Assessing Privacy Risks for Users in Online Communities,"Privacy of Internet users is at stake because they expose personal information in posts created in online communities, in search queries, and other activities. An adversary that monitors a community may identify the users with the most sensitive properties and utilize this knowledge against them (e.g., by adjusting the pricing of goods or targeting ads of sensitive nature). Existing privacy models for structured data are inadequate to capture privacy risks from user posts."
Scalable Semantic Matching of Queries to Ads in Sponsored Search Advertising,"Sponsored search represents a major source of revenue for web search engines. The advertising model brings a unique possibility for advertisers to target direct user intent communicated through a search query, usually done by displaying their ads alongside organic search results for queries deemed relevant to their products or services. However, due to a large number of unique queries, it is particularly challenging for advertisers to identify all relevant queries. For this reason search engines often provide a service of advanced matching, which automatically finds additional relevant queries for advertisers to bid on. We present a novel advance match approach based on the idea of semantic embeddings of queries and ads. The embeddings were learned using a large data set of user search sessions, consisting of search queries, clicked ads and search links, while utilizing contextual information such as dwell time and skipped ads. To address the large-scale nature of our problem, both in terms of data and vocabulary size, we propose a novel distributed algorithm for training of the embeddings. Finally, we present an approach for overcoming a cold-start problem associated with new ads and queries. We report results of editorial evaluation and online tests on actual search traffic. The results show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in terms of relevance, coverage and incremental revenue. Lastly, as part of this study, we open sourced query embeddings that can be used to advance the field."
Retrieving Non-Redundant Questions to Summarize a Product Review,"Product reviews have become an important resource for customers before they make purchase decisions. However, the abundance of reviews makes it difficult for customers to digest them and make informed choices. In our study, we aim to help customers who want to quickly capture the main idea of a lengthy product review before they read the details. In contrast with existing work on review analysis and document summarization, we aim to retrieve a set of real-world user questions to summarize a review. In this way, users would know what questions a given review can address and they may further read the review only if they have similar questions about the product. Specifically, we design a two-stage approach which consists of question retrieval and question diversification. We first propose probabilistic retrieval models to locate candidate questions that are relevant to a review. We then design a set function to re-rank the questions with the goal of rewarding diversity in the final question set. The set function satisfies submodularity and monotonicity, which results in an efficient greedy algorithm of submodular optimization. Evaluation on product reviews from two categories shows that the proposed approach is effective for discovering meaningful questions that are representative for individual reviews."

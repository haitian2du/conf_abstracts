Ask Your TV: Real-Time Question Answering with Recurrent Neural Networks,"Voice-based interfaces are very popular in today's world, and Comcast customers are no exception. Usage stats show that our new X1 TV platform receives millions of voice queries per day. As a result, expanding the coverage of our voice interface provides a critical competitive advantage, allowing customers to speak freely instead of having to stick to a rigid set of commands. The ultimate objective is to provide a more natural user experience and increase access to our knowledge graph (KG) and entertainment platform."
Amazon Search: The Joy of Ranking Products,"Amazon is one of the world's largest e-commerce sites and Amazon Search powers the majority of Amazon's sales. As a consequence, even small improvements in relevance ranking both positively influence the shopping experience of millions of customers and significantly impact revenue. In the past, Amazon's product search engine consisted of several hand-tuned ranking functions using a handful of input features. A lot has changed since then. In this talk we are going to cover a number of relevance algorithms used in Amazon Search today. We will describe a general machine learning framework used for ranking within categories, blending separate rankings in All Product Search, NLP techniques used for matching queries and products, and algorithms targeted at unique tasks of specific categories --- books and fashion."
Learning to Rank Personalized Search Results in Professional Networks,"LinkedIn search is deeply personalized - for the same queries, different searchers expect completely different results. This paper presents our approach to achieving this by mining various data sources available in LinkedIn to infer searchers' intents (such as hiring, job seeking, etc.), as well as extending the concept of homophily to capture the searcher-result similarities on many aspects. Then, learning-to-rank is applied to combine these signals with standard search features."

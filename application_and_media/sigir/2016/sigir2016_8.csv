Novelty based Ranking of Human Answers for Community Questions,"Questions and their corresponding answers within a community based question answering (CQA) site are frequently presented as top search results forWeb search queries and viewed by millions of searchers daily. The number of answers for CQA questions ranges from a handful to dozens, and a searcher would be typically interested in the different suggestions presented in various answers for a question. Yet, especially when many answers are provided, the viewer may not want to sift through all answers but to read only the top ones. Prior work on answer ranking in CQA considered the qualitative notion of each answer separately, mainly whether it should be marked as best answer. We propose to promote CQA answers not only by their relevance to the question but also by the diversification and novelty qualities they hold compared to other answers. Specifically, we aim at ranking answers by the amount of new aspects they introduce with respect to higher ranked answers (novelty), on top of their relevance estimation. This approach is common in Web search and information retrieval, yet it was not addressed within the CQA settings before, which is quite different from classic document retrieval. We propose a novel answer ranking algorithm that borrows ideas from aspect ranking and multi-document summarization, but adapts them to our scenario. Answers are ranked in a greedy manner, taking into account their relevance to the question as well as their novelty compared to higher ranked answers and their coverage of important aspects. An experiment over a collection of Health questions, using a manually annotated gold-standard dataset, shows that considering novelty for answer ranking improves the quality of the ranked answer list."
That's Not My Question: Learning to Weight Unmatched Terms in CQA Vertical Search,"A fundamental task in Information Retrieval (IR) is term weighting. Early IR theory considered both the presence or absence of all terms in the lexicon for ranking and needed to weight them all. Yet, as the size of lexicons grew and models became too complex, common weighting models preferred to aggregate only the weights of the query terms that are matched in candidate documents. Thus, unmatched term contribution in these models is only considered indirectly, such as in probability smoothing with corpus distribution, or in weight normalization by document length. In this work we propose a novel term weighting model that directly assesses the weights of unmatched terms, and show its benefits. Specifically, we propose a Learning To Rank framework, in which features corresponding to matched terms are also ""mirrored"" in similar features that account only for unmatched terms. The relative importance of each feature is learned via a click-through query log. As a test case, we consider vertical search in Community-based Question Answering(CQA) sites from Web queries. Queries that result in viewing CQA content often contain fine grained information needs and benefit more from unmatched term weighting. We assess our model both via manual evaluation and via automatic evaluation over a clickthrough log. Our results show consistent improvement in retrieval when unmatched information is taken into account. This holds both when only identical terms are considered matched, and when related terms are matched via distributional similarity."
When a Knowledge Base Is Not Enough: Question Answering over Knowledge Bases with External Text Data,"One of the major challenges for automated question answering over Knowledge Bases (KBQA) is translating a natural language question to the Knowledge Base (KB) entities and predicates. Previous systems have used a limited amount of training data to learn a lexicon that is later used for question answering. This approach does not make use of other potentially relevant text data, outside the KB, which could supplement the available information. We introduce a new system, Text2KB, that enriches question answering over a knowledge base by using external text data. Specifically, we revisit different phases in the KBQA process and demonstrate that text resources improve question interpretation, candidate generation and ranking. Building on a state-of-the-art traditional KBQA system, Text2KB utilizes web search results, community question answering and general text document collection data, to detect question topic entities, map question phrases to KB predicates, and to enrich the features of the candidates derived from the KB. Text2KB significantly improves performance over the baseline KBQA method, as measured on a popular WebQuestions dataset. The results and insights developed in this work can guide future efforts on combining textual and structured KB data for question answering."

Explainable User Clustering in Short Text Streams,"User clustering has been studied from different angles: behavior-based, to identify similar browsing or search patterns, and content-based, to identify shared interests. Once user clusters have been found, they can be used for recommendation and personalization. So far, content-based user clustering has mostly focused on static sets of relatively long documents. Given the dynamic nature of social media, there is a need to dynamically cluster users in the context of short text streams. User clustering in this setting is more challenging than in the case of long documents as it is difficult to capture the users' dynamic topic distributions in sparse data settings. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic user clustering topic model (or UCT for short). UCT adaptively tracks changes of each user's time-varying topic distribution based both on the short texts the user posts during a given time period and on the previously estimated distribution. To infer changes, we propose a Gibbs sampling algorithm where a set of word-pairs from each user is constructed for sampling. The clustering results are explainable and human-understandable, in contrast to many other clustering algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we work with a dataset consisting of users and tweets from each user. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed clustering model compared to state-of-the-art baselines."
Topic Modeling for Short Texts with Auxiliary Word Embeddings,"For many applications that require semantic understanding of short texts, inferring discriminative and coherent latent topics from short texts is a critical and fundamental task. Conventional topic models largely rely on word co-occurrences to derive topics from a collection of documents. However, due to the length of each document, short texts are much more sparse in terms of word co-occurrences. Data sparsity therefore becomes a bottleneck for conventional topic models to achieve good results on short texts. On the other hand, when a human being interprets a piece of short text, the understanding is not solely based on its content words, but also her background knowledge (e.g., semantically related words). The recent advances in word embedding offer effective learning of word semantic relations from a large corpus. Exploiting such auxiliary word embeddings to enrich topic modeling for short texts is the main focus of this paper. To this end, we propose a simple, fast, and effective topic model for short texts, named GPU-DMM. Based on the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model, GPU-DMM promotes the semantically related words under the same topic during the sampling process by using the generalized Polya urn (GPU) model. In this sense, the background knowledge about word semantic relatedness learned from millions of external documents can be easily exploited to improve topic modeling for short texts. Through extensive experiments on two real-world short text collections in two languages, we show that GPU-DMM achieves comparable or better topic representations than state-of-the-art models, measured by topic coherence. The learned topic representation leads to the best accuracy in text classification task, which is used as an indirect evaluation."
Interleaved Evaluation for Retrospective Summarization and Prospective Notification on Document Streams,"We propose and validate a novel interleaved evaluation methodology for two complementary information seeking tasks on document streams: retrospective summarization and prospective notification. In the first, the user desires relevant and non-redundant documents that capture important aspects of an information need. In the second, the user wishes to receive timely, relevant, and non-redundant update notifications for a standing information need. Despite superficial similarities, interleaved evaluation methods for web ranking cannot be directly applied to these tasks; for example, existing techniques do not account for temporality or redundancy. Our proposed evaluation methodology consists of two components: a temporal interleaving strategy and a heuristic for credit assignment to handle redundancy. By simulating user interactions with interleaved results on submitted runs to the TREC 2014 tweet timeline generation (TTG) task and the TREC 2015 real-time filtering task, we demonstrate that our methodology yields system comparisons that accurately match the result of batch evaluations. Analysis further reveals weaknesses in current batch evaluation methodologies to suggest future directions for research."

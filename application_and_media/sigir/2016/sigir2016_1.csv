"Statistical Significance, Power, and Sample Sizes: A Systematic Review of SIGIR and TOIS, 2006-2015","We conducted a systematic review of 840 SIGIR full papers and 215 TOIS papers published between 2006 and 2015. The original objective of the study was to identify IR effectiveness experiments that are seriously underpowered (i.e., the sample size is far too small so that the probability of missing a real difference is extremely high) or overpowered (i.e., the sample size is so large that a difference will be considered statistically significant even if the actual effect size is extremely small). However, it quickly became clear to us that many IR effectiveness papers either lack significance testing or fail to report p-values and/or test statistics, which prevents us from conducting power analysis. Hence we first report on how IR researchers (fail to) report on significance test results, what types of tests they use, and how the reporting practices may have changed over the last decade. From those papers that reported enough information for us to conduct power analysis, we identify extremely overpowered and underpowered experiments, as well as appropriate sample sizes for future experiments. The raw results of our systematic survey of 1,055 papers and our R scripts for power analysis are available online. Our hope is that this study will help improve the reporting practices and experimental designs of future IR effectiveness studies."
Bayesian Performance Comparison of Text Classifiers,"How can we know whether one classifier is really better than the other? In the area of text classification, since the publication of Yang and Liu's seminal SIGIR-1999 paper, it has become a standard practice for researchers to apply null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) on their experimental results in order to establish the superiority of a classifier. However, such a frequentist approach has a number of inherent deficiencies and limitations, e.g., the inability to accept the null hypothesis (that the two classifiers perform equally well), the difficulty to compare commonly-used multivariate performance measures like F1 scores instead of accuracy, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach to the performance comparison of text classifiers, and argue its advantages over the traditional frequentist approach based on t-test etc. In contrast to the existing probabilistic model for F1 scores which is unpaired, our proposed model takes the correlation between classifiers into account and thus achieves greater statistical power. Using several typical text classification algorithms and a benchmark dataset, we demonstrate that the our approach provides rich information about the difference between two classifiers' performances."
A General Linear Mixed Models Approach to Study System Component Effects,"Topic variance has a greater effect on performances than system variance but it cannot be controlled by system developers who can only try to cope with it. On the other hand, system variance is important on its own, since it is what system developers may affect directly by changing system components and it determines the differences among systems. In this paper, we face the problem of studying system variance in order to better understand how much system components contribute to overall performances. To this end, we propose a methodology based on General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to develop statistical models able to isolate system variance, component effects as well as their interaction by relying on a Grid of Points (GoP) containing all the combinations of analysed components. We apply the proposed methodology to the analysis of TREC Ad-hoc data in order to show how it works and discuss some interesting outcomes of this new kind of analysis. Finally, we extend the analysis to different evaluation measures, showing how they impact on the sources of variance."

Principles for the Design of Online A/B Metrics,"In this paper, we describe principles for designing metrics in the context of A/B experiments. We share some issues that comes up in designing such experiments and provide solutions to avoid such pitfalls."
Visual Recommendation Use Case for an Online Marketplace Platform: allegro.pl,"In this paper we describe a small content-based visual recommendation project built as part of the Allegro online marketplace platform. We extracted relevant data only from images, as they are inherently better at capturing visual attributes than textual offer descriptions. We used several image descriptors to extract color and texture information in order to find visually similar items. We tested our results against available textual offer tags and also asked human users to subjectively assess the precision. Finally, we deployed the solution to our platform."
AOL's Named Entity Resolver: Solving Disambiguation via Document Strongly Connected Components and Ad-Hoc Edges Construction,"Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in unstructured text and linking them to their corresponding entries in a large knowledge base such as Freebase. Practically, each text match in a given document should be mapped to the correct entity out of the corresponding entities in the knowledge base or none of them if no correct entity is found (Empty Entry). The case of an empty entry makes the problem at hand more complex, but by solving it, one can successfully cope with missing and erroneous data as well as unknown entities. In this work we present AOL's Named Entity Resolver which was designed to handle real life scenarios including empty entries. As part of the automated news analysis platform, it processes over 500K news articles a day, entities from each article are extracted and disambiguated. According to our experiments, AOL's resolver shows much better results in disambiguating entities mapped to Wikipedia or Freebase compared to industry leading products."
The Data Stack in Information Retrieval,I propose to look at information retrieval applications from the perspective of the data stack infrastructure that is needed in research prototypes and production systems.

Leveraging User Interaction Signals for Web Image Search,"User interfaces for web image search engine results differ significantly from interfaces for traditional (text) web search results, supporting a richer interaction. In particular, users can see an enlarged image preview by hovering over a result image, and an `image preview' page allows users to browse further enlarged versions of the results, and to click-through to the referral page where the image is embedded. No existing work investigates the utility of these interactions as implicit relevance feedback for improving search ranking, beyond using clicks on images displayed in the search results page. In this paper we propose a number of implicit relevance feedback features based on these additional interactions: hover-through rate, 'converted-hover' rate, referral page click through, and a number of dwell time features. Also, since images are never self-contained, but always embedded in a referral page, we posit that clicks on other images that are embedded on the same referral webpage as a given image can carry useful relevance information about that image. We also posit that query-independent versions of implicit feedback features, while not expected to capture topical relevance, will carry feedback about the quality or attractiveness of images, an important dimension of relevance for web image search. In an extensive set of ranking experiments in a learning to rank framework, using a large annotated corpus, the proposed features give statistically significant gains of over 2% compared to a state of the art baseline that uses standard click features."
Self-Paced Cross-Modal Subspace Matching,"Cross-modal matching methods match data from different modalities according to their similarities. Most existing methods utilize label information to reduce the semantic gap between different modalities. However, it is usually time-consuming to manually label large-scale data. This paper proposes a Self-Paced Cross-Modal Subspace Matching (SCSM) method for unsupervised multimodal data. We assume that multimodal data are pair-wised and from several semantic groups, which form hard pair-wised constraints and soft semantic group constraints respectively. Then, we formulate the unsupervised cross-modal matching problem as a non-convex joint feature learning and data grouping problem. Self-paced learning, which learns samples from 'easy' to 'complex', is further introduced to refine the grouping result. Moreover, a multimodal graph is constructed to preserve the relationship of both inter- and intra-modality similarity. An alternating minimization method is employed to minimize the non-convex optimization problem, followed by the discussion on its convergence analysis and computational complexity. Experimental results on four multimodal databases show that SCSM outperforms state-of-the-art cross-modal subspace learning methods."
Composite Correlation Quantization for Efficient Multimodal Retrieval,"Efficient similarity retrieval from large-scale multimodal database is pervasive in modern search engines and social networks. To support queries across content modalities, the system should enable cross-modal correlation and computation-efficient indexing. While hashing methods have shown great potential in achieving this goal, current attempts generally fail to learn isomorphic hash codes in a seamless scheme, that is, they embed multiple modalities in a continuous isomorphic space and separately threshold embeddings into binary codes, which incurs substantial loss of retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we approach seamless multimodal hashing by proposing a novel Composite Correlation Quantization (CCQ) model. Specifically, CCQ jointly finds correlation-maximal mappings that transform different modalities into isomorphic latent space, and learns composite quantizers that convert the isomorphic latent features into compact binary codes. An optimization framework is devised to preserve both intra-modal similarity and inter-modal correlation through minimizing both reconstruction and quantization errors, which can be trained from both paired and partially paired data in linear time. A comprehensive set of experiments clearly show the superior effectiveness and efficiency of CCQ against the state of the art hashing methods for both unimodal and cross-modal retrieval."

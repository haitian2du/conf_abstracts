Challenge: RFID Hacking for Fun and Profit,"Passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are ubiquitous today due to their low cost (a few cents), relatively long communication range ($\sim$7-11~m), ease of deployment, lack of battery, and small form factor. Hence, they are an attractive foundation for environmental sensing. Although RFID-based sensors have been studied in the research literature and are also available commercially, manufacturing them has been a technically-challenging task that is typically undertaken only by experienced researchers. In this paper, we show how even hobbyists can transform commodity RFID tags into sensors by physically altering (`hacking') them using COTS sensors, a pair of scissors, and clear adhesive tape. Importantly, this requires no change to commercial RFID readers. We also propose a new legacy-compatible tag reading protocol called Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) that is robust to the changes in an RF environment. To validate our vision, we develop RFID-based sensors for illuminance, temperature, touch, and gestures. We believe that our approach has the potential to open up the field of batteryless backscatter-based RFID sensing to the research community, making it an exciting area for future work."
Parallel Backscatter in the Wild: When Burstiness and Randomness Play with You,"Parallel backscatter is a promising technique for high throughput, low power communications. The existing approaches of parallel backscatter are based on a common assumption, i.e. the states of the collided signals are distinguishable from each other in either the time domain or the IQ (the In-phase and Quadrature) domain. We in this paper disclose the superclustering phenomenon, which invalidates that assumption and seriously affects the decoding performance. Then we propose an interstellar travelling model to capture the bursty Gaussian process of a collided signal. Based on this model, we design Hubble, a reliable signal processing approach to support parallel backscatter in the wild. Hubble addresses several technical challenges: (i) a novel scheme based on Pearson's Chi-Square test to extract the collided signals' combined states, (ii) a Markov driven method to capture the law of signal state transitions, and (iii) error correction schemes to guarantee the reliability of parallel decoding. Theoretically, Hubble is able to decode all the backscattered data, as long as the signals are detectable by the receiver. The experiment results demonstrate that the median throughput of Hubble is $11.7\times$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art approach."
Experience: Cross-Technology Radio Respiratory Monitoring Performance Study,"This paper addresses the performance of systems which use commercial wireless devices to make bistatic RF channel measurements for non-contact respiration sensing. Published research has typically presented results from short controlled experiments on one system. In this paper, we deploy an extensive real-world comparative human subject study. We observe twenty patients during their overnight sleep (a total of 160 hours), during which contact sensors record ground-truth breathing data, patient position is recorded, and four different RF breathing monitoring systems simultaneously record measurements. We evaluate published methods and algorithms. We find that WiFi channel state information measurements provide the most robust respiratory rate estimates of the four RF systems tested. However, all four RF systems have periods during which RF-based breathing estimates are not reliable."
X-Tandem: Towards Multi-hop Backscatter Communication with Commodity WiFi,"Backscatter communication offers a cost- and energy-efficient means for IoT sensor data exchange. The IoT vision for ubiquitous interconnection, in practice, demands multi-hop connectivity for robust and scalable sensor networks, as well as compatibility with such prevailing wireless technologies as WiFi. Today's backscatter solutions however typically follow a single-hop paradigm, i.e., tags do not relay for each other. This paper presents X-Tandem, a multi-hop backscatter system that works with commodity WiFi devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that sensing tags can not only work as relays for each other but also modulate their sensing data into a single backscatter packet, which remains a legit WiFi packet that can be decoded with any commercial WiFi NICs. We discuss the design details of X-Tandem and have built a prototype with FPGAs and off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The prototype demonstrates a two-hop implementation, achieving a throughput up to 200 bps with tag-to-tag distances up to 0.4 m and communication ranges up to 8 m. Compared to single-hop solutions, X-Tandem can improve backscatter throughput by more than 10x in challenging indoor environments with obstacles."

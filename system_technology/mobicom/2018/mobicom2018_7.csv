Towards Environment Independent Device Free Human Activity Recognition,"Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, significant efforts have recently been made to explore device-free human activity recognition techniques that utilize the information collected by various wireless infrastructures to infer human activities without the need for the monitored subject to carry a dedicated device. Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework."
CrossSense: Towards Cross-Site and Large-Scale WiFi Sensing,"We present CrossSense, a novel system for scaling up WiFi sensing to new environments and larger problems. To reduce the cost of sensing model training data collection, CrossSense employs machine learning to train, off-line, a roaming model that generates from one set of measurements synthetic training samples for each target environment. To scale up to a larger problem size, CrossSense adopts a mixture-of-experts approach where multiple specialized sensing models, or experts, are used to capture the mapping from diverse WiFi inputs to the desired outputs. The experts are trained offline and at runtime the appropriate expert for a given input is automatically chosen. We evaluate CrossSense by applying it to two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and gesture recognition, in controlled single-link environments. We show that CrossSense boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art WiFi sensing techniques from 20% to over 80% and 90% for gait identification and gesture recognition respectively, delivering consistently good performance - particularly when the problem size is significantly greater than that current approaches can effectively handle."

EchoPrint: Two-factor Authentication using Acoustics and Vision on Smartphones,"User authentication on smartphones must satisfy both security and convenience, an inherently difficult balancing art. Apple's FaceID is arguably the latest of such efforts, at the cost of additional hardware (e.g., dot projector, flood illuminator and infrared camera). We propose a novel user authentication system EchoPrint, which leverages acoustics and vision for secure and convenient user authentication, without requiring any special hardware. EchoPrint actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to ""illuminate"" the user's face and authenticates the user by the unique features extracted from the echoes bouncing off the 3D facial contour. To combat changes in phone-holding poses thus echoes, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to extract reliable acoustic features, which are further combined with visual facial landmark locations to feed a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries, EchoPrint is not easily spoofed by images or videos like 2D visual face recognition systems. It needs only commodity hardware, thus avoiding the extra costs of special sensors in solutions like FaceID. Experiments with 62 volunteers and non-human objects such as images, photos, and sculptures show that EchoPrint achieves 93.75% balanced accuracy and 93.50% F-score, while the average precision is 98.05%, and no image/video based attack is observed to succeed in spoofing."
Ghostbuster: Detecting the Presence of Hidden Eavesdroppers,"This paper explores the possibility of detecting the hidden presence of wireless eavesdroppers. Such eavesdroppers employ passive receivers that only listen and never transmit any signals making them very hard to detect. In this paper, we show that even passive receivers leak RF signals on the wireless medium. This RF leakage, however, is extremely weak and buried under noise and other transmitted signals that can be 3-5 orders of magnitude larger. Hence, it is missed by today's radios. We design and build Ghostbuster, the first device that can reliably extract this leakage, even when it is buried under ongoing transmissions, in order to detect the hidden presence of eavesdroppers. Ghostbuster does not require any modifications to current transmitters and receivers and can accurately detect the eavesdropper in the presence of ongoing transmissions. Empirical results show that Ghostbuster can detect eavesdroppers with more than 95% accuracy up to 5 meters away."
"Body-Guided Communications: A Low-power, Highly-Confined Primitive to Track and Secure Every Touch","The growing number of devices we interact with require a convenient yet secure solution for user identification, authorization and authentication. Current approaches are cumbersome, susceptible to eavesdropping and relay attacks, or energy inefficient. In this paper, we propose a body-guided communication mechanism to secure every touch when users interact with a variety of devices and objects. The method is implemented in a hardware token worn on user's body, for example in the form of a wristband, which interacts with a receiver embedded inside the touched device through a body-guided channel established when the user touches the device. Experiments show low-power (uJ/bit) operation while achieving superior resilience to attacks, with the received signal at the intended receiver through the body channel being at least 20dB higher than that of an adversary in cm range."
CEIVE: Combating Caller ID Spoofing on 4G Mobile Phones Via Callee-Only Inference and Verification,"Caller ID spoofing forges the authentic caller identity, thus making the call appear to originate from another user. This seemingly simple attack technique has been used in the growing telephony frauds and scam calls, resulting in substantial monetary loss and victim complaints. Unfortunately, caller ID spoofing is easy to launch, yet hard to defend; no effective and practical defense solutions are in place to date. In this paper, we propose CEIVE (Callee-only inference and verification), an effective and practical defense against caller ID spoofing. It is a victim callee only solution without requiring additional infrastructure support or changes on telephony systems. We formulate the design as an inference and verification problem. Given an incoming call, CEIVE leverages a callback session and its associated call signaling observed at the phone to infer the call state of the other party. It further compares with the anticipated call state, thus quickly verifying whether the incoming call comes from the originating number. We exploit the standardized call signaling messages to extract useful features, and devise call-specific verification and learning to handle diversity and extensibility. We implement CEIVE on Android phones and test it with all top four US mobile carriers, one landline and two small carriers. It shows 100% accuracy in almost all tested spoofing scenarios except one special, targeted attack case."
Towards Replay-resilient RFID Authentication,"We provide the first solution to an important question, ""how a physical-layer authentication method can defend against signal replay attacks''. It was believed that if an attacker can replay the exact same reply signal of a legitimate authentication object (such as an RFID tag), any physical-layer authentication method will fail. This paper presents Hu-Fu, the first physical layer RFID authentication protocol that is resilient to the major attacks including tag counterfeiting, signal replay, signal compensation, and brute-force feature reply. Hu-Fu is built on two fundamental ideas, namely inductive coupling of two tags and signal randomization. Hu-Fu does not require any hardware or protocol modification on COTS passive tags and can be implemented with COTS devices. We implement a prototype of Hu-Fu and demonstrate that it is accurate and robust to device diversity and environmental changes, including locations, distance, and temperature. Hu-Fu provides a new direction of battery-free/low-power device authentication that enables numerous IoT applications."
Proximity-Proof: Secure and Usable Mobile Two-Factor Authentication,"Mobile two-factor authentication (2FA) has become commonplace along with the popularity of mobile devices. Current mobile 2FA solutions all require some form of user effort which may seriously affect the experience of mobile users, especially senior citizens or those with disability such as visually impaired users. In this paper, we propose Proximity-Proof, a secure and usable mobile 2FA system without involving user interactions. Proximity-Proof automatically transmits a user's 2FA response via inaudible OFDM-modulated acoustic signals to the login browser. We propose a novel technique to extract individual speaker and microphone fingerprints of a mobile device to defend against the powerful man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack. In addition, Proximity-Proof explores two-way acoustic ranging to thwart the co-located attack. To the best of our knowledge, Proximity-Proof is the first mobile 2FA scheme resilient to the MiM and co-located attacks. We empirically analyze that Proximity-Proof is at least as secure as existing mobile 2FA solutions while being highly usable. We also prototype Proximity-Proof and confirm its high security, usability, and efficiency through comprehensive user experiments."

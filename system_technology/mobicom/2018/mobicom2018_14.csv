ChromaCode: A Fully Imperceptible Screen-Camera Communication System,"Hidden screen-camera communication techniques emerge as a new paradigm that embeds data imperceptibly into regular videos while remaining unobtrusive to human viewers. Three key goals on imperceptible, high rate, and reliable communication are desirable but conflicting, and existing solutions usually made a trade-off among them. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of ChromaCode, a screen-camera communication system that achieves all three goals simultaneously. In our design, we consider for the first time color space for perceptually uniform lightness modifications. On this basis, we design an outcome-based adaptive embedding scheme, which adapts to both pixel lightness and regional texture. Last, we propose a concatenated code scheme for robust coding and devise multiple techniques to overcome various screen-camera channel errors. Our prototype and experiments demonstrate that ChromaCode achieves remarkable raw throughputs of >700 kbps, data goodputs of 120 kbps with BER of 0.05, and with fully imperceptible flicker for viewing proved by user study, which significantly outperforms previous works."
VSkin: Sensing Touch Gestures on Surfaces of Mobile Devices Using Acoustic Signals,"Enabling touch gesture sensing on all surfaces of the mobile device, not limited to the touchscreen area, leads to new user interaction experiences. In this paper, we propose VSkin, a system that supports fine-grained gesture-sensing on the back of mobile devices based on acoustic signals. VSkin utilizes both the structure-borne sounds, i.e., sounds propagating through the structure of the device, and the air-borne sounds, i.e., sounds propagating through the air, to sense finger tapping and movements. By measuring both the amplitude and the phase of each path of sound signals, VSkin detects tapping events with an accuracy of 99.65% and captures finger movements with an accuracy of 3.59mm."
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Power Network Electromagnetic Field,"Various sensing modalities have been exploited for indoor location sensing, each of which has well understood limitations, however. This paper presents a first systematic study on using the electromagnetic field (EMF) induced by a building's electric power network for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A basis of this work is a measurement study showing that the power network EMF sensed by either a customized sensor or smartphone's microphone as a side-channel sensor is spatially distinct and temporally stable. Based on this, we design a SLAM approach that can reliably detect loop closures based on EMF sensing results. With the EMF feature map constructed by SLAM, we also design an efficient online localization scheme for resource-constrained mobiles. Evaluation in three indoor spaces shows that the power network EMF is a promising modality for location sensing on mobile devices, which is able to run in real time and achieve sub-meter accuracy."
Cross-Frequency Communication: Near-Field Identification of UHF RFIDs with WiFi!,"Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have improved efficient cooperation among heterogeneous wireless devices. To date, however, even the most effective CTC systems require these devices to operate in the same ISM band (e.g., 2.4 GHz) because of the conventional wisdom that wireless transceivers with different (fundamental) frequencies cannot communicate with one another. Our work, which is called TiFi, challenges this belief by allowing a 2.4 GHz WiFi receiver (e.g., a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840 - 920 MHz. TiFi does not require changing current smartphones or tags. Instead, it leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement TiFi with commodity WiFi chipsets (e.g., Broadcom BCM43xx, Murata KM6D280 40, and Qualcomm WCN3990). Our comprehensive evaluation shows that TiFi allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of 2Â m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers."
Achieving Receiver-Side Cross-Technology Communication with Cross-Decoding,"Cross-technology Communication (CTC) is a key technique to explore the full capacity of heterogeneous wireless. The latest CTC designs explore the PHY-layer to reach the standards' maximum rate, but leaving a critical gap to practicality -- existing PHY-layer CTCs are commonly transmitter-side techniques requiring a high-end transmitter (with a high degree of freedom in signal manipulation) to emulate the receiver signal closely. This inherently limits the reverse direction (low-end to high-end) communication. We present XBee, a unique receiver-side CTC that fills in the gap and makes a critical step towards achieving CTC bidirectionality. XBee is demonstrated as a ZigBee to BLE communication, where the key innovation lies in the unique mechanism of cross-technology decoding, or cross-decoding in short, which interprets a ZigBee frame only by carefully observing the bit patterns obtained at the BLE receiver. Technically, XBee counterintuitively explores the sampling offset to overcome the intrinsic challenge due to BLE's narrower bandwidth (1MHz) than ZigBee (2MHz). Extensive implementation and evaluation on USRP and commodity devices reach 250 kbps under 85% reliability, a 15,000x improvement over state-of-the-art ZigBee to BLE communication, and comparable with the latest PHY-layer CTCs to achieve CTC bidirectionality."

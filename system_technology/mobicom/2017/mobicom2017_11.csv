RAVEN: Perception-aware Optimization of Power Consumption for Mobile Games,"High-end mobile GPUs are now becoming an integral part of mobile devices. However, a mobile GPU constitutes a major portion of power consumption on the devices, and mobile games top as the most popular class of graphics applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of RAVEN, a novel, on-the-fly frame rate scaling system for mobile gaming applications. RAVEN utilizes human visual perception of graphics change to opportunistically achieve power saving without degrading user experiences. The system develops a light-weight frame comparison technique to measure and predict perception-aware frame similarity. It also builds a low resolution virtual display which clones the device screen for performing similarity measurement at a low-power cost. It is able to work on an existing commercial smartphone and support applications from app stores without any modifications. It has been implemented on Nexus 5X, and its performance has been measured with 13 games. The system effectively reduces the overall power consumption of mobile devices while maintaining satisfactory user experiences. The power consumption is reduced by 21.78% on aver-age and up to 34.74%."
Advertising-based Measurement: A Platform of 7 Billion Mobile Devices,"The most important step in an empirical computer scientist's research is gathering sufficient real-world data to validate a system. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks: placing measurement tools in remote networks or end-clients requires one to marshal resources from different administrative domains, devices, populations, and countries. Often such efforts culminate in a trace that is deficient in multiple ways: a small set of test subjects, a short time frame, missing ground truth for device IDs, networking environments lacking in diversity and geographic spread, or highly biased sampling. We present a method of addressing these challenges by leveraging the most open and globally accessible test and measurement platform: digital advertising. Digital advertising instantly provides a window into 7 billion devices spanning every county for an extremely low cost. We propose Advertising as a Platform (AaaP), an ad-based system to perform massive-scale mobile measurement studies. In contrast with measurements made by large media companies who own platforms, ad networks, and apps, we concentrate on the opportunities and challenges for researchers that are end-users of advertising systems. We evaluate a prototype system, discuss ethical guidelines, and demonstrate its use in four scenarios: IP2Geo databases, bandwidth measurement, energy management, and the identifiability of mobile users. We show the efficacy and ease-of-use of AaaP, and illuminate key challenges and the great promise of using AaaP to study a wide variety of mobile phenomena."
NutShell: Scalable Whittled Proxy Execution for Low-Latency Web over Cellular Networks,"Despite much recent progress, Web page latencies over cellular networks remain much higher than those over wired networks. Proxies that execute Web page JavaScript (JS) and push objects needed by the client can reduce latency. However, a key concern is the scalability of the proxy which must execute JS for many concurrent users. In this paper, we propose to scale the proxies, focusing on a design where the proxy's execution is solely to push the needed objects and the client completely executes the page as normal. Such redundant execution is a simple, yet effective approach to cutting network latencies, which dominate page load delays in cellular settings. We develop whittling, a technique to identify and execute in the proxy only the JS code necessary to identify and push the objects required for the client page load, while skipping other code. Whittling is closely related to program slicing, but with the important distinction that it is acceptable to approximate the program slice in the proxy given the client's complete execution. Experiments with top Alexa Web pages show NutShell can sustain, on average, 27\% more user requests per second than a proxy performing fully redundant execution, while preserving, and sometimes enhancing, the latency benefits."

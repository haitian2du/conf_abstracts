WEBee: Physical-Layer Cross-Technology Communication via Emulation,"Recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) have improved efficient coexistence and cooperation among heterogeneous wireless devices (e.g., WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth) operating in the same ISM band. However, until now the effectiveness of existing CTCs, which rely on packet-level modulation, is limited due to their low throughput (e.g., tens of bps). Our work, named WEBee, opens a promising direction for high-throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. WEBee uses a high-speed wireless radio (e.g., WiFi OFDM) to emulate the desired signals of a low-speed radio (e.g., ZigBee). Our unique emulation technique manipulates only the payload of WiFi packets, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies -- a feature allowing zero-cost fast deployment on existing WiFi infrastructure. We designed and implemented WEBee with commodity devices (Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform (for PHY layer evaluation). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve a more than 99% reliable parallel CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with 126 Kbps in noisy environments, a throughput about 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTCs."
Stateful Inter-Packet Signal Processing for Wireless Networking,"Traditional signal processing design (e.g., frequency offset and channel estimation) at a receiver treats each packet arrival as an independent process to facilitate decoding and interpreting packet data. In this paper, we enhance the performance of this process in the wireless network domain. We propose STAteful inter-Packet signaL procEssing (STAPLE), a framework of stateful signal processing residing between the physical and link layers. STAPLE transforms the signal processing procedure into a lightweight stateful process that caches in a small-sized memory table physical and link layer header fields as packet state information. The similarity of such information among packets serves as prior knowledge to further enhance the reliability of signal processing and thus improve the wireless network performance. We implement STAPLE on USRP X300-series devices with adapted configurations for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac and 802.15.4. The STAPLE prototype is of low processing complexity and does not change any wireless standard specification. Comprehensive experimental results show that the benefit from STAPLE is universal in various wireless networks."
WiFi-Assisted 60 GHz Wireless Networks,"Despite years of innovative research and development, gigabit-speed 60 GHz wireless networks are still not mainstream. The main concern for network operators and vendors is the unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, which renders the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this paper, we design and implement MUST, an IEEE 802.11-compliant system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. Our experiments with off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware show that MUST can achieve 25-60% throughput gain over state-of-the-art solutions, while bringing almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement."
Pose Information Assisted 60 GHz Networks: Towards Seamless Coverage and Mobility Support,"60 GHz millimeter-wave networking has emerged as the next frontier technology to provide multi-Gbps wireless connectivity. However, the intrinsic directionality and limited field-of-view of 60 GHz antennas make the links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, seamless coverage, even at room level, becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose Pia, a robust 60 GHz network architecture that can provide seamless coverage and mobility support at multi-Gbps bitrate. Pia comprises multiple cooperating access points (APs). It leverages the pose information on mobile clients to proactively select the AP and manage multi-link spatial reuse. These decisions require a model of the pose/location of the APs and ambient reflectors. We address these challenges through a set of AP-pose sensing and compressive angle estimation algorithms that fuse the pose measurement with link quality measurement on the client. We have implemented Pia using commodity 60 GHz platforms. Our experiments show that Pia reduces the occurrence of link outage by 6.3x and improves the spatial sharing capacity by 76%, compared to conventional schemes that only use in-band information for adaptation."

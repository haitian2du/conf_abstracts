The darkLight rises: visible light communication in the dark,"Visible Light Communication (VLC) emerges as a new wireless communication technology with appealing benefits not present in radio communication. However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit shining light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed). It also entails high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC design and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios."
Making sense of mechanical vibration period with sub-millisecond accuracy using backscatter signals,"Traditional vibration inspection systems, equipped with separated sensing and communication modules, are either very expensive (e.g., hundreds of dollars) and/or suffer from occlusion and narrow field of view (e.g., laser). In this work, we present an RFID-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%. We also study three cases to demonstrate how to associate our inspection solution with the specific domain requirements."
Messages behind the sound: real-time hidden acoustic signal capture with smartphones,"With the ever-increasing use of smart devices, recent research endeavors have led to unobtrusive screen-camera communication channel designs, which allow simultaneous screen viewing and hidden screen-camera communication. Such practices, albeit innovative and effective, require well-controlled alignment of camera and screen and obstacle-free access."
Near-ultrasound communication for TV's 2nd screen services,"In this paper, we propose a near-ultrasound chirp signal-based communication for the TV's 2nd screen services. While near-ultrasound (with under 20 kHz frequency) communication has been developed for various applications recently, none of the previous work provides a perfect solution for 2nd screen services between TVs and smart devices. This is due mainly to the following real world challenges. The embedded signal in TV contents should be successfully received in a typical TV-watching environment by (i) delivering information at least at 15 bps with significantly low volume to avoid human perception, (ii) despite the presence of ambient noise, e.g., a tick, a snap, or a knock. To fulfill (i), we design chirp quaternary orthogonal keying (QOK) symbols. Especially, we aim to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects by symbol design in order to completely eliminate guard intervals. To resolve (ii), we propose the novel J-shape detection algorithms for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing. The proposed modem achieves almost zero frame error rate on a smartphone 2.7 m away from the TV even with minimal receive sound pressure level of 35 dBSPL, i.e., the noise level in a very quiet room. Moreover, throughout experiments and log analysis of 2nd screen service deployed in a nation-wide TV broadcasting system, J-shape detection algorithms are proven to achieve highly resilient performance for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing compared to previous schemes."

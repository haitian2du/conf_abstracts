Proteus: a network service control platform for service evolution in a mobile software defined infrastructure,"We present Proteus, a mobile network service control platform to enable safe and rapid evolution of services in a mobile software defined infrastructure (SDI). Proteus allows for network service and network component functionality to be specified in templates. These templates are used by the Proteus orchestrator to realize and modify service instances based on the specifics of a service creation request and the availability of resources in the mobile SDI and allows for service specific policies to be implemented. We evaluate our Proteus prototype in a realistic mobile networking testbed illustrating its ability to support service evolution."
Experience: accurate simulation of dense scenarios with hundreds of vehicular transmitters,"This paper reports on our methodology and experience from a multi-year effort to cross-validate a vehicular network experiment with four hundred Dedicated Short Range Communications IEEE 802.11p transmitters through ns-3 simulations. With most of these transmitters in communication range, this represents an extremely dense wireless configuration that challenges radio and interference models. Field test and simulations were conducted in tandem and iteratively to facilitate model selection and configuration as well as to allow a detailed evaluation of simulation accuracy. We have learned that 1) results were most sensitive to parameter choices in the propagation and receiver models, with simulator default parameters not providing a good match; 2) results could, however, be significantly improved by adapting, implementing, and calibrating the propagation models and receiver models from the literature, yielding 88% accuracy (in terms of packet error rate compared to the field test) in such a complex large-scale setting; 3) the process was helpful in identifying errors both in the simulation models and in the experimental code and points to opportunities for further research."
Tracking drone orientation with multiple GPS receivers,"Inertial sensors continuously track the 3D orientation of a flying drone, serving as the bedrock for maneuvers and stabilization. However, even the best inertial measurement units (IMU) are prone to various types of correlated failures. We consider using multiple GPS receivers on the drone as a fail-safe mechanism for IMU failures. The core challenge is in accurately computing the relative locations between each receiver pair, and translating these measurements into the drone's 3D orientation. Achieving IMU-like orientation requires the relative GPS distances to be accurate to a few centimeters -- a difficult task given that GPS today is only accurate to around 1-4 meters. Moreover, GPS-based orientation needs to be precise even under sharp drone maneuvers, GPS signal blockage, and sudden bouts of missing data. This paper designs SafetyNet, an off-the-shelf GPS-only system that addresses these challenges through a series of techniques, culminating in a novel particle filter framework running over multi-GNSS systems (GPS, GLONASS, and SBAS). Results from 11 sessions of 5-7 minute flights report median orientation accuracies of 2Â° even under overcast weather conditions. Of course, these improvements arise from an increase in cost due to the multiple GPS receivers, however, when safety is of interest, we believe that tradeoff is worthwhile."

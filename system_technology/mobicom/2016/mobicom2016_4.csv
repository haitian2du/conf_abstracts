A case for faster mobile web in cellular IPv6 networks,"The transition to IPv6 cellular networks creates uncertainty for content providers (CPs) and content delivery networks (CDNs) of whether and how to follow suit. Do CPs that update their CDN contracts to allow IPv6 hosting achieve better, or worse performance in mobile networks? Should CDNs continue to host mobile content over IPv4 networks, or persuade to their CP customers the performance benefits of IPv6 content delivery?"
An in-depth understanding of multipath TCP on mobile devices: measurement and system design,"Today's mobile devices are usually equipped with multiple wireless network interfaces that provide new opportunities for improving application performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study of multipath for mobile settings, focusing on MPTCP, with the goal of developing key insights for evolving the mobile multipath design. First, we conduct to our knowledge the most in-depth and the longest user trial of mobile multipath that focuses not only on MPTCP performance, but also on cross-layer interactions. Second, we identify a new research problem of multipath-aware CDN server selection. We demonstrate its real-world importance and provide recommendations. Third, our measurement findings lead us to design and implement a flexible software architecture for mobile multipath called MPFlex, which strategically employs multiplexing to improve multipath performance (by up to 63% for short-lived flows). MPFlex decouples the high-level scheduling algorithm and the low-level OS protocol implementation, and enables developers to flexibly plug-in new multipath features. MPFlex also provides an ideal vantage point for flexibly realizing user-specified multipath policies and is friendly to middleboxes."
Mobileinsight: extracting and analyzing cellular network information on smartphones,"We design and implement MobileInsight, a software tool that collects, analyzes and exploits runtime network information from operational cellular networks. MobileInsight runs on commercial off-the-shelf phones without extra hardware or additional support from operators. It exposes protocol messages on both control plane and (below IP) data plane from the 3G/4G chipset. It provides in-device protocol analysis and operation logic inference. It further offers a simple API, through which developers and researchers obtain access to low-level network information for their mobile applications. We have built three showcases to illustrate how MobileInsight is applied to cellular network research."

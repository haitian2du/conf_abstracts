DopEnc: acoustic-based encounter profiling using smartphones,"This paper presents DopEnc, an acoustic-based encounter profiling system on smartphones. DopEnc can automatically identify the persons that users interact with in the context of encountering. DopEnc performs encounter profiling in two major steps: (1) Doppler profiling to detect that two persons approach and stop in front of each other via an effective trajectory, and (2) voice profiling to confirm that they are thereafter engaged in an interactive conversation. DopEnc is further extended to support parallel acoustic exploration of many users by incorporating a unique multiple access scheme within the limited inaudible acoustic frequency band. All implementation of DopEnc is based on commodity sensors like speakers, microphones and accelerometers integrated on commercial-off-the-shelf smartphones. We evaluate DopEnc with detailed experiments and a real use-case study of 11 participants. Overall DopEnc achieves an accuracy of 6.9% false positive and 9.7% false negative in real usage."
RnB: rate and brightness adaptation for rate-distortion-energy tradeoff in HTTP adaptive streaming over mobile devices,"Video streaming is a prevalent mobile service that drains a significant amount of battery power. While various efforts have been made toward saving both video transfer and display energy, they are independently designed in an ad-hoc way and thereby can cause some non-apparent yet critical performance issues. To fill in this gap, this paper presents a fundamentally new design by jointly considering the end-to-end pipeline from the initial video encoding to the final mobile display. In essence, we shift the classic R-D tradeoff that has governed streaming system designs for decades to a fresh rate-distortion-energy (R-D-E) tradeoff specifically tailored for mobile devices. We present RnB, a video bitrate and display brightness adaptation platform that is standard-compliant, backward compatible, and device-neutral in order to achieve the proposed R-D-E tradeoff. RnB is empowered by some new discovery about the inherent relationship among bitrate, display brightness, and video quality as well as by an control-theoretic formulation to dynamically adapt the bitrate and scale the display brightness. Experimental results based on real-time implementation show that RnB can achieve an average of 19% energy reduction with final video quality comparable to conventional R-D based schemes."
LEO: scheduling sensor inference algorithms across heterogeneous mobile processors and network resources,"Mobile apps that use sensors to monitor user behavior often employ resource heavy inference algorithms that make computational offloading a common practice. However, existing schedulers/offloaders typically emphasize one primary offloading aspect without fully exploring complementary goals (e.g., heterogeneous resource management with only partial visibility into underlying algorithms, or concurrent sensor app execution on a single resource) and as a result, may overlook performance benefits pertinent to sensor processing."
Lasagna: towards deep hierarchical understanding and searching over mobile sensing data,"The proliferation of mobile devices has enabled extensive mobile-data supported applications, e.g., exercise and activity recognition and quantification. Typically, these applications need predefined features and are only applicable to predefined activities. In this work, we address the issue of deep understanding of arbitrary activities and semantic searching of any activity over massive mobile sensing data. The challenges stem from the rich dynamics and the wide-spectrum of activities that a human being could perform. We propose a hierarchical activity representation, extract common bases of motion data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging the power of deep neural networks, and propose a universal multi-resolution representation for all activities without prior knowledge. Based on this representation, we design an innovative system Lasagna to manage and search motion data semantically. We implement a prototype system and our comprehensive evaluations show that our system can achieve highly accurate activity classification (with precision 98.9%) and search (with recall almost 100% and precision about 90%) over a diverse set of activities."

Scission: Signal Characteristic-Based Sender Identification and Intrusion Detection in Automotive Networks,"Increased connectivity increases the attack vector. This also applies to connected vehicles in which vulnerabilities not only threaten digital values but also humans and the environment. Typically, attackers try to exploit the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, which is the most widely used standard for internal vehicle communication. Once an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) connected to the CAN bus is compromised, attackers can manipulate messages at will. The missing sender authentication by design of the CAN bus enables adversarial access to vehicle functions with severe consequences. In order to address this problem, we propose Scission, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) which uses fingerprints extracted from CAN frames, enabling the identification of sending ECUs. Scission utilizes physical characteristics from analog values of CAN frames to assess whether it was sent by the legitimate ECU. In addition, to detect comprised ECUs, the proposed system is able to recognize attacks from unmonitored and additional devices. We show that Scission is able to identify the sender with an average probability of 99.85%, during the evaluation on two series production cars and a prototype setup. Due to the robust design of the system, the evaluation shows that all false positives were prevented. Compared to previous approaches, we have significantly reduced hardware costs and increased identification rates, which enables a broad application of this technology."
Detecting Attacks Against Robotic Vehicles: A Control Invariant Approach,"Robotic vehicles (RVs), such as drones and ground rovers, are a type of cyber-physical systems that operate in the physical world under the control of computing components in the cyber world. Despite RVs' robustness against natural disturbances, cyber or physical attacks against RVs may lead to physical malfunction and subsequently disruption or failure of the vehicles' missions. To avoid or mitigate such consequences, it is essential to develop attack detection techniques for RVs. In this paper, we present a novel attack detection framework to identify external, physical attacks against RVs on the fly by deriving and monitoring Control Invariants (CI). More specifically, we propose a method to extract such invariants by jointly modeling a vehicle's physical properties, its control algorithm and the laws of physics. These invariants are represented in a state-space form, which can then be implemented and inserted into the vehicle's control program binary for runtime invariant check. We apply our CI framework to eleven RVs, including quadrotor, hexarotor, and ground rover, and show that the invariant check can detect three common types of physical attacks -- including sensor attack, actuation signal attack, and parameter attack -- with very low runtime overhead."
Truth Will Out: Departure-Based Process-Level Detection of Stealthy Attacks on Control Systems,"Recent incidents have shown that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are becoming increasingly susceptible to sophisticated and targeted attacks initiated by adversaries with high motivation, domain knowledge, and resources. Although traditional security mechanisms can be implemented at the IT-infrastructure level of such cyber-physical systems, the community has acknowledged that it is imperative to also monitor the process-level activity, as attacks on ICS may very well influence the physical process. In this paper, we present PASAD, a novel stealthy-attack detection mechanism that monitors time series of sensor measurements in real time for structural changes in the process behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and experiments on data from real systems. Experimental results show that PASAD is capable of detecting not only significant deviations in the process behavior, but also subtle attack-indicating changes, significantly raising the bar for strategic adversaries who may attempt to maintain their malicious manipulation within the noise level."
On the Safety of IoT Device Physical Interaction Control,"Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) platforms provide increased functionality to enable human interaction with the physical world in an autonomous manner. The physical interaction features of IoT platforms allow IoT devices to make an impact on the physical environment. However, such features also bring new safety challenges, where attackers can leverage stealthy physical interactions to launch attacks against IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a framework called IoTMon that discovers any possible physical interactions and generates all potential interaction chains across applications in the IoT environment. IoTMon also includes an assessment of the safety risk of each discovered inter-app interaction chain based on its physical influence. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation of IoTMon and present a comprehensive system evaluation on the Samsung SmartThings platform. We study 185 official SmartThings applications and find they can form 162 hidden inter-app interaction chains through physical surroundings. In particular, our experiment reveals that 37 interaction chains are highly risky and could be potentially exploited to impact the safety of the IoT~environment."

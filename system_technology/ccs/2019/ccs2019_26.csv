Multisketches: Practical Secure Sketches Using Off-the-Shelf Biometric Matching Algorithms,"Biometric authentication is increasingly being used for large scale human authentication and identification, creating the risk of leaking the biometric secrets of millions of users in the case of database compromise. Powerful ""fuzzy"" cryptographic techniques for biometric template protection, such as secure sketches, could help in principle, but go unused in practice. This is because they would require new biometric matching algorithms with potentially much diminished accuracy. We introduce a new primitive called a multisketch that generalizes secure sketches. Multisketches can work with existing biometric matching algorithms to generate strong cryptographic keys from biometric data reliably. A multisketch works on a biometric database containing multiple biometrics --- e.g., multiple fingerprints --- of a moderately large population of users (say, thousands). It conceals the correspondence between users and their biometric templates, preventing an attacker from learning the biometric data of a user in the advent of a breach, but enabling derivation of user-specific secret keys upon successful user authentication. We design a multisketch over tenprints --- fingerprints of ten fingers --- called TenSketch. We report on a prototype implementation of TenSketch, showing its feasibility in practice. We explore several possible attacks against TenSketch database and show, via simulations with real tenprint datasets, that an attacker must perform a large amount of computation to learn any meaningful information from a stolen TenSketch database."
28 Blinks Later: Tackling Practical Challenges of Eye Movement Biometrics,"In this work we address three overlooked practical challenges of continuous authentication systems based on eye movement biometrics: (i) changes in lighting conditions, (ii) task dependent features and the (iii) need for an accurate calibration phase. We collect eye movement data from 22 participants. To measure the effect of the three challenges, we collect data while varying the experimental conditions: users perform four different tasks, lighting conditions change over the course of the session and we collect data related to both accurate (user-specific) and inaccurate (generic) calibrations. To address changing lighting conditions, we identify the two main sources of light, i.e., screen brightness and ambient light, and we propose a pupil diameter correction mechanism based on these. We find that such mechanism can accurately adjust for the pupil shrinking or expanding in relation to the varying amount of light reaching the eye. To account for inaccurate calibrations, we augment the previously known feature set with new features based on binocular tracking, where the left and the right eye are tracked separately. We show that these features can be extremely distinctive even when using a generic calibration. We further apply a cross-task mapping function based on population data which systematically accounts for the dependency of features to tasks (e.g., reading a text and browsing a website lead to different eye movement dynamics). Using these enhancements, even while relaxing assumptions about the experimental conditions, we show that our system achieves significantly lower error rates compared to previous work. For intra-task authentication, without user-specific calibration and in variable screen brightness and ambient lighting, we achieve an equal error rate of 3.93% with only two minutes of training data. For the same setup but with constant screen brightness (e.g., as for a reading task) we can achieve equal error rates as low as of 1.88%."
Velody: Nonlinear Vibration Challenge-Response for Resilient User Authentication,"Biometrics have been widely adopted for enhancing user authentication, benefiting usability by exploiting pervasive and collectible unique characteristics from physiological or behavioral traits of human. However, successful attacks on ""static"" biometrics such as fingerprints have been reported where an adversary acquires users' biometrics stealthily and compromises non-resilient biometrics."
The Catcher in the Field: A Fieldprint based Spoofing Detection for Text-Independent Speaker Verification,"Verifying the identity of voice inputs is important as voices are increasingly used for sensitive operations. Traditional methods focus on differentiating individuals via the spectrographic features of voices (e.g., voiceprint), yet cannot cope with spoofing attacks, whereby a malicious attacker synthesizes the voice with almost the same voiceprint of a victim or simply replays it. This paper proposes CaField, a text-independent speaker verification method to detect loudspeaker-based voice spoofing attacks with the goal of achieving two seemingly conflicting requirements: usability and security. The key insight of CaField is to construct ""fieldprint'' with the acoustic biometrics embedded in sound fields, i.e., a physical field of acoustic energy created as the sound propagates over the air, as analogous to ""voiceprint''. We find that fieldprints can be distinctive between speakers (either humans or loudspeakers), and thus we may detect the speakers being used for spoofing attacks from the authentic users. Our evaluation on a dataset of 20 people and 8 loudspeakers shows that by relying on two on-board microphones to sample sound fields while users talk to the smartphones, CaField achieves a detection accuracy of 99.16% and an equal error rate (EER) of 0.85% across multiple sessions and various voice inputs. CaField supports low audio sample rates at 8~kHz and is robust to various factors including phone displacement, user posture, recording environment, etc."

Exploiting Symmetries When Proving Equivalence Properties for Security Protocols,"Verification of privacy-type properties for cryptographic protocols in an active adversarial environment, modelled as a behavioural equivalence in concurrent-process calculi, exhibits a high computational complexity. While undecidable in general, for some classes of common cryptographic primitives the problem is coNEXP-complete when the number of honest participants is bounded."
Are These Pairing Elements Correct?: Automated Verification and Applications,"Using a set of pairing product equations (PPEs) to verify the correctness of an untrusted set of pairing elements with respect to another set of trusted elements has numerous cryptographic applications. These include the design of basic and structure-preserving signature schemes, building oblivious transfer schemes from ""blind"" IBE, finding new verifiable random functions and keeping the IBE/ABE authority ""accountable"" to the user."
Post-Collusion Security and Distance Bounding,"Verification of cryptographic protocols is traditionally built upon the assumption that participants have not revealed their long-term keys. However, in some cases, participants might collude to defeat some security goals, without revealing their long-term secrets."

"""I don't see why I would ever want to use it"": Analyzing the Usability of Popular Smartphone Password Managers","Passwords are an often unavoidable authentication mechanism, despite the availability of additional alternative means. In the case of smartphones, usability problems are aggravated because interaction happens through small screens and multilayer keyboards. While password managers (PMs) can improve this situation and contribute to hardening security, their adoption is far from widespread. To understand the underlying reasons, we conducted the first empirical usability study of mobile PMs, covering both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our findings show that popular PMs are barely acceptable according to the standard System Usability Scale, and that there are three key areas for improvement: integration with external applications, security, and user guidance and interaction. We build on the collected evidence to suggest recommendations that can fill this gap."
Matched and Mismatched SOCs: A Qualitative Study on Security Operations Center Issues,"Organizations, such as companies and governments, created Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to defend against computer security attacks. SOCs are central defense groups that focus on security incident management with capabilities such as monitoring, preventing, responding, and reporting. They are one of the most critical defense components of a modern organization's defense. Despite their critical importance to organizations, and the high frequency of reported security incidents, only a few research studies focus on problems specific to SOCs. In this study, to understand and identify the issues of SOCs, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with SOC analysts and managers who work for organizations from different industry sectors. Through our analysis of the interview data, we identified technical and non-technical issues that exist in SOC. Moreover, we found inherent disagreements between SOC managers and their analysts that, if not addressed, could entail a risk to SOC efficiency and effectiveness. We distill these issues into takeaways that apply both to future academic research and to SOC management. We believe that research should focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SOCs."
A Usability Evaluation of Let's Encrypt and Certbot: Usable Security Done Right,"The correct configuration of HTTPS is a complex set of tasks, which many administrators have struggled with in the past. Let's Encrypt and Electronic Frontier Foundation's Certbot aim to improve the TLS ecosystem by offering free trusted certificates (Let's Encrypt) and by providing user-friendly support to configure and harden TLS (Certbot). Although adoption rates have increased, to date, there has been only a little scientific evidence of the actual usability and security benefits of this semi-automated approach. Therefore, we conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the usability of Let's Encrypt and Certbot in comparison to the traditional certificate authority approach. We performed a within-subjects lab study with 31 participants. The study sheds light on the security and usability enhancements that Let's Encrypt and Certbot provide. We highlight how usability improvements aimed at administrators can have a large impact on security and discuss takeaways for Certbot and other security-related tasks that experts struggle with."

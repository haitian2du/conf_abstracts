Host of Troubles: Multiple Host Ambiguities in HTTP Implementations,"The Host header is a security-critical component in an HTTP request, as it is used as the basis for enforcing security and caching policies. While the current specification is generally clear on how host-related protocol fields should be parsed and interpreted, we find that the implementations are problematic. We tested a variety of widely deployed HTTP implementations and discover a wide range of non-compliant and inconsistent host processing behaviours. The particular problem is that when facing a carefully crafted HTTP request with ambiguous host fields (e.g., with multiple Host headers), two different HTTP implementations often accept and understand it differently when operating on the same request in sequence. We show a number of techniques to induce inconsistent interpretations of host between HTTP implementations and how the inconsistency leads to severe attacks such as HTTP cache poisoning and security policy bypass. The prevalence of the problem highlights the potential negative impact of gaps between the specifications and implementations of Internet protocols."
Accessorize to a Crime: Real and Stealthy Attacks on State-of-the-Art Face Recognition,"Machine learning is enabling a myriad innovations, including new algorithms for cancer diagnosis and self-driving cars. The broad use of machine learning makes it important to understand the extent to which machine-learning algorithms are subject to attack, particularly when used in applications where physical security or safety is at risk."
Lurking Malice in the Cloud: Understanding and Detecting Cloud Repository as a Malicious Service,"The popularity of cloud hosting services also brings in new security challenges: it has been reported that these services are increasingly utilized by miscreants for their malicious online activities. Mitigating this emerging threat, posed by such ""bad repositories"" (simply Bar), is challenging due to the different hosting strategy to traditional hosting service, the lack of direct observations of the repositories by those outside the cloud, the reluctance of the cloud provider to scan its customers' repositories without their consent, and the unique evasion strategies employed by the adversary. In this paper, we took the first step toward understanding and detecting this emerging threat. Using a small set of ""seeds"" (i.e., confirmed Bars), we identified a set of collective features from the websites they serve (e.g., attempts to hide Bars), which uniquely characterize the Bars. These features were utilized to build a scanner that detected over 600 Bars on leading cloud platforms like Amazon, Google, and 150K sites, including popular ones like groupon.com, using them. Highlights of our study include the pivotal roles played by these repositories on malicious infrastructures and other important discoveries include how the adversary exploited legitimate cloud repositories and why the adversary uses Bars in the first place that has never been reported. These findings bring such malicious services to the spotlight and contribute to a better understanding and ultimately eliminating this new threat."

Slitheen: Perfectly Imitated Decoy Routing through Traffic Replacement,"As the capabilities of censors increase and their ability to perform more powerful deep-packet inspection techniques grows, more powerful systems are needed in turn to disguise user traffic and allow users under a censor's influence to access blocked content on the Internet. Decoy routing is a censorship resistance technique that hides traffic under the guise of a HTTPS connection to a benign, uncensored overt site. However, existing techniques far from perfectly mimic a typical access of content on the overt server. Artificial latency introduced by the system, as well as differences in packet sizes and timings betray their use to a censor capable of performing basic packet and latency analysis. While many of the more recent decoy routing systems focus on deployability concerns, they do so at the cost of security, adding vulnerabilities to both passive and active attacks. We propose Slitheen, a decoy routing system capable of perfectly mimicking the traffic patterns of overt sites. Our system is secure against previously undefended passive attacks, as well as known active attacks. Further, we show how recent innovations in traffic-shaping technology for ISPs mitigate previous deployability challenges."
Practical Censorship Evasion Leveraging Content Delivery Networks,"CDNBrowsing is a promising approach recently proposed for censorship circumvention. CDNBrowsing relies on the fact that blocking content hosted on public CDNs can potentially cause the censors collateral damage due to disrupting benign content publishers. In this work, we identify various low-cost attacks against CDNBrowsing, demonstrating that the design of practically unobservable CDNBrowsing systems is significantly more challenging than what thought previously. We particularly devise unique website fingerprinting attacks against CDNBrowsing traffic, and discover various forms of information leakage in HTTPS that can be used to block the previously proposed CDNBrowsing system. Motivated by the attacks, we design and implement a new CDNBrowsing system called CDNReaper, which defeats the discovered attacks. By design, a CDNBrowsing system can browse only particular types of webpages due to its proxy-less design. We perform a comprehensive measurement to classify popular Internet websites based on their browsability by CDNBrowsing systems. To further increase the reach of CDNBrowsing, we devise several mechanisms that enable CDNBrowsing systems to browse a larger extent of Internet webpages, particularly partial-CDN webpages."
GAME OF DECOYS: Optimal Decoy Routing Through Game Theory,"Decoy routing is a promising new approach for censorship circumvention that relies on traffic re-direction by volunteer autonomous systems. Decoy routing is subject to a fundamental censorship attack, called routing around decoy (RAD), in which the censors re-route their clients' Internet traffic in order to evade decoy routing autonomous systems. Recently, there has been a heated debate in the community on the real-world feasibility of decoy routing in the presence of the RAD attack. Unfortunately, previous studies rely their analysis on heuristic-based mechanisms for decoy placement strategies as well as ad hoc strategies for the implementation of the RAD attack by the censors. In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of decoy routing in the presence of the RAD attack. We use game theory to model the interactions between decoy router deployers and the censors in various settings. Our game-theoretic analysis finds the optimal decoy placement strategies---as opposed to heuristic-based placements---in the presence of RAD censors who take their optimal censorship actions---as opposed to some ad hoc implementation of RAD. That is, we investigate the best decoy placement given the best RAD censorship."

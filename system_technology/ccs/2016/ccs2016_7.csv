AUDACIOUS: User-Driven Access Control with Unmodified Operating Systems,"User-driven access control improves the coarse-grained access control of current operating systems (particularly in the mobile space) that provide only all-or-nothing access to a resource such as the camera or the current location. By granting appropriate permissions only in response to explicit user actions (for example, pressing a camera button), user-driven access control better aligns application actions with user expectations. Prior work on user-driven access control has relied in essential ways on operating system (OS) modifications to provide applications with uncompromisable access control gadgets, distinguished user interface (UI) elements that can grant access permissions. This work presents a design, implementation, and evaluation of user-driven access control that works with no OS modifications, thus making deployability and incremental adoption of the model more feasible. We develop (1) a user-level trusted library for access control gadgets, (2) static analyses to prevent malicious creation of UI events, illegal flows of sensitive information, and circumvention of our library, and (3) dynamic analyses to ensure users are not tricked into granting permissions. In addition to providing the original user-driven access control guarantees, we use static information flow to limit where results derived from sensitive sources may flow in an application."
Mix&Slice: Efficient Access Revocation in the Cloud,"We present an approach to enforce access revocation on resources stored at external cloud providers. The approach relies on a resource transformation that provides strong mutual inter-dependency in its encrypted representation. To revoke access on a resource, it is then sufficient to update a small portion of it, with the guarantee that the resource as a whole (and any portion of it) will become unintelligible to those from whom access is revoked. The extensive experimental evaluation on a variety of configurations confirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution, which showed excellent performance and compatibility with several implementation strategies."

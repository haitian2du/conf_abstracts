On Code Execution Tracking via Power Side-Channel,"With the proliferation of Internet of Things, there is a growing interest in embedded system attacks, e.g., key extraction attacks and firmware modification attacks. Code execution tracking, as the first step to locate vulnerable instruction pieces for key extraction attacks and to conduct control-flow integrity checking against firmware modification attacks, is therefore of great value. Because embedded systems, especially legacy embedded systems, have limited resources and may not support software or hardware update, it is important to design low-cost code execution tracking methods that require as little system modification as possible. In this work, we propose a non-intrusive code execution tracking solution via power-side channel, wherein we represent the code execution and its power consumption with a revised hidden Markov model and recover the most likely executed instruction sequence with a revised Viterbi algorithm. By observing the power consumption of the microcontroller unit during execution, we are able to recover the program execution flow with a high accuracy and detect abnormal code execution behavior even when only a single instruction is modified."
Coverage-based Greybox Fuzzing as Markov Chain,"Coverage-based Greybox Fuzzing (CGF) is a random testing approach that requires no program analysis. A new test is generated by slightly mutating a seed input. If the test exercises a new and interesting path, it is added to the set of seeds; otherwise, it is discarded. We observe that most tests exercise the same few ""high-frequency"" paths and develop strategies to explore significantly more paths with the same number of tests by gravitating towards low-frequency paths. We explain the challenges and opportunities of CGF using a Markov chain model which specifies the probability that fuzzing the seed that exercises path i generates an input that exercises path j. Each state (i.e., seed) has an energy that specifies the number of inputs to be generated from that seed. We show that CGF is considerably more efficient if energy is inversely proportional to the density of the stationary distribution and increases monotonically every time that seed is chosen. Energy is controlled with a power schedule."
Error Handling of In-vehicle Networks Makes Them Vulnerable,"Contemporary vehicles are getting equipped with an increasing number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and wireless connectivities. Although these have enhanced vehicle safety and efficiency, they are accompanied with new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we unveil a new important vulnerability applicable to several in-vehicle networks including Control Area Network (CAN), the de facto standard in-vehicle network protocol. Specifically, we propose a new type of Denial-of-Service (DoS), called the bus-off attack, which exploits the error-handling scheme of in-vehicle networks to disconnect or shut down good/uncompromised ECUs. This is an important attack that must be thwarted, since the attack, once an ECU is compromised, is easy to be mounted on safety-critical ECUs while its prevention is very difficult. In addition to the discovery of this new vulnerability, we analyze its feasibility using actual in-vehicle network traffic, and demonstrate the attack on a CAN bus prototype as well as on two real vehicles. Based on our analysis and experimental results, we also propose and evaluate a mechanism to detect and prevent the bus-off attack."

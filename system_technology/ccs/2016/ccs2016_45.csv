A Protocol for Privately Reporting Ad Impressions at Scale,"We present a protocol to enable privacy preserving advertising reporting at scale. Unlike previous systems, our work scales to millions of users and tens of thousands of distinct ads. Our approach builds on the homomorphic encryption approach proposed by Adnostic, but uses new cryptographic proof techniques to efficiently report billions of ad impressions a day using an additively homomorphic voting schemes. Most importantly, our protocol scales without imposing high loads on trusted third parties. Finally, we investigate a cost effective method to privately deliver ads with computational private information retrieval."
Secure Stable Matching at Scale,"When a group of individuals and organizations wish to compute a stable matching---for example, when medical students are matched to medical residency programs---they often outsource the computation to a trusted arbiter in order to preserve the privacy of participants' preferences. Secure multi-party computation offers the possibility of private matching processes that do not rely on any common trusted third party. However, stable matching algorithms have previously been considered infeasible for execution in a secure multi-party context on non-trivial inputs because they are computationally intensive and involve complex data-dependent memory access patterns."
BeleniosRF: A Non-interactive Receipt-Free Electronic Voting Scheme,"We propose a new voting scheme, BeleniosRF, that offers both receipt-freeness and end-to-end verifiability. It is receipt-free in a strong sense, meaning that even dishonest voters cannot prove how they voted. We provide a game-based definition of receipt-freeness for voting protocols with non-interactive ballot casting, which we name strong receipt-freeness (sRF). To our knowledge, sRF is the first game-based definition of receipt-freeness in the literature, and it has the merit of being particularly concise and simple. Built upon the Helios protocol, BeleniosRF inherits its simplicity and does not require any anti-coercion strategy from the voters. We implement BeleniosRF and show its feasibility on a number of platforms, including desktop computers and smartphones."

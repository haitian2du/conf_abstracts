New Techniques for Structural Batch Verification in Bilinear Groups with Applications to Groth-Sahai Proofs,"Bilinear groups form the algebraic setting for a multitude of important cryptographic protocols including anonymous credentials, e-cash, e-voting, e-coupon, and loyalty systems. It is typical of such crypto protocols that participating parties need to repeatedly verify that certain equations over bilinear groups are satisfied, e.g., to check that computed signatures are valid, commitments can be opened, or non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs verify correctly. Depending on the form and number of equations this part can quickly become a performance bottleneck due to the costly evaluation of the bilinear map."
Practical Quantum-Safe Voting from Lattices,"We propose a lattice-based electronic voting scheme, EVOLVE (Electronic Voting from Lattices with Verification), which is conjectured to resist attacks by quantum computers. Our protocol involves a number of voting authorities so that vote privacy is maintained as long as at least one of the authorities is honest, while the integrity of the result is guaranteed even when all authorities collude. Furthermore, the result of the vote can be independently computed by any observer. At the core of the protocol is the utilization of a homomorphic commitment scheme with strategically orchestrated zero-knowledge proofs: voters use approximate but efficient ""Fiat-Shamir with Aborts"" proofs to show the validity of their vote, while the authorities use amortized exact proofs to show that the commitments are well-formed. We also present a novel efficient zero-knowledge proof that one of two lattice-based statements is true (so-called OR proof) and a new mechanism to control the size of the randomness when applying the homomorphism to commitments. We give concrete parameter choices to securely instantiate and evaluate the efficiency of our scheme. Our prototype implementation shows that the voters require $8$ milliseconds to submit a vote of size about $20$KB to each authority and it takes each authority $0.15$ seconds per voter to create a proof that his vote was valid. The size of the vote share that each authority produces is approximately $15$KB per voter, which we believe is well within the practical bounds for a large-scale election."

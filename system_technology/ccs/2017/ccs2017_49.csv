TinyOLE: Efficient Actively Secure Two-Party Computation from Oblivious Linear Function Evaluation,"We introduce a new approach to actively secure two-party computation based on so-called oblivious linear function evaluation (OLE), a natural generalisation of oblivious transfer (OT) and a special case of the notion of oblivious polynomial evaluation introduced by Naor and Pinkas at STOC 1999. OLE works over a finite field F. In an OLE the sender inputs two field elements a ƒ F and b ƒ F, and the receiver inputs a field element x ∈ F and learns only ƒx) = ax + b. Our protocol can evaluate an arithmetic circuit over a finite field F given black-box access to OLE for F. The protocol is unconditionally secure and consumes only a constant number of OLEs per multiplication gate. An OLE over a field F of size O(2κ) be implemented with communication O(κ). This gives a protocol with communication complexity O(C κ) for large enough fields, where C is an arithmetic circuit computing the desired function."
Efficient Public Trace and Revoke from Standard Assumptions: Extended Abstract,"We provide efficient constructions for trace-and-revoke systems with public traceability in the black-box confirmation model. Our constructions achieve adaptive security, are based on standard assumptions and achieve significant efficiency gains compared to previous constructions."
Distributed Measurement with Private Set-Union Cardinality,"This paper introduces a cryptographic protocol for efficiently aggregating a count of unique items across a set of data parties privately - that is, without exposing any information other than the count. Our protocol allows for more secure and useful statistics gathering in privacy-preserving distributed systems such as anonymity networks; for example, it allows operators of anonymity networks such as Tor to securely answer the questions: how many unique users are using the distributed service? and how many hidden services are being accessed?. We formally prove the correctness and security of our protocol in the Universal Composability framework against an active adversary that compromises all but one of the aggregation parties. We also show that the protocol provides security against adaptive corruption of the data parties, which prevents them from being victims of targeted compromise. To ensure safe measurements, we also show how the output can satisfy differential privacy."

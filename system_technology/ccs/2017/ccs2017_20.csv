Client-side Name Collision Vulnerability in the New gTLD Era: A Systematic Study,"The recent unprecedented delegation of new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) has exacerbated an existing, but fallow, problem called name collisions. One concrete exploit of such problem was discovered recently, which targets internal namespaces and enables Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks against end-user devices from anywhere on the Internet. Analysis of the underlying problem shows that it is not specific to any single service protocol, but little attention has been paid to understand the vulnerability status and the defense solution space at the service level. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of the robustness of internal network services under name collision attacks."
The Wolf of Name Street: Hijacking Domains Through Their Nameservers,"The functionality and security of all domain names are contingent upon their nameservers. When these nameservers, or requests to them, are compromised, all domains that rely on them are affected. In this paper, we study the exploitation of configuration issues (typosquatting and outdated WHOIS records) and hardware errors (bitsquatting) to seize control over nameservers' requests to hijack domains. We perform a large-scale analysis of 10,000 popular nameserver domains, in which we map out existing abuse and vulnerable entities. We confirm the capabilities of these attacks through real-world measurements. Overall, we find that over 12,000 domains are susceptible to near-immediate compromise, while 52.8M domains are being targeted by nameserver bitsquatters that respond with rogue IP addresses. Additionally, we determine that 1.28M domains are at risk of a denial-of-service attack by relying on an outdated nameserver."
Faulds: A Non-Parametric Iterative Classifier for Internet-Wide OS Fingerprinting,"Recent work in OS fingerprinting has focused on overcoming random distortion in network and user features during Internet-scale SYN scans. These classification techniques work under an assumption that all parameters of the profiled network are known a-priori -- the likelihood of packet loss, the popularity of each OS, the distribution of network delay, and the probability of user modification to each default TCP/IP header value. However, it is currently unclear how to obtain realistic versions of these parameters for the public Internet and/or customize them to a particular network being analyzed. To address this issue, we derive a non-parametric Expectation-Maximization (EM) estimator, which we call Faulds, for the unknown distributions involved in single-probe OS fingerprinting and demonstrate its significantly higher robustness to noise compared to methods in prior work. We apply Faulds to a new scan of 67M webservers and discuss its findings."

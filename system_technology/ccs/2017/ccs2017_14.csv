Verifying Security Policies in Multi-agent Workflows with Loops,"We consider the automatic verification of information flow security policies of web-based workflows, such as conference submission systems like EasyChair. Our workflow description language allows for loops, non-deterministic choice, and an unbounded number of participating agents. The information flow policies are specified in a temporal logic for hyperproperties. We show that the verification problem can be reduced to the satisfiability of a formula of first-order linear-time temporal logic, and provide decidability results for relevant classes of workflows and specifications. We report on experimental results obtained with an implementation of our approach on a series of benchmarks."
Attribute-Based Encryption in the Generic Group Model: Automated Proofs and New Constructions,"Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a cryptographic primitive which supports fine-grained access control on encrypted data, making it an appealing building block for many applications. In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate fully automated methods for proving security of ABE in the Generic Bilinear Group Model (Boneh, Boyen, and Goh, 2005, Boyen, 2008), an idealized model which admits simpler and more efficient constructions, and can also be used to find attacks. Our method is applicable to Rational-Fraction Induced ABE, a large class of ABE that contains most of the schemes from the literature, and relies on a Master Theorem, which reduces security in the GGM to a (new) notion of symbolic security, which is amenable to automated verification using constraint-based techniques. We relate our notion of symbolic security for Rational-Fraction Induced ABE to prior notions for Pair Encodings. Finally, we present several applications, including automated proofs for new schemes."
FAME: Fast Attribute-based Message Encryption,"Time and again, attribute-based encryption has been shown to be the natural cryptographic tool for building various types of conditional access systems with far-reaching applications, but the deployment of such systems has been very slow. A central issue is the lack of an encryption scheme that can operate on sensitive data very efficiently and, at the same time, provides features that are important in practice."

DUPLO: Unifying Cut-and-Choose for Garbled Circuits,"Cut-and-choose (CC) is the standard approach to making Yao's garbled circuit two-party computation (2PC) protocol secure against malicious adversaries. Traditional cut-and-choose operates at the level of entire circuits, whereas the LEGO paradigm (Nielsen & Orlandi, TCC 2009) achieves asymptotic improvements by performing cut-and-choose at the level of individual gates. In this work we propose a unified approach called DUPLO that spans the entire continuum between these two extremes. The cut-and-choose step in our protocol operates on the level of arbitrary circuit ""components,"" which can range in size from a single gate to the entire circuit itself."
Authenticated Garbling and Efficient Maliciously Secure Two-Party Computation,"We propose a simple and efficient framework for obtaining efficient constant-round protocols for maliciously secure two-party computation. Our framework uses a function-independent preprocessing phase to generate authenticated information for the two parties; this information is then used to construct a single ""authenticated"" garbled circuit which is transmitted and evaluated. We also show how to efficiently instantiate the preprocessing phase with a new, highly optimized version of the TinyOT protocol by Nielsen et al."
Global-Scale Secure Multiparty Computation,"We propose a new, constant-round protocol for multi-party computation of boolean circuits that is secure against an arbitrary number of malicious corruptions. At a high level, we extend and generalize recent work of Wang et al. in the two-party setting. Namely, we design an efficient preprocessing phase that allows the parties to generate authenticated information; we then show how to use this information to distributively construct a single ""authenticated"" garbled circuit that is evaluated by one party."

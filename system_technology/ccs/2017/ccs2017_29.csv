Querying for Queries: Indexes of Queries for Efficient and Expressive IT-PIR,"We propose indexes of queries, a novel mechanism for supporting efficient, expressive, and information-theoretically private single-round queries over multi-server PIR databases. Our approach decouples the way that users construct their requests for data from the physical layout of the remote data store, thereby enabling users to fetch data using ""contextual"" queries that specify which data they seek, as opposed to ""positional"" queries that specify where those data happen to reside. For example, an open-access eprint repository could employ indexes of queries to let researchers fetch academic articles via PIR queries such as for ""this year's 5 most cited papers about PIR"" or ""the 3 most recently posted papers about PIR"". Our basic approach is compatible with any PIR protocol in the ubiquitous ""vector-matrix"" model for PIR, though the most sophisticated and useful of our constructions rely on some nice algebraic properties of Goldberg's IT-PIR protocol (Oakland 2007). We have implemented our techniques as an extension to Percy++, an open-source implementation of Goldberg's IT-PIR protocol. Our experiments indicate that the new techniques can greatly improve not only utility for private information retrievers but also efficiency for private information retrievers and servers alike."
PeGaSus: Data-Adaptive Differentially Private Stream Processing,"Individuals are continually observed by an ever-increasing number of sensors that make up the Internet of Things. The resulting streams of data, which are analyzed in real time, can reveal sensitive personal information about individuals. Hence, there is an urgent need for stream processing solutions that can analyze these data in real time with provable guarantees of privacy and low error."
Composing Differential Privacy and Secure Computation: A Case Study on Scaling Private Record Linkage,"Private record linkage (PRL) is the problem of identifying pairs of records that are similar as per an input matching rule from databases held by two parties that do not trust one another. We identify three key desiderata that a PRL solution must ensure: (1) perfect precision and high recall of matching pairs, (2) a proof of end-to-end privacy, and (3) communication and computational costs that scale subquadratically in the number of input records. We show that all of the existing solutions for PRL? including secure 2-party computation (S2PC), and their variants that use non-private or differentially private (DP) blocking to ensure subquadratic cost -- violate at least one of the three desiderata. In particular, S2PC techniques guarantee end-to-end privacy but have either low recall or quadratic cost. In contrast, no end-to-end privacy guarantee has been formalized for solutions that achieve subquadratic cost. This is true even for solutions that compose DP and S2PC: DP does not permit the release of any exact information about the databases, while S2PC algorithms for PRL allow the release of matching records."

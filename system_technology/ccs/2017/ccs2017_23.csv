Exploiting a Thermal Side Channel for Power Attacks in Multi-Tenant Data Centers,"The power capacity of multi-tenant data centers is typically oversubscribed in order to increase the utilization of expensive power infrastructure. This practice can create dangerous situations and compromise data center availability if the designed power capacity is exceeded. This paper demonstrates that current safeguards are vulnerable to well-timed power attacks launched by malicious tenants (i.e., attackers). Further, we demonstrate that there is a physical side channel --- a thermal side channel due to hot air recirculation --- that contains information about the benign tenants' runtime power usage and can enable a malicious tenant to time power attacks effectively. In particular, we design a state-augmented Kalman filter to extract this information from the side channel and guide an attacker to use its maximum power at moments that coincide with the benign tenants' high power demand, thus overloading the shared power capacity. Our experimental results show that an attacker can capture 54% of all attack opportunities, significantly compromising the data center availability. Finally, we discuss a set of possible defense strategies to safeguard the data center infrastructure against power attacks."
"Watch Me, but Don't Touch Me! Contactless Control Flow Monitoring via Electromagnetic Emanations","Trustworthy operation of industrial control systems depends on secure and real-time code execution on the embedded programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The controllers monitor and control the critical infrastructures, such as electric power grids and healthcare platforms, and continuously report back the system status to human operators. We present Zeus, a contactless embedded controller security monitor to ensure its execution control flow integrity. Zeus leverages the electromagnetic emission by the PLC circuitry during the execution of the controller programs. Zeus's contactless execution tracking enables non-intrusive monitoring of security-critical controllers with tight real-time constraints. Those devices often cannot tolerate the cost and performance overhead that comes with additional traditional hardware or software monitoring modules. Furthermore, Zeus provides an air-gap between the monitor (trusted computing base) and the target (potentially compromised) PLC. This eliminates the possibility of the monitor infection by the same attack vectors."
Viden: Attacker Identification on In-Vehicle Networks,"Various defense schemes --- which determine the presence of an attack on the in-vehicle network --- have recently been proposed. However, they fail to identify which Electronic Control Unit (ECU) actually mounted the attack. Clearly, pinpointing the attacker ECU is essential for fast/efficient forensic, isolation, security patch, etc. To meet this need, we propose a novel scheme, called Viden (Voltage-based attacker identification), which can identify the attacker ECU by measuring and utilizing voltages on the in-vehicle network. The first phase of Viden, called ACK learning, determines whether or not the measured voltage signals really originate from the genuine message transmitter. Viden then exploits the voltage measurements to construct and update the transmitter ECUs' voltage profiles as their fingerprints. It finally uses the voltage profiles to identify the attacker ECU. Since Viden adapts its profiles to changes inside/outside of the vehicle, it can pinpoint the attacker ECU under various conditions. Moreover, its efficiency and design-compliance with modern in-vehicle network implementations make Viden practical and easily deployable. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both a CAN bus prototype and two real vehicles have shown that Viden can accurately fingerprint ECUs based solely on voltage measurements and thus identify the attacker ECU with a low false identification rate of 0.2%."

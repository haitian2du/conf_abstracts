SparSDR: Sparsity-proportional Backhaul and Compute for SDRs,"We present SparSDR, a resource-efficient architecture for softwaredefined radios whose backhaul bandwidth and compute power requirements scale in inverse proportion to the sparsity (in time and frequency) of the signals received. SparSDR requires dramatically fewer resources than existing approaches to process many popular protocols while retaining both flexibility and fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach has negligible impact on signal quality, receiver sensitivity, and processing latency. The SparSDR architecture makes it possible to capture signals across bandwidths far wider than the capacity of a radio's backhaul through the addition of lightweight frontend processing and corresponding backend reconstruction to restore the signals to their original sample rate. We employ SparSDR to develop two wideband applications running on a USRP N210 and a Raspberry Pi 3+: an IoT sniffer that scans 100 MHz of bandwidth and decodes received BLE packets, and a wideband Cloud SDR receiver that requires only residential-class Internet uplink capacity. We show that our SparSDR implementation fits in the constrained resources of popular low-cost SDR platforms, such as the AD Pluto."
This is Your President Speaking: Spoofing Alerts in 4G LTE Networks,"Modern cell phones are required to receive and display alerts via the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) program, under the mandate of the Warning, Alert, and Response Act of 2006. These alerts include AMBER alerts, severe weather alerts, and (unblockable) Presidential Alerts, intended to inform the public of imminent threats. Recently, a test Presidential Alert was sent to all capable phones in the United States, prompting concerns about how the underlying WEA protocol could be misused or attacked. In this paper, we investigate the details of this system, and develop and demonstrate the first practical spoofing attack on Presidential Alerts, using both commercially available hardware as well as modified open source software. Our attack can be performed using a commercially-available software defined radio, and our modifications to the open source NextEPC and srsLTE software libraries. We find that with only four malicious portable base stations of a single Watt of transmit power each, almost all of a 50,000-seat stadium can be attacked with a 90% success rate. The true impact of such an attack would of course depend on the density of cell phones in range; fake alerts in crowded cities or stadiums could potentially result in cascades of panic. Fixing this problem will require a large collaborative effort between carriers, government stakeholders, and cell phone manufacturers. To seed this effort, we also discuss several defenses to address this threat in both the short and long term."
CASTLE over the Air: Distributed Scheduling for Cellular Data Transmissions,"This paper presents a fully distributed scheduling framework called CASTLE (Client-side Adaptive Scheduler That minimizes Load and Energy), which jointly optimizes the spectral efficiency of cellular networks and battery consumption of smart devices. To do so, we focus on scenarios when many smart devices compete for cellular resources in the same base station: spreading out transmissions over time so that only a few devices transmit at once improves both spectral efficiency and battery consumption. To this end, we devise two novel features in CASTLE. First, we explicitly consider inter-cell interference for accurate cellular load estimation. Based on our observations, we exploit the RSRQ (Reference Signal Received Quality) and SINR as features in a machine learning algorithm to accurately estimate the cellular load. Second, we propose a fully distributed scheduling algorithm that coordinates transmissions between clients based on the locally estimated load level at each client. Our formulation for minimizing battery consumption at each device leads to an optimized backoff-based algorithm that fits practical environments. To evaluate these features, we prototype a complete LTE system testbed consisting of mobile devices, eNodeBs, EPC (Evolved Packet Core) and application servers. Our comprehensive experimental results show that CASTLE's load estimation is up to 91% accurate, and that CASTLE achieves higher spectral efficiency with less battery consumption, compared to existing centralized scheduling algorithms as well as a distributed CSMA-like protocol. Furthermore, we develop a light-weight SDK that can expedite the deployment of CASTLE into smart devices and evaluate it in a commercial LTE network."
"WatchTower: Fast, Secure Mobile Page Loads Using Remote Dependency Resolution","Remote dependency resolution (RDR) is a proxy-driven scheme for reducing mobile page load times; a proxy loads a requested page using a local browser, fetching the page's resources over fast proxy-origin links instead of a client's slow last-mile links. In this paper, we describe two fundamental challenges to efficient RDR proxying: the increasing popularity of encrypted HTTPS content, and the fact that, due to time-dependent network conditions and page properties, RDR proxying can actually increase load times. We solve these problems by introducing a new, secure proxying scheme for HTTPS traffic, and by implementing WatchTower, a selective proxying system that uses dynamic models of network conditions and page structures to only enable RDR when it is predicted to help. WatchTower loads pages 21.2%-41.3% faster than state-of-the-art proxies and server push systems, while preserving end-to-end HTTPS security."
Toward Reliable Localization by Unequal AoA Tracking,"Emerging applications require the location information of clients to enable human-environment interactions or personalized services. With an increasing number of antennas equipped in today's wireless devices, recent research has shown possibility of sub-meter level localization based only on the angle of arrival (AoA) of WiFi sig- nals. While most existing work provides promising median accu- racy, their tail performance however is usually far worse. We ob- serve from measurements that the root cause is due to unequal AoA estimation reliability. In some critical areas, a small variation in the channel state information of signals could introduce an extremely large AoA estimation error. With this observation, we propose UAT (Unequal Angle Tracking), a confidence-aware AoA-based localiza- tion system. We show that unequal reliability of AoA measures can be mathematically quantified, allowing a system to weigh the de- cisions of different APs according to their confidence. Our testbed evaluation shows that UAT's confidence-aware design provides reli- able decimeter level localization for around 90% of locations. UAT is especially effective for risky areas and can reduce their localiza- tion errors by 27.5%, as compared to reliability-oblivious designs."

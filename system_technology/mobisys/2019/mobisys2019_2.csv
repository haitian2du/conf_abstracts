FlyZone: A Testbed for Experimenting with Aerial Drone Applications,"FlyZone is a testbed architecture to experiment with aerial drone applications. Unlike most existing drone testbeds that focus on low-level mechanical control, FlyZone offers a high-level API and features geared towards experimenting with application-level functionality. These include the emulation of environment influences, such as wind, and the automatic monitoring of developer-provided safety constraints, for example, to mimic obstacles. We conceive novel solutions to achieve this functionality, including a hardware/software architecture that maximizes decoupling from the main application and a custom visual localization technique expressly designed for testbed operation. We deploy two instances of FlyZone and study performance and effectiveness. We demonstrate that we realistically emulate the environment influence with a positioning error bound by the size of the smallest drone we test, that our localization technique provides a root mean square error of 9.2cm, and that detection of violations to safety constraints happens with a 50ms worst-case latency. We also report on how FlyZone supported developing three real-world drone applications, and discuss a user study demonstrating the benefits of FlyZone compared to drone simulators."
InternalBlue - Bluetooth Binary Patching and Experimentation Framework,"Bluetooth is one of the most established technologies for short range digital wireless data transmission. With the advent of wearables and the Internet of Things (IoT), Bluetooth has again gained importance, which makes security research and protocol optimizations imperative. Surprisingly, there is a lack of openly available tools and experimental platforms to scrutinize Bluetooth. In particular, system aspects and close to hardware protocol layers are mostly uncovered. We reverse engineer multiple Broadcom Bluetooth chipsets that are widespread in off-the-shelf devices. Thus, we offer deep insights into the internal architecture of a popular commercial family of Bluetooth controllers used in smartphones, wearables, and IoT platforms. Reverse engineered functions can then be altered with our InternalBlue Python framework---outperforming evaluation kits, which are limited to documented and vendor-defined functions. The modified Bluetooth stack remains fully functional and high-performance. Hence, it provides a portable low-cost research platform. InternalBlue is a versatile framework and we demonstrate its abilities by implementing tests and demos for known Bluetooth vulnerabilities. Moreover, we discover a novel critical security issue affecting a large selection of Broadcom chipsets that allows executing code within the attacked Bluetooth firmware. We further show how to use our framework to fix bugs in chipsets out of vendor support and how to add new security features to Bluetooth firmware."
Animal-Borne Anti-Poaching System,"Wildlife poaching is a critical driver of biodiversity loss and population decline. Poaching is a particular threat to high value, large-bodied species, such as elephants, that are slow to reproduce. Increasingly, GPS tracking collars serve as a key tool for studying the behavior and monitoring wildlife globally, including application to anti-poaching efforts. However, collars provide indirect information on poaching, such as immobility, that is often not available in real time. In parallel to collar development, acoustic gunshot detection systems have proliferated in the military and law enforcement. Static systems in wildlife areas have been deployed for detecting poaching, but such systems do not scale geographically. This paper explores the idea of fusing GPS tracking collars with acoustic shockwave detectors to create an animal-borne anti-poaching sensor. A real-time alert of gunshots near elephant groups would enable rangers to respond immediately to such events. The two main technical challenges to such a system are battery life and detection accuracy. The paper presents a prototype designed for elephants that has great promise in addressing these significant technical challenges."
SpecEye: Towards Pervasive and Privacy-Preserving Screen Exposure Detection in Daily Life,"Digital devices have become a necessity in our daily life, with digital screens acting as a gateway to access a plethora of information present in the underlying device. However, these devices emit visible light through screens where long-term use can lead to significant screen exposure, further influencing users' health. Conventional methods on screen exposure detection (\textite.g., photo logger) are usually privacy-invasive and expensive, further, require ideal light conditions, which are unattainable in real practice. Considering the light intensity and spectrum vary among different light sources, an effective screen spectrum estimation can provide vital information about screen exposure. To this end, we first investigate the characteristics of the junction between p-type and n-type semiconductor (i.e., PN junction) to sense the spectrum under various conditions. Empirically, we design and implement, \textsfSpecEye, an end-to-end, low cost, wearable, and privacy-preserving screen exposure detection system with a mobile application. For validating the performance of our system, we conduct comprehensive experiments with $54$ commodity digital screens, at $43$ distinct locations, with results showing a base accuracy of $99$%, and an equal error rate (EER) approaching $0.80$% under the controlled lab setup. Moreover, we assess the reliability, robustness, and performance variation of \textsfSpecEye under various real-world circumstances to observe a stable accuracy of $95$%. Our real-world study indicates \textsfSpecEye is a promising system for screen exposure detection in everyday life."

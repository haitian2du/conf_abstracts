"CloseTalker: Secure, Short-Range Ad Hoc Wireless Communication","Secure communication is difficult to arrange between devices that have not previously shared a secret. Previous solutions to the problem are susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, require additional hardware for out-of-band communication, or require an extensive public-key infrastructure. Furthermore, as the number of wireless devices explodes with the advent of the Internet of Things, it will be impractical to manually configure each device to communicate with its neighbors. Our system, CloseTalker, allows simple, secure, ad hoc communication between devices in close physical proximity, while jamming the signal so it is unintelligible to any receivers more than a few centimeters away. CloseTalker does not require any specialized hardware or sensors in the devices, does not require complex algorithms or cryptography libraries, occurs only when intended by the user, and can transmit a short burst of data or an address and key that can be used to establish long-term or long-range communications at full bandwidth. In this paper we present a theoretical and practical evaluation of CloseTalker, which exploits Wi-Fi MIMO antennas and the fundamental physics of radio to establish secure communication between devices that have never previously met. We demonstrate that CloseTalker is able to facilitate secure in-band communication between devices in close physical proximity (about 5~cm), even though they have never met nor shared a key."
enClosure: Group Communication via Encounter Closures,"New applications enabled by personal smart devices and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) require communication in the context of periods of spatial co-location. Examples of this encounter-based communication (EbC) include social exchange among individuals who shared an experience, and interaction among personal and IoT devices that provide location-based services. Existing EbC systems are limited to communication among participants that share a direct encounter. This paper is inspired by two insights: (1) encounters also enable group communication among devices connected by paths in the encounter graph that is contextual, spontaneous, secure, and does not require users to reveal identifying or linkable information; and (2) addressing communication partners using encounter closures subject to causal, spatial, and temporal constraints enables powerful new forms of group communication. We present the design of enClosure, a service providing group communication based on encounter closures for mobile and IoT applications, and a prototype implementation for Android and the Microsoft Embedded Social Cloud platform. Using real-world traces, we show that enClosure provides a privacy-preserving, secure platform for a wide range of group communication applications ranging from connecting attendees of a large event and virtual guest books to disseminating health risk warnings, lost-and-found, and tracing missing persons."
Are RFID Sensing Systems Ready for the Real World?,"Passive Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags are commonly used to provide Radio Frequency (RF) accessible unique identifiers for physical objects due to their low-cost, lack of battery, and small size. Besides this basic function, many novel RFID-based sensing applications have been proposed in the last decade, including localization, gesture sensing, and touch sensing, among others. Nevertheless, none of these systems are in widespread use today. We hypothesize that this is because the accuracy of these systems does not meet application requirements when there are even minor changes in the RF environment or in tag geometry, i.e., changes in a tag's orientation or flexing. This paper uses both theoretical analysis and real-world experiments to test this hypothesis. Our theoretical analysis shows that even a small phase or RSS noise level can result in significant estimation errors. Our extensive real-world experiments find that both the absolute and differential values of phase and RSS readings of an RFID tag's signal can vary as much as by Ï€ radians and 10 dB, respectively, due to small changes in the tag's orientation or flexing. Because of these large variations, RFID-based application systems relying on the signal phase or RSS cannot meet application requirements, confirming our hypothesis. In addition to this strong negative result, we also present some insights into designing robust RFID systems that are suitable for use in the real world."
Detecting Misplaced RFID Tags on Static Shelved Items,"A smart shelving system can visualize stock data in real time by leveraging item-level RFID tagging so that we can minimize out-of-stock and reduce warehousing and labor costs. The key issue of smart shelving is to locate RFID tags at any time, especially after misplacing tags. The detection of misplaced tags on stationary shelved items is very challenging due to position ambiguity, phase wrapping, device diversity, and phase ambiguity. Using a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation-based prediction and experimental verification, we propose an effective way of detecting misplaced tags, called FINDS, that integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) and Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to make theoretical and measured phases consistent with each other, and observe the phase shifts caused by misplaced tags. FINDS requires neither antenna movement nor external disturbances. We have implemented a prototype of FINDS with 20 tags and evaluated its performance, demonstrating FINDS's accuracy to be higher than 0.92 in the case of 2 stationary antennas."

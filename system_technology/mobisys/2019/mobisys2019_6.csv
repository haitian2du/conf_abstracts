Real-time Arm Skeleton Tracking and Gesture Inference Tolerant to Missing Wearable Sensors,"This paper presents ArmTroi, a wearable system for understanding and analyzing the detailed arm motions of people primarily by using the motion sensors from wrist-worn wearable devices. ArmTroi can achieve real-time 3D arm skeleton tracking and reliable gesture inference tolerant to missing wearable sensors for enabling numerous useful application designs. We have coped with two major challenges through ArmTroi. First, the skeleton of each arm is determined from the locations of the elbow and wrist, whereas a wearable device only senses a single point from the wrist. We find that the potential solution space is huge. This underconstrained nature fundamentally challenges the achievement of accurate and real-time arm skeleton tracking. Second, wearable sensors may not reliably provide sensory data. For example, devices are not worn by the user, yet the learning tools for gesture inference, such as deep learning, typically have static network structures, which require nontrivial network adaptation to match the input's varying availability and ensure reliable gesture inference. We propose effective techniques to address above challenges, and all computations can be conducted on the user's smartphone. ArmTroi is thus a fully lightweight and portable system. We develop a prototype and extensive evaluation shows the efficacy of the ArmTroi design."
Aura: Inside-out Electromagnetic Controller Tracking,"The ability to track handheld controllers in 3D space is critical for interaction with head-mounted displays, such as those used in virtual and augmented reality systems. Today's systems commonly rely on dedicated infrastructure to track the controller or only provide inertial-based rotational tracking, which severely limits the user experience. Optical inside-out systems offer mobility but require line-of-sight and bulky tracking rings, which limit the ubiquity of these devices. In this work, we present Aura, an inside-out electromagnetic 6-DoF tracking system for handheld controllers. The tracking system consists of three coils embedded in a head-mounted display and a set of orthogonal receiver coils embedded in a handheld controller. We propose a novel closed-form and computationally simple tracking approach to reconstruct position and orientation in real time. Our handheld controller is small enough to fit in a pocket and consumes 45 mW of power, allowing it to operate for multiple days on a typical battery. An evaluation study demonstrates that Aura achieves a median tracking error of 5.5 mm and 0.8 degrees in 3D space within arm's reach."
Zero-Effort Cross-Domain Gesture Recognition with Wi-Fi,"Wi-Fi based sensing systems, although sound as being deployed almost everywhere there is Wi-Fi, are still practically difficult to be used without explicit adaptation efforts to new data domains. Various pioneering approaches have been proposed to resolve this contradiction by either translating features between domains or generating domain-independent features at a higher learning level. Still, extra training efforts are necessary in either data collection or model re-training when new data domains appear, limiting their practical usability. To advance cross-domain sensing and achieve fully zero-effort sensing, a domain-independent feature at the lower signal level acts as a key enabler. In this paper, we propose Widar3.0, a Wi-Fi based zero-effort cross-domain gesture recognition system. The key insight of Widar3.0 is to derive and estimate velocity profiles of gestures at the lower signal level, which represent unique kinetic characteristics of gestures and are irrespective of domains. On this basis, we develop a one-fits-all model that requires only one-time training but can adapt to different data domains. We implement this design and conduct comprehensive experiments. The evaluation results show that without re-training and across various domain factors (i.e. environments, locations and orientations of persons), Widar3.0 achieves 92.7% in-domain recognition accuracy and 82.6%-92.4% cross-domain recognition accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Widar3.0 is the first zero-effort cross-domain gesture recognition work via Wi-Fi, a fundamental step towards ubiquitous sensing."
MagTrack: Enabling Safe Driving Monitoring with Wearable Magnetics,"""Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road"" is the central guideline of safe vehicle driving practices. Many advanced driver assistance systems can effectively detect abnormal vehicle motions. However, these systems often leave insufficient time for drivers to respond to complex road situations, especially when the drivers are distracted. To reduce accidents, it is essential to detect whether a driver complies with safe driving guidelines in real time and provide warnings early before any dangerous maneuvers occur. There are vision-based driver distraction monitoring systems which rely on cameras in high-end vehicles, but their performances are heavily constrained by visibility requirements. In this paper, we present MagTrack, a driver monitoring system that is based on tracking magnetic tags worn by the user. With a single smartwatch and two low-cost magnetic accessories: a hand magnetic ring and a head magnetic eyeglasses clip, our system tracks and classifies a driver's bimanual and head movements simultaneously using both analytical and approximation sensing models. Our approach is robust to driver's postures, vehicles, and environmental changes. We demonstrate that a wide range of activities can be detected by our system, including bimanual steering, visual and manual distractions, and lane changes and turns. In extensive road tests with 500+ instances of driving activities and 500+ minutes of road driving with 10 subjects, MagTrack achieves 87% of precision and 90% of recall rate on the detection of unsafe driving activities."

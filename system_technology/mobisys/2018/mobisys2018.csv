SeCloak: ARM Trustzone-based Mobile Peripheral Control,"Reliable on-off control of peripherals on smart devices is a key to security and privacy in many scenarios. Journalists want to reliably turn off radios to protect their sources during investigative reporting. Users wish to ensure cameras and microphones are reliably off during private meetings. In this paper, we present SeCloak, an ARM TrustZone-based solution that ensures reliable on-off control of peripherals even when the platform software is compromised. We design a secure kernel that co-exists with software running on mobile devices (e.g., Android and Linux) without requiring any code modifications. An Android prototype demonstrates that mobile peripherals like radios, cameras, and microphones can be controlled reliably with a very small trusted computing base and with minimal performance overhead."
TruZ-Droid: Integrating TrustZone with Mobile Operating System,"Mobile devices today provide a hardware-protected mode called Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to help protect users from a compromised OS and hypervisor. Today TEE can only be leveraged either by vendor apps or by developers who work with the vendor. Since vendors consider third-party app code untrusted inside the TEE, to allow an app to leverage TEE, app developers have to write the app code in a tailored way to work with the vendor's SDK. We proposed a novel design to integrate TEE with mobile OS to allow any app to leverage the TEE. Our design incorporates TEE support at the OS level, allowing apps to leverage the TEE without adding app-specific code into the TEE, and while using existing interface to interact with the mobile OS. We implemented our design, called TruZ-Droid, by integrating TrustZone TEE with the Android OS. TruZ-Droid allows apps to leverage the TEE to protect the following: (i) user's secret input and confirmation, and (ii) sending of user's secrets to the authorized server. We built a prototype using the TrustZone-enabled HiKey board to evaluate our design. We demonstrated TruZ-Droid's effectiveness by adding new security features to existing apps to protect user's sensitive information and attest user's confirmation. TruZ-Droid's real-world use case evaluation shows that apps can leverage TrustZone while using existing OS APIs. Our usability study proves that users can correctly interact with TruZ-Droid to protect their security sensitive activities and data."
VButton: Practical Attestation of User-driven Operations in Mobile Apps,"More and more malicious apps and mobile rootkits are found to perform sensitive operations on behalf of legitimate users without their awareness. Malware does so by either forging user inputs or tricking users into making unintended requests to online service providers. Such malware is hard to detect and generates large revenues for cybercriminals, which is often used for committing ad/click frauds, faking reviews/ratings, promoting people or business on social networks, etc."
Augmented Reality-based Mimicry Attacks on Behaviour-Based Smartphone Authentication,"We develop an augmented reality-based app that resides on the attacker's smartphone and leverages computer vision and raw input data to provide real-time mimicry attack guidance on the victim's phone. Our approach does not require tampering or installing software on the victim's device, or specialized hardware. The app is demonstrated by attacking keystroke dynamics, a method leveraging the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them on a smartphone, which was previously thought to be hard to mimic. In addition, we propose a low-tech AR-like audiovisual method based on spatial pointers on a transparent film and audio cues. We conduct experiments with 31 participants and mount over 400 attacks to show that our methods enable attackers to successfully bypass keystroke dynamics for 87% of the attacks after an average mimicry training of four minutes. Our AR-based method can be extended to attack other input behaviour-based biometrics. While the particular attack we describe is relatively narrow, it is a good example of using AR guidance to enable successful mimicry of user behaviour---an approach of increasing concern as AR functionality becomes more commonplace."
"My Being to Your Place, Your Being to My Place: Co-present Robotic Avatars Create Illusion of Living Together","People in work-separated families have been heavily relying on cutting-edge face-to-face communication services. Despite their ease of use and ubiquitous availability, experiences in living together are still far incomparable to those through remote face-to-face communication. We envision that enabling a remote person to be spatially superposed in one's living space would be a breakthrough to catalyze pseudo living-together interactivity. We propose HomeMeld, a zero-hassle self-mobile robotic system serving as a co-present avatar to create a persistent illusion of living together for those who are involuntarily living apart. The key challenges are 1) continuous spatial mapping between two heterogeneous floor plans and 2) navigating the robotic avatar to reflect the other's presence in real time under the limited maneuverability of the robot. We devise a notion of functionally equivalent location and orientation to translate a person's presence into another in a heterogeneous floor plan. We also develop predictive path warping to seamlessly synchronize the presence of the other. We conducted extensive experiments and deployment studies with real participants."
Cutting the Cord: Designing a High-quality Untethered VR System with Low Latency Remote Rendering,"This paper introduces an end-to-end untethered VR system design and open platform that can meet virtual reality latency and quality requirements at 4K resolution over a wireless link. High-quality VR systems generate graphics data at a data rate much higher than those supported by existing wireless-communication products such as Wi-Fi and 60GHz wireless communication. The necessary image encoding, makes it challenging to maintain the stringent VR latency requirements. To achieve the required latency, our system employs a Parallel Rendering and Streaming mechanism to reduce the add-on streaming latency, by pipelining the rendering, encoding, transmission and decoding procedures. Furthermore, we introduce a Remote VSync Driven Rendering technique to minimize display latency. To evaluate the system, we implement an end-to-end remote rendering platform on commodity hardware over a 60Ghz wireless network. Results show that the system can support current 2160x1200 VR resolution at 90Hz with less than 16ms end-to-end latency, and 4K resolution with 20ms latency, while keeping a visually lossless image quality to the user."
AVR: Augmented Vehicular Reality,"Autonomous vehicle prototypes today come with line-of-sight depth perception sensors like 3D cameras. These 3D sensors are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, not just for autonomous vehicles but for other Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to wirelessly share visual information with other nearby vehicles, but requires the design of novel relative positioning techniques, new perspective transformation methods, approaches to isolate and predict the motion of dynamic objects in order to hide latency, and adaptive transmission strategies to cope with wireless bandwidth variability. We show that AVR is feasible using off-the-shelf wireless technologies, and it can qualitatively change the decisions made by autonomous vehicle path planning algorithms. Our AVR prototype achieves positioning accuracies that are within a few percent of car lengths and lane widths, and is optimized to process frames at 30fps."
Kite: Building Conversational Bots from Mobile Apps,"Task-oriented chatbots allow users to carry out tasks (e.g., ordering a pizza) using natural language conversation. The widely-used slot-filling approach for building bots of this type requires significant hand-coding, which hinders scalability. Recently, neural network models have been shown to be capable of generating natural ""chitchat"" conversations, but it is unclear whether they will ever work for task modeling. Kite is a practical system for bootstrapping task-oriented bots, leveraging both approaches above. Kite's key insight is that while bots encapsulate the logic of user tasks into conversational forms, existing apps encapsulate the logic of user tasks into graphical user interfaces. A developer demonstrates a task using a relevant app, and from the collected interaction traces Kite automatically derives a task model, a graph of actions and associated inputs representing possible task execution paths. A task model represents the logical backbone of a bot, on which Kite layers a question-answer interface generated using a hybrid rule-based and neural network approach. Using Kite, developers can automatically generate bot templates for many different tasks. In our evaluation, it extracted accurate task models from 25 popular Android apps spanning 15 tasks. Appropriate questions and high-quality answers were also generated. Our developer study suggests that developers, even without any bot developing experience, can successfully generate bot templates using Kite."
RuntimeDroid: Restarting-Free Runtime Change Handling for Android Apps,"Portable devices, like smartphones and tablets, are often subject to runtime configuration changes, such as screen orientation changes, screen resizing, keyboard attachments, and language switching. When handled improperly, such simple changes can cause serious runtime issues, from data loss to app crashes."
Empath-D: VR-based Empathetic App Design for Accessibility,"With app-based interaction increasingly permeating all aspects of daily living, it is essential to ensure that apps are designed to be inclusive and are usable by a wider audience such as the elderly, with various impairments (e.g., visual, audio and motor). We propose Empath-D, a system that fosters empathetic design, by allowing app designers, in-situ, to rapidly evaluate the usability of their apps, from the perspective of impaired users. To provide a truly authentic experience, Empath-D carefully orchestrates the interaction between a smartphone and a VR device, allowing the user to experience simulated impairments in a virtual world while interacting naturally with the app, using a real smartphone. By carefully orchestrating the VR-smartphone interaction, Empath-D tackles challenges such as preserving low-latency app interaction, accurate visualization of hand movement and low-overhead perturbation of I/O streams. Experimental results show that user interaction with Empath-D is comparable (both in accuracy and user perception) to real-world app usage, and that it can simulate impairment effects as effectively as a custom hardware simulator."
Sonoloc: Scalable positioning of commodity mobile devices,"We present Sonoloc, a mobile app and system that allows a set of co-located commodity smart devices to determine their relative positions without local infrastructure. Sonoloc enables users to address each other based on their relative positions at events like meetings, talks, or conferences. This capability can, for instance, aid spontaneous communication among users based on their relative position (e.g., in a given section of a room, at the same table, or in a given seat), facilitate interaction between speaker and audience in a lecture hall, and enable the distribution of materials, crowdsensing, and feedback collection based on users' location. Sonoloc can position any number of devices within acoustic range with a constant number of chirps emitted by a self-organized subset of devices. Our experimental evaluation shows that the system can locate up to hundreds of devices with an accuracy of tens of centimeters using up to 15 audio chirps emitted by dynamically selected devices, in actual rooms and despite substantial background noise."
BikeGPS: Accurate Localization of Shared Bikes in Street Canyons via Low-Level GPS Cooperation,"The past few years have seen a surge of stationless bike sharing services in many modern cities. The service allows the bikes to be dropped off freely, and to be found through GPS localization. For maximum convenience, the bikes are often parked in close proximity to the buildings, where GPS may perform poorly, making bike search a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to addressing this problem. Inspired by multi-antenna systems, our method tries to collect GPS signals from multiple distributed bikes, by organizing a group of bikes into a network, called the BikeGPS. Formed by pedestrian users who opportunistically measure interbike distance via radio sensing and step tracking, the generated network permits one to map all the nodes' satellite range measurements into a single lead node's view. By considering both signal and geometry properties of satellite raw measurements, and using an asynchronous coarse time navigation algorithm, the lead node can accurately derive the locations of all the network nodes. Real-world experiments show that BikeGPS significantly improves the localization performance, in terms of both accuracy and solution availability, compared with the naive GPS approach and a high-level cooperative localization method."
Gnome: A Practical Approach to NLOS Mitigation for GPS Positioning in Smartphones,"Accurate positioning in urban areas is important for personal navigation, geolocation apps, and ride-sharing. Smartphones localize themselves using GPS position estimates, and augment these with a variety of techniques including dead reckoning, map matching, and WiFi localization. However, GPS signals suffer significant impairment in urban canyons because of limited line-of-sight to satellites and signal reflections. In this paper, we focus on scalable and deployable techniques to reduce the impact of one specific impairment: reflected GPS signals from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) satellites. Specifically, we show how, using publicly available street-level imagery and off-the-shelf computer vision techniques, we can estimate the path inflation incurred by (the extra distance traveled by) a reflected signal from a satellite. Using these path inflation estimates we develop techniques to estimate the most likely actual position given a set of satellite readings at some position. Finally, we develop optimizations for fast position estimation on modern smartphones. Using extensive experiments in the downtown area of several large cities, we find that our techniques can reduce positioning error by up to 55% on average."
Explicit Channel Coordination via Cross-technology Communication,"Under significant coexistence in the ISM band, the impact of cross-technology interference (CTI) has become a major threat to low-power IoT. This paper presents ECC that uniquely enables explicit channel coordination among heterogeneities via cross-technology communication (CTC) introduced in the latest studies, while maintaining full compatibility to commodity devices. Unlike any implicit coordination designs adopting statistical models to probabilistically predict white spaces, ECC generates the white space using WiFi CTS, which is then explicitly notified to ZigBee through CTC for immediate use. Technical highlight of ECC lies in ensuring ZigBee communication under CTI, without disrupting WiFi operation. This is effectively achieved by the dynamic adjustment of CTS duration with respect to traffic amount and spectrum availability, which essentially enables ECC to be generally applied to various scenarios without prior knowledge. Lastly, ECC significantly reduces delay and energy in low duty cycled ZigBee, by waking them up upon channel availability (via CTC). We evaluate ECC on commercial platforms: Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and TelosB motes. Experiment results show that ECC achieves 1.8x ZigBee packet reception ratio, and cuts down delay and energy by 98.6% and 51% under the low duty cycle."
Spatial Stream Backscatter Using Commodity WiFi,"Backscatter WiFi offers a novel low-cost and low-energy solution for RFID tags to communicate with existing WiFi devices. State-of-the-art backscatter WiFi solutions have seldom explored advanced features in the latest WiFi standards, in particular, spatial multiplexing, which has been the cornerstone for 802.11n and beyond. In this paper, we present MOXcatter, a WiFi backscatter communication system that works with spatial streams using commodity radios, while keeping the ongoing data communication unaffected. In MOXcatter, a backscatter tag can embed its sensing data on ambient spatial-stream packets, and both the sensing data and the original packets can be decoded by commodity WiFi devices. We have built a MOXcatter prototype with FPGAs and commodity WiFi devices. The experiments show that MOXcatter achieves up to 50 Kbps throughput for a single stream and up to 1 Kbps for double streams with a communication range (tag-to-RX) up to 14 m. We discuss the tradeoffs therein and possible enhancements, and also showcase the applicability of our design through a sensor communication system."
Chiron: Concurrent High Throughput Communication for IoT Devices,"The exponentially increasing number of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices motivate us to explore more efficient and higher throughput communication, especially at the bottleneck (i.e., edge) of the IoT networks. Our work, named Chiron, opens a promising direction for Physical (PHY) layer concurrent high throughput communication to heterogeneous IoT devices (e.g., wider-band WiFi and narrower-band ZigBee). Specifically, at the PHY layer, Chiron enables concurrently transmitting (or receiving) 1 stream of WiFi data and up to 4 streams of ZigBee data to (or from) commodity WiFi and ZigBee devices as if there is no interference between these simultaneous connections. We extensively evaluate our system under different real-world settings. Results show that Chiron's concurrent WiFi and ZigBee communication can achieve similar throughput as the sole WiFi or ZigBee communication. Chiron's spectrum utilization is more than 16 times better than the traditional gateway."
CoReCast: Collision Resilient Broadcasting in Vehicular Networks,"Reliable and timely delivery of periodic V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) broadcast messages is essential for realizing the benefits of connected vehicles. Existing MAC protocols for ad hoc networks fall short of meeting these requirements. In this paper, we present, CoReCast, the first collision embracing protocol for vehicular networks. CoReCast provides high reliability and low delay by leveraging two unique opportunities: no strict constraint on energy consumption, and availability of GPS clocks to achieve near-perfect time and frequency synchronization."
SandTrap: Tracking Information Flows On Demand with Parallel Permissions,"The most promising way to improve the performance of dynamic information-flow tracking (DIFT) for machine code is to only track instructions when they process tainted data. Unfortunately, prior approaches to on-demand DIFT are a poor match for modern mobile platforms that rely heavily on parallelism to provide good interactivity in the face of computationally intensive tasks like image processing. The main shortcoming of these prior efforts is that they cannot support an arbitrary mix of parallel threads due to the limitations of page protections."
Detecting Wireless Spy Cameras Via Stimulating and Probing,"The rapid proliferation of wireless video cameras has raised serious privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a stimulating-and-probing approach to detecting wireless spy cameras. The core idea is to actively alter the light condition of a private space to manipulate the spy camera's video scene, and then investigates the responsive variations of a packet flow to determine if it is produced by a wireless camera. Following this approach, we develop Blink and Flicker -- two practical systems for detecting wireless spy cameras. Blink is a lightweight app that can be deployed on off-the-shelf mobile devices. It asks the user to turn on/off the light of her private space, and then uses the light sensor and the wireless radio of the mobile device to identify the response of wireless cameras. Flicker is a robust and automated system that augments Blink to detect wireless cameras in both live and offline streaming modes. Flicker employs a cheap and portable circuit, which harnesses daily used LEDs to stimulate wireless cameras using human-invisible flickering. The time series of stimuli is further encoded using FEC to combat ambient light and uncontrollable packet flow variations that may degrade detection performance. Extensive experiments show that Blink and Flicker can accurately detect wireless cameras under a wide range of network and environmental conditions."
Shadow Wi-Fi: Teaching Smartphones to Transmit Raw Signals and to Extract Channel State Information to Implement Practical Covert Channels over Wi-Fi,"Wi-Fi chips offer vast capabilities, which are not accessible through the manufacturers' official firmwares. Unleashing those capabilities can enable innovative applications on off-the-shelf devices. In this work, we demonstrate how to transmit raw IQ samples from a large buffer on Wi-Fi chips. We further show how to extract channel state information (CSI) on a per frame basis. As a proof-of-concept application, we build a covert channel on top of Wi-Fi to stealthily exchange information between two devices by prefiltering Wi-Fi frames prior to transmission. On the receiver side, the CSI is used to extract the embedded information. By means of experimentation, we show that regular Wi-Fi clients can still demodulate the underlying Wi-Fi frames. Our results show that covert channels on the physical layer are practical and run on off-the-shelf smartphones. By making available our raw signal transmitter, the CSI extractor, and the covert channel application to the research community, we ensure reproducibility and offer a platform for further innovative applications on Wi-Fi devices."
TYTH-Typing On Your Teeth: Tongue-Teeth Localization for Human-Computer Interface,"This paper explores a new wearable system, called TYTH, that enables a novel form of human computer interaction based on the relative location and interaction between the user's tongue and teeth. TYTH allows its user to interact with a computing system by tapping on their teeth. This form of interaction is analogous to using a finger to type on a keypad except that the tongue substitutes for the finger and the teeth for the keyboard. We study the neurological and anatomical structures of the tongue to design TYTH so that the obtrusiveness and social awkwardness caused by the wearable is minimized while maximizing its accuracy and sensing sensitivity. From behind the user's ears, TYTH senses the brain signals and muscle signals that control tongue movement sent from the brain and captures the miniature skin surface deformation caused by tongue movement. We model the relationship between tongue movement and the signals recorded, from which a tongue localization technique and tongue-teeth tapping detection technique are derived. Through a prototyping implementation and an evaluation with 15 subjects, we show that TYTH can be used as a form of hands-free human computer interaction with 88.61% detection rate and promising adoption rate by users."
Depth Aware Finger Tapping on Virtual Displays,"For AR/VR systems, tapping-in-the-air is a user-friendly solution for interactions. Most prior in-air tapping schemes use customized depth-cameras and therefore have the limitations of low accuracy and high latency. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained depth-aware tapping scheme that can provide high accuracy tapping detection. Our basic idea is to use light-weight ultrasound based sensing, along with one COTS mono-camera, to enable 3D tracking of user's fingers. The mono-camera is used to track user's fingers in the 2D space and ultrasound based sensing is used to get the depth information of user's fingers in the 3D space. Using speakers and microphones that already exist on most AR/VR devices, we emit ultrasound, which is inaudible to humans, and capture the signal reflected by the finger with the microphone. From the phase changes of the ultrasound signal, we accurately measure small finger movements in the depth direction. With fast and light-weight ultrasound signal processing algorithms, our scheme can accurately track finger movements and measure the bending angle of the finger between two video frames. In our experiments on eight users, our scheme achieves a 98.4% finger tapping detection accuracy with FPR of 1.6% and FNR of 1.4%, and a detection latency of 17.69ms, which is 57.7ms less than video-only schemes. The power consumption overhead of our scheme is 48.4% more than video-only schemes."
Brain Password: A Secure and Truly Cancelable Brain Biometrics for Smart Headwear,"In recent years, biometric techniques (e.g., fingerprint or iris) are increasingly integrated into mobile devices to offer security advantages over traditional practices (e.g., passwords and PINs) due to their ease of use in user authentication. However, existing biometric systems are with controversy: once divulged, they are compromised forever - no one can grow a new fingerprint or iris. This work explores a truly cancelable brain-based biometric system for mobile platforms (e.g., smart headwear). Specifically, we present a new psychophysiological protocol via non-volitional brain response for trustworthy mobile authentication, with an application example of smart headwear. Particularly, we address the following research challenges in mobile biometrics with a theoretical and empirical combined manner: (1) how to generate reliable brain responses with sophisticated visual stimuli; (2) how to acquire the distinct brain response and analyze unique features in the mobile platform; (3) how to reset and change brain biometrics when the current biometric credential is divulged. To evaluate the proposed solution, we conducted a pilot study and achieved an f -score accuracy of 95.46% and equal error rate (EER) of 2.503%, thereby demonstrating the potential feasibility of neurofeedback based biometrics for smart headwear. Furthermore, we perform the cancelability study and the longitudinal study, respectively, to show the effectiveness and usability of our new proposed mobile biometric system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first in-depth research study on truly cancelable brain biometrics for secure mobile authentication."
MicroMobile: Leveraging Mobile Advertising for Large-Scale Experimentation,"Mobile systems researchers struggle with conducting experiments with real users: either the scale of the study lacks sufficient scale and diversity, or a great effort must be used to recruit and manage subjects. In this paper, we describe MicroMobile, a system for deploying short data-gathering experiments to an extremely diverse set of users via mobile advertising. We conduct experiments in three mediums: interactive advertisements, mobile browsers, and native applications on both major mobile operating systems."
TAR: Enabling Fine-Grained Targeted Advertising in Retail Stores,"Mobile advertisements influence customers' in-store purchases and boost in-store sales for brick-and-mortar retailers. Targeting mobile ads has become significantly important to compete with online shopping. The key to enabling targeted mobile advertisement and service is to learn shoppers' interest during their stay in the store. Precise shopper tracking and identification are essential to gain the insights. However, existing sensor-based or vision-based solutions are neither practical nor accurate; no commercial solutions today can be readily deployed in a large store. On the other hand, we recognize that most retail stores have the installation of surveillance cameras, and most shoppers carry Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. Thus, in this paper, we propose TAR to learn shoppers' in-store interest via accurate multi-camera people tracking and identification. TAR leverages widespread camera deployment and Bluetooth proximity information to accurately track and identify shoppers in the store. TAR is composed of four novel design components: (1) a deep neural network (DNN) based visual tracking, (2) a user trajectory estimation by using shopper visual and BLE proximity trace, (3) an identity matching and assignment to recognize shopper's identity, and (4) a cross-camera calibration algorithm. TAR carefully combines these components to track and identify shoppers in real-time. TAR achieves 90% accuracy in two different real-life deployments, which is 20% better than the state-of-the-art solution."
CrowdEstimator: Approximating Crowd Sizes with Multi-modal Data for Internet-of-Things Services,"Crowd mobility has been paid attention for the Internet-of-things (IoT) applications. This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an IoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The crowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area using the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi probe request packets (""Wi-Fi probes"" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices to solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd size may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental uncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation. Moreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals is time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors, stereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified calibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the crowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd estimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities. Then, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different stakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To verify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the Wellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch Re:START Mall in New Zealand. The large-scale pilot studies show that stereoscopic cameras can reach minimum accuracy of 85% and high precision detection for providing the near ground-truth. The proposed calibration algorithms reduce estimation errors by 43.68% on average compared to the Wi-Fi-only approach."
Widar2.0: Passive Human Tracking with a Single Wi-Fi Link,"This paper presents Widar2.0, the first WiFi-based system that enables passive human localization and tracking using a single link on commodity off-the-shelf devices. Previous works based on either specialized or commercial hardware all require multiple links, preventing their wide adoption in scenarios like homes where typically only one single AP is installed. The key insight underlying Widar2.0 to circumvent the use of multiple links is to leverage multi-dimensional signal parameters from one single link. To this end, we build a unified model accounting for Angle-of-Arrival, Time-of-Flight, and Doppler shifts together and devise an efficient algorithm for their joint estimation. We then design a pipeline to translate the erroneous raw parameters into precise locations, which first finds parameters corresponding to the reflections of interests, then refines range estimates, and ultimately outputs target locations. Our implementation and evaluation on commodity WiFi devices demonstrate that Widar2.0 achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art localization systems, which either use specialized hardwares or require 2 to 40 Wi-Fi links."
Augmenting Indoor Inertial Tracking with Polarized Light,"Inertial measurement unit (IMU) has long suffered from the problem of integration drift, where sensor noises accumulate quickly and cause fast-growing tracking errors. Existing methods for calibrating IMU tracking either require human in the loop, or need energy-consuming cameras, or suffer from coarse tracking granularity. We propose to augment indoor inertial tracking by reusing existing indoor luminaries to project a static light polarization pattern in the space. This pattern is imperceptible to human eyes and yet through a polarizer, it becomes detectable by a color sensor, and thus can serve as fine-grained optical landmarks that constrain and correct IMU's integration drift and boost tracking accuracy. Exploiting the birefringence optical property of transparent tapes -- a low-cost and easily-accessible material -- we realize the polarization pattern by simply adding to existing light cover a thin polarizer film with transparent tape stripes glued atop. When fusing with IMU sensor signals, the light pattern enables robust, accurate and low-power motion tracking. Meanwhile, our approach entails low deployment overhead by reusing existing lighting infrastructure without needing an active modulation unit. We build a prototype of our light cover and the sensing unit using off-the-shelf components. Experiments show 4.3 cm median error for 2D tracking and 10 cm for 3D tracking, as well as its robustness in diverse settings."
Multipath Triangulation: Decimeter-level WiFi Localization and Orientation with a Single Unaided Receiver,"Decimeter-level localization has become a reality, in part due to the ability to eliminate the effects of multipath interference. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to use multipath reflections to enhance localization rather than throwing them away. We present Multipath Triangulation, a new localization technique that uses multipath reflections to localize a target device with a single receiver that does not require any form of coordination with any other devices. In this paper, we leverage multipath triangulation to build the first decimeter-level WiFi localization system, called MonoLoco, that requires only a single access point (AP) and a single channel, and does not impose any overhead, data sharing, or coordination protocols beyond standard WiFi communication. As a bonus, it also determines the orientation of the target relative to the AP. We implemented MonoLoco using Intel 5300 commodity WiFi cards and deploy it in four environments with different multipath propagation. Results indicate median localization error of 0.5m and median orientation error of 6.6 degrees, which are comparable to the best performing prior systems, all of which require multiple APs and/or multiple frequency channels. High accuracy can be achieved with only a handful of packets."
On-Demand Deep Model Compression for Mobile Devices: A Usage-Driven Model Selection Framework,"Recent research has demonstrated the potential of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile platforms by trimming down the network complexity using different compression techniques. The current practice only investigate stand-alone compression schemes even though each compression technique may be well suited only for certain types of DNN layers. Also, these compression techniques are optimized merely for the inference accuracy of DNNs, without explicitly considering other application-driven system performance (e.g. latency and energy cost) and the varying resource availabilities across platforms (e.g. storage and processing capability). In this paper, we explore the desirable tradeoff between performance and resource constraints by user-specified needs, from a holistic system-level viewpoint. Specifically, we develop a usage-driven selection framework, referred to as AdaDeep, to automatically select a combination of compression techniques for a given DNN, that will lead to an optimal balance between user-specified performance goals and resource constraints. With an extensive evaluation on five public datasets and across twelve mobile devices, experimental results show that AdaDeep enables up to 9.8x latency reduction, 4.3x energy efficiency improvement, and 38x storage reduction in DNNs while incurring negligible accuracy loss. AdaDeep also uncovers multiple effective combinations of compression techniques unexplored in existing literature."

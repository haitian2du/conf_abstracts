Poster: Sdguard: An Android Application Implementing Privacy Protection and Ransomware Detection,"Currently, the smartphone has become an essential communication and amusement tool, which has strong computing power and a variety of functions. Especially, the market share of smartphone with android system account for 84% in 2016[1]. Under android system, a large of privacy data (e.g. photos or videos) are stored in external storage (emulated Sdcard storage), which can be accessed by installed apps. This not only results in privacy leakage but also incurs ransomware attack[2] (e.g. simplocker). Therefore, we present Sdguard, an app, can implement fine-grain permission control based on Linux DAC mechanism and detect ransomware which encrypts content of file stored in external storage or lock user screen. To install Sdguard app, we need to ensure that the smartphone has been rooted and use FUSE filesystem on external storage. During installing, sdcard daemon of android (i.e. FUSE daemon) is replaced by our customized sdcard daemon. After rebooting system, the customized daemon is loaded, and each component of Sdguard is running."
Poster: MobiTemplate: A Template-based Rapid Cross-Platform Mobile Application Development Environment,"Customizable mobile services are usually expressed with complex services composed of different atomic services. Fine-grained atomic mobile services are not so convenient for end users to reuse. Considering that in identical or similar service domains, a great deal of the business logics and functions are reusable within the scope. So we present a template-based framework to allow reuse of services and to achieve rapid mobile application development. The reusable fine-grained service logics and functions are encapsulated into comparatively coarse-grained templates, from which the designers can create the personalized composite services and edit the templates efficiently."
Poster: Mobile Power Management Using FreeRTOS-based Uninterruptable Generator Supply,"Current designs of battery-powered uninterruptible power supplies only provide power for a short time, and offer few control options. We combined a compact synchronous generator with a battery with 10% of the capacity of a UPS of the same rating to produce an uninterruptible generator supply (UGS). The controller of this UGS runs FreeRTOS, which enables it to respond quickly to a power outage. A wifi module provides connectivity to a web server for real-time monitoring and management on a remote PC or cellphone."
Poster: Charge My Phone As I Instruct,"Charging mobile devices fast alleviates users' impatience in waiting for their devices to be charged. So, fast charging has been the focus of both industry and academia, developing and deploying various technologies, such as Quick Charge by Qualcomm, TurboPower by Motorola, Flash Charge by OPPO, etc. Fast charging, unfortunately, accelerates the capacity fading of device battery because it follows the Constant Current, Constant Voltage (CCCV) charge principle without considering the behavior of how users charge their devices. CCCV charging principle is a two-phase charging process consisting of (i) Constant-Current Charge (CC-Chg) and (ii) Constant-Voltage Charge (CV-Chg) [2] where CV-Chg is usually triggered at the end of charging (e.g., 80-100%) to stabilize the battery condition. However, fast charging technologies are agnostic of users' available charging time, resulting in premature termination of the planned charging if users only have limited time. This, in turn, leads to an incomplete CV-Chg phase or even skipping it completely. From our empirical measurements, we discovered that CV-Chg relaxes the batteries and slows down their capacity fading by up to 80% [1] incomplete CV-Chg shortens the battery life significantly over time!"
Poster: Docker-Based Self-Organizing IoT Services Architecture for Smarthome,"Internet of Things(IoT) was first coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton. However with the technologies advancement, it seems that intelligent devices will invisibly be embedded in our life in few years. Enormous amounts of data need be exchanged every seconds. It calls for a seamless effect and easily interpretable communicating architecture. The research proposal will try to address some challenges and possible path in IoT enabled smarthome. It focuses primarily on two categories. Firstly, devices in IoT field is always distributed. So, there is a distributed IoT services architecture instead of traditional control-center solution. However, those devices are also limited in a certain area (such as a home local network). In order to reduce delay and burden, those distributed devices collect context information though a self-organizing broadcast network, and determine their next action based on that context data. Secondly, using Docker (a lightweight hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic container) to package services. In our smarthome network, IoT services are distributed across different home electronics. Docker shields all the differences, so that we can quickly deploy and update module in the smarthome network after purchasing new electronics."
Poster: Improve Push Notification on Smartwatches,"Receiving push notifications is one of the key features of smartwatches. In our recent measurement study involving 27 smartwatch users [1], we found that push notifications are used by more than 200 applications, dominated by instant messaging, emails, social media, etc. In this work, we propose a suite of methods to optimize the performance, energy efficiency, and usability of smartwatch push notifications, which have several salient features distinguishing them from regular notifications received on a smartphone: requiring heavy phonewatch cooperation, being delivered over short-range Bluetooth link, and incurring non-trivial energy consumption on watches with very limited battery capacity. Considering these factors, our proposed work focuses on four aspects as elaborated."

Poster: Towards Quick Angular Check to Rebuff Forged Position Attacks in Vehicular Communication,"Although Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) will be legally enforced from 2020 after the recent move by the U.S. Government [1], there is still an unresolved security issue. It is data plausibility, which is not addressed in any standard that comprises the WAVE framework. In particular, an attacker may forge false position values in safety beacons in order to cause unsafe response from startled receiving vehicles. The data plausibility is a longstanding issue for which various approaches based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis and communication constraints have been proposed. However, none of these completely solve the problem."
Poster: Visual Cue-Based VRU Protection on Smartphones,"As autonomous vehicles loom as reality, and the vehicle communication starts to be enforced by law from 2020, protecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) using vehicle communication is receiving attention. The current vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication as stipulated by the standards such as SAE J2735 implies that it is the vehicles that take the responsibility for VRU protection. User devices are essentially beacons that transmit Personal Safety Messages (PSMs), and upon receiving PSMs, the drivers (or autonomous vehicles) take necessary measures to protect them. We, however, believe that the road users also need information about nearby vehicles to protect themselves from dangerous situations. Using other technologies than the standard Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), there have been existing works for VRU protection. They use Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi Direct as replacements of DSRC. An automaker tested DSRC for VRU protection, but no technical detail has been presented. An important issue with the existing VRU protection proposals is that they are fraught with false alarms, which lowers the utility of the whole idea. Although one can come up with a highly precise collision prediction model, any such model will generate a huge number of false alarms, especially in urban environments. For example, if a pedestrian walks along a sidewalk well protected from the driveway, all passing vehicles will generate an alert to the pedestrian and vice versa. So our approach instead provides intuitive visual cues to the smartphone user looking at the screen, so that they can use their discretion to determine the level of danger for themselves."
Poster: A Lightweight Live Migration Platform with Container-based Virtualization for System Resilience,"When integrated with push notifications, a live migration function can be used to ensure that systems have a high reliability in cases of hardware failures. However, the dependencies for a large range of hardware devices need to be addressed before realizing emergency live migration. Our platform introduces container-based light virtualization and an automated build function to isolate an application so that it can be deployed on different devices such as Edison, Raspberry Pi model B, BeagleBone Black, and Odroid XU3."
Poster: Application-Layer Optimization of Performance vs Energy in Mobile Network I/O,"The number of smartphone users globally has already exceeded 2 Billion, and this number is expected to reach 3 Billion by 2020 [2]. It is also estimated that smartphone mobile data traffic (cellular + WiFi) will reach 370 Exabytes per year by that time, exceeding PC Internet traffic the first time in the history [4]."
Poster: Vocal Resonance as a Passive Biometric,"With continuing advances in the development of low-power electronics, including sensors and actuators, we anticipate a rapid expansion of pervasive computing. Wearable devices, in particular, require new modes for interaction -- many have no keyboard or touchscreen. In this work, we focus on user authentication on wearable devices. For an entertainment device, such as a VR headset, it can recognize the user and load the right game profile or music playlist. For a house climate-control system, it can adjust the environment to the wearer's preference. Most compellingly, for a health-monitoring device, it can label the sensor data with the correct identity so that the data can be stored in the correct health record. (A mix-up of sensor data could lead to incorrect decisions, with harm to the patient.) Because not all devices are personal devices -- my phone, your fitness sensor -- many devices will need to automatically recognize their wearer. They may have no interface for user identification (or PIN or password for authentication). Thus, we need a simple, wearable biometric technique to identify the user -- which could be embedded in one authentication device that shares the identity with a body-area network of other devices (earlier confirmed to be on the same body). This device should be trained once, for each user that might wear it, but thenceforth be completely automatic. Although a wristband could use a physiological biometric to recognize its wearer; we seek an alternative biometric, notably, one that might work for devices mounted on the head, neck, or chest."
Poster: Occupancy State Detection using WiFi Signals,"A large amount of energy could be saved by detecting home occupancy and automatically controlling the lights, HVAC, water heating, and other mechanical systems. Existing systems rely on motion information, which usually fail to detect occupied rooms with stationary people. In this project, we study the possibility of converting commodity WiFi access points to occupancy sensors by exploiting multipath reflections as individual spatial sensors. The proposed method measures fine-grained distortions caused by human body on phase and amplitude of WiFi signals. Our initial results suggest that formulating WiFi parameters into angle of arrival provides a more sensitive metric to measure occupancy."
Poster: Smartwatch Knows How Much You Drink,"Water accounts for about 60% of the human body, and when the body loses it (e.g., through urine, sweat, etc.) in higher rate than its intake rate (through drinking), dehydration symptoms occur. The dehydration causes many severe health problems like organ and cognitive impairment. Therefore, it is critical for the human to drink water in a sustained manner to avoid dehydration. To prevent humans from dehydration, continuous day-scale tracking of the water intake is needed. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive method to recognize the drinking activity as well as estimate the water intake amount in milliliter scale by leveraging smartwatches. Our basic idea is to track the arm motion and discriminate the drinking activities from the similar hand-based motions like food intake, phone calls, etc. Thereafter, we estimate the water intake amount from the drinking duration."
Poster: EPS: Edge-hosted Personal Services for Mobile Users,"Being powered by battery and the reliance on expensive cellular data while users are on the move are holding smart mobile devices from being widely used in those long-lasted, computation-intensive, or highly network-reliant usage scenarios. In the meantime, more and more mobile workloads and optimizations now rely on the cloud, such as mobile cloud offloading, cloud-based mobile web optimization, and cloud-based network traffic redundancy reduction. However, it is hard to perform large-scale and personalized support or optimization for mobile workloads without significant computation resource increase on the cloud, as well as higher bandwidth requirement on the networks. We target solving the above two problems by enabling edge-hosed personalized services (EPS for short). The idea of EPS is twofold. One is enabling developer-customizable and power-and-traffic-efficient network communication on the ""last-hop"" communication between mobile devices and the network edge. The other is distributing cloud services for mobile workloads to network edge, so that they can be done on a personalized basis, while enjoying much lower communication latency to/from mobile devices."
Poster: HeartFit: An Intuitive Smartphone Application for Well-being of Hypertensive Patients,"Hypertension is the single most significant risk factor for heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. The key causes of hypertension can be directly linked to the lifestyle of the patient, including age, family history, smoking, obesity etc. Our work consists of an interactive mobile application that acquires these lifestyle information and use several recommendation techniques to warn and guide the user towards well-being. So far, this is one of the earliest approaches in this domain for a developing country like Bangladesh."
Poster: Flood Monitoring using Computer Vision,"Urban floods have become a constant threat to human life and property. Also, high resolution cameras in smart phones have become ubiquitous. This work involves using Computer Vision algorithms to estimate the depth of flooding based on images taken by the general public which are geo-tagged and time-stamped. This approach will help in the implementation of effective and timely urban flood relief and management. This data can also be used to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures taken in the past and to plan remedial measures in the future."
Poster: Impact of Ground Truth Errors on Wi-Fi Localization Accuracy,This study investigates the impact of small ground truth (GT) errors on indoor positioning systems based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting. The results demonstrate that even centimeter-scale GT deviations cause severe degradation of measured localization accuracy.
Poster: Observe. Patternize. Mimic.: Leveraging Patterns in Mobile-User Behavior for Enterprise Applications,"Application Mobilization, or the ability of an enterprise employee to rely on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, to continue to perform business workflows even when mobile, is seen as a game changer to improve productivity. However, the practical adoption of enterprise mobility is very much in its in fancy, and seemingly has barriers. We posit that these barriers include heavy user-burden in accomplishing tasks (e.g. number of actions required to execute a workflow), high cost of mobile access (e.g. latency for content fetching), and irrelevance of available mobile functions (e.g. mobile app defeaturization done inappropriately).The novelty of our research is in a unified observe-patternize-mimic paradigm we explore to address these barriers, based on a simple question: could patterns in user-behavior be learned, and leveraged for reducing user-burden? If patterns are discovered, then we show that intelligent mimicking of these patterns at appropriate junctures can considerably relieve the mobile user burden. We motivate this paradigm through three application scenarios representing read, write, and act usage modalities."
Poster: RTDroid: A Real-Time Solution with Android,"Since the introduction of the smartphone, mobile computing has become pervasive in our society. Meanwhile, Mobile devices have evolved far beyond the stereotypical personal devices and been employed in various traditional real-time embedded domains. Of the currently available mobile systems, Android has seen the most widespread deployment outside of the consumer electronics market. Its open source nature has prompted its ubiquitous adoption in sensing, medical, robotics, and autopilot applications. However, it is not surprising that Android does not provide any real-time guarantee since it is designed as a mobile system and optimised for mobility, user experience, and energy efficiency. Although there has been much interest in adopting Android in real-time contexts, surprisingly little work has been done to examine the suitability of Android for real-time systems. Existing work only provides solutions to traditional problems, including real-time garbage collection at the virtual machine layer, real-time OS scheduling and resource management. While it is critical to address these issues, it is by no means sufficient. After all, Android is a vast system that is more than a Java virtual machine and a kernel."
Poster: Securing Device Inputs for Smartphones Using Hypervisor Based Approach,"Smartphone device inputs, such as inputs from touchscreen, sensors, and GPS, carry sensitive user information, but are vulnerable to passive and active attacks. We present our ongoing design and implementation of SDIF, a Secure Device Input Framework for smartphones. The core components of SDIF are a small and dedicated bare-metal hypervisor built using ARM hardware virtualization support and a user-space sandbox framework. They collectively ensures SDIF's support for unmodified OSes and apps. SDIF guarantees the secure device inputs from hardware to target applications with two key designs. The first is a design of a secure path for input data to be delivered from input device drivers to target applications. The second is a design of trusted device data reading, which ensures input data generated by hardware is faithfully put to device driver memory."
Poster: Memory Protection in Ultra-Low-Power Multi-Application Wearables,"An increasing number of wearable devices support the execution of multiple third-party applications, increasing the functionality and flexibility of these devices. These multi-application, multi-tenant devices provide users with more options, and application developers with a standard platform. Typical ultra-low-power wearable devices, however, lack the type of hardware memory protection mechanisms~-- such as Memory Management Units (MMU)~-- needed to safely separate applications. At best, they provide a Memory Protection Unit (MPU), which allows the user to configure read/write/execute permissions for a few distinct regions of memory. At worst, no hardware memory protection is provided. MPU capabilities vary across hardware platforms, with many shortcomings: (1)~the MPU may only support a few distinct memory regions (fewer than one per application), (2)~the MPU may not protect all regions of memory, like hardware registers, and (3)~MPU protection boundary rules can be arcane, because they depend on opaque hardware implementations. Our key observation is that by supplementing a limited segment MPU with runtime checks, and using compile-time static analysis to explicitly layout applications in memory, we can guarantee application isolation (sandboxing) even on these limited MPUs, with lower overhead than software-only solutions."
Poster: Android Malware Detection using Multi-Flows and API Patterns,"This paper proposes a new technique for detecting mobile malware based on information flow analysis. Our approach focuses on the structure of information flows we gather in our analysis, and the patterns of behavior present in information flows. Our analysis not only gathers simple flows that have a single source and a single sink, but also Multi-Flows that either start from a single source and flow to multiple sinks, or start from multiple sources and flow to a single sink. This analysis captures more complex behavior that both recent malware and recent benign applications exhibit. We leverage N-gram analysis to understand both unique and common behavioral patterns present in Multi-Flows. Our tool leverages N-gram analysis over sequences of API calls that occur along control flow paths in Multi-Flows to precisely analyze Multi-Flows with respect to app behavior."
Poster: Camera Images Offloading in Low-resource Wireless Networks,"Camera snapshot images are widely used in IoT applications. However, when the applications are deployed in rural areas or poorly-performing networks, the images offloading usually exhausts the limited network resources. While we can certainly revamp the network links, we can also optimize the payload at the same time. In this paper, we propose a middlebox system design that exploits the patterns of similarity between consecutive camera snapshots to alleviate the network load. Our preliminary results show that despite of small errors introduced in the images, the amount of reduced payloads could be a valuable choice to alleviate poorly performing networks."
Poster: Redundancy Aided Vehicular Networking,"Vehicular applications are increasingly connected to cloud services. For example, route planning, gas price applications, and Siri-like personal assistants all respond to user queries based in part on cloud processing. Network communication thus is often a substantial component of user-perceived latency in vehicular applications. Current vehicular computing platforms typically connect to the cloud using a single cellular network provider. Network conditions can change rapidly as a vehicle moves due to geographical variation in coverage, radio shadows, and differing traffic density. Such variation is often exacerbated by connection re-establishment after an interface has entered a sleep state. Thus, vehicular applications can often appear unresponsive due to high wireless network latency. Even worse, the responsiveness is unpredictable; high tail latency makes some user interactions take longer, even when most interactions complete in an acceptable amount of time. This unpredictability is especially worrisome in a vehicular environment, in which occasional unexpected performance anomalies distract the driver of the vehicle."
Poster: Twirl:: On the Benefits of Adapting Orientation of a WiFi Access-Point,"The position of a wireless access point (AP) in wireless networks has been found to have a considerable impact on the overall network performance in indoor scenarios. Recent work has investigated the impact of the AP's location on the received signal strength of clients [1], and has shown that a 1:7x throughput improvement can be achieved by simply moving the AP in a 2ft. x 2ft. region. The benefits of small scale AP mobility is chiefly caused by mitigating multipath effects. In fact, the multipath effect has a significant impact on network performance and can be dramatically altered even with mere centimeter level movement of a Tx or a Rx. In this work, we investigate how network throughput performance can be improved if the AP is able to adapt its orientation. We consider two types of orientation changes - that of the AP's base platform (base orientation), and that of its antennas (antenna orientation). We show using experimental analysis that network throughput performance can be improved 1:8x by simply adapting AP's orientation."
Poster: Online Map Matching for Passive Indoor Positioning Systems,"Passive indoor positioning systems (PIPS) enable non-invasive tracking of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, Wi-Fi tags) using enterprise network infrastructure. This empowers operators of large airports and retail facilities to optimize cost-intensive resource allocation as well as to provide location-based services to their customers such as geo-fencing and proximity marketing. However, existing PIPS often generate noisy location estimates due to unpredictable interference and attenuation of wireless signals in indoor environments. To address this problem, we propose a novel map matching approach that uses a floor map to constrain location estimates to possible paths a mobile user can take."
Poster: Auracle: A Wearable Device for Detecting and Monitoring Eating Behavior,"Chronic disease is one of the most pressing health challenges facing the United States (and an increasing set of other countries). The onset or progression of diseases like obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorder are strongly related to eating behavior, and scientists are still trying to fully understand the complex mixture of diet, exercise, genetics, sociocultural context, and physical environment that lead to these diseases. Health science, however, has no effective means for automatically measuring eating behavior in free-living conditions. The Auracle aims to be a wearable earpiece that detects eating behavior, to be fielded by health-science researchers in their efforts to study eating behavior and ultimately to develop interventions useful to individuals striving to address chronic disease related to eating."
Poster: Characters vs. Words: Observations on Command Design for Brain-Computer Interfaces,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to communicate to a nearby computing device (computer, smartphone, etc.) using thoughts or other covert actions that result in a detectable change in brain-waves. Consider a BCI command to be a word consisting of a sequence of characters. Each character is a thought or action that can be reliably detected through brain waves. For this work, we specifically consider eye-blinks as the user action of interest. Eye-blinks are an interesting modality for BCI commands because of their easy detectability and naturalness (and hence covertness). It turns out that there is an interesting trade-off between the complexity of characters and the length of words. In this work, we perform a user-study to answer a simple, but important, question pertaining to eye-blinks based BCI command design: do users prefer shorter characters (and hence longer words) or shorter words (and hence longer characters) when performing commands?. We present a simple eye-blink language consisting of words and characters and use real user-experiments to study the aforementioned trade-off."
Poster: Field Testing Vehicular Networks using OpenC2X,"We present OpenC2X, an Open Source approach to field testing of vehicular networking solutions. Field Operational Test (FOT) and real-world experimentation are becoming more relevant to our research community as well as to industry and regulation. Unfortunately, available commercial solutions make experimental modifications to the protocol stack time consuming or prohibit it completely. To overcome this limitation, we implemented the ETSI ITS-G5 stack on a standard embedded PC hardware and running Linux system. OpenC2X is the first complete Open Source experimentation and prototyping platform. Our system is fully interoperable to commercial solutions, yet easily extensible with new protocols and applications for vehicular networks."
Poster: ARM Errata and their Software Workarounds,"Like software, hardware also has bugs. These bugs, or errata, can cause unexpected behaviors, reducing performance and causing malfunctions in the entire system. As there is no way to fix an erratum after hardware is deployed, its harmful effects are often mitigated by software workarounds, usually in low-level software such as operating system. The goal of our work is to ensure system correctness and security against the harmful effects of errata and their workarounds. The first step is to systematically understand them in the wild."
Poster: Extensive Evaluation of Emotional Contagion on Smiling Selfies over Social Network,"We propose ""SmileWave"", the first selfie social networking service to reveal the existence of emotional cognation through smiling selfies on the social network. We conducted multiple rounds of in-the-wild user studies with 86 cumulative total users for total duration of 5 weeks. Throughout the entire study, we confirmed the occurrence of smile-based emotional contagion over social network, not only in the momentary duration but in longer term period."
Demo: Mobile Contextual Advertising Platform based on Tiny Text Intelligence,"In-app advertising has become a significant source of revenue for mobile app. In order to improve the effectiveness of in-app ads, most ad networks focus on targeting a user based on the user's personal information collected from their ad library inside mobile apps and the global knowledge built from big data on ad servers. However, sharing user's sensitive information with the ad servers may raise privacy concerns. As opposed to targeting users, mobile contextual advertising seeks to target the app page a user is viewing. In this demo, we present a novel mobile contextual advertising platform, called MoCA, which is designed to improve the semantic relevance of in-app ads in a stand-alone, privacy-protecting manner on mobile devices. MoCA understands the semantics of app page and ads, and then matches semantically relevant ads to the page inside mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to implement the mobile contextual advertising platform based on the semantic approach without resort to ad servers."
Demo: BlueMountain: An Architecture to Customize Data Management on Mobile Systems,"BlueMountain is a system that enables building pluggable data management solutions which can be linked with any Android app at runtime, without requiring any modifications to the Android platform. BlueMountain simplifies the app development, provides flexibility to end users, and works with existing apps."
Demo: Fusing Mobile Sensors for Paper Keyboard On-the-Go,"Using touchscreens has largely limited user inputs to small form-factor devices. To address this constraint, we explore a novel input mechanism, dubbed PaperKey, that enables users to interact with mobile devices by performing multi-finger typing gestures on a surface where the device is placed. Using acceleration signals on the device, PaperKey infers the user's type events and then leverages a vision based technique for detecting the exact typing locations on a paper keyboard layout. Compared to single audio, image, or vibration sensing, this work accurately localizes keystrokes with faster processing speed. Additionally, this mechanism keeps the mobility of devices by working without external sensors."
Demo: sigSocial: A Novel Social Media Aggregation Service using a Tiny Text Intelligence,"We present an entirely novel concept of retrieving social media data, called sigSocial. It integrates social media data of various sources, using a semantic classifier. Nowadays, people use multiple social media simultaneously, acquiring information with ease. However, accessing numerous services to reach different channels is bothersome. Also, the volume of information one can process is limited. Our aim is to reduce this burden, providing easiness and efficiency. In other words, we attempt to build a single service that integrates information from various platforms. The application has three main features. First, it enables users to explore multiple social media without accessing them separately. Second, it organizes information retrieved from social medias into well-defined classes. Finally, it works as a stand-alone application, the mechanism of which is internal to the device, not relying on any external servers or networks. This method respects user privacy, which has recently gained much attention."
Demo: Fully Automated UI Testing System for Large-scale Android Apps Using Multiple Devices,"We demonstrate AutoClicker, a fully automated UI testing system for large-scale Android apps using multiple devices. It provides a way to quickly and easily verify that a large number of Android apps behave correctly at runtime in a repeatable manner."

Demo: Card-stunt as a Service: Empowering a Massively Packed Crowd for Instant Collective Expressiveness,"Consider a massive crowd who gathered together to convey their common voice to public, e.g., supporters of a team sitting together in a stadium, people doing a candlelight vigil in a public square, and so on. Imagine that they hold up their smartphone displays which collectively compose a huge public screen; the crowd's messages are now shown big on the top of them. We present CaaS [3], a mobile service to realize such an instant, massive, collective visualization with commodity smartphones and cloud services. In this demo, we demonstrate the collective localization feature of CaaS so that the audience can watch a given pattern or symbol collectively displayed on top of arbitrarily positioned phones (See the video demo, https://goo.gl/GfsORc)."
Demo: AWSense: A Framework for Collecting Sensing Data from the Apple Watch,"We present a framework - AWSense - for eased sensing data collection from an Apple Watch wearable device. The framework eases the access, transmission and export of sensing data from the device. This data comprises: heart rate, raw acceleration, and computed device motion. In our demo, we present sample applications built on top of this framework to show its capabilities, of real-time presentation and recording of the sensing data."
Demo: Riding the Non-linearities to Record Ultrasound with Smartphones,"We demonstrate that high frequency ultrasonic sounds can be designed to become recordable by unmodified smartphone microphones, while remaining inaudible to humans. The core idea lies in exploiting nonlinearities in microphone hardware with a combination of ultrasound frequencies. These frequencies can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to today's microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even acoustic Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks."
Demo: Detecting Group Formations using iBeacon Technology,"Researchers from different disciplines have examined crowd behavior in the past by employing a variety of methods including ethnographic studies, computer vision techniques and manual annotation based data analysis. However, because of the inherent difficulties in collecting, processing and analyzing the data, it is difficult to obtain large data sets for study. In this work we present a system for detecting stationary interactions inside crowds, depending entirely on the sensors available in a modern smartphone device such as Bluetooth Smart (BLE) and Accelerometer. By utilizing Apple's iBeaconTM implementation of Bluetooth Smart using SensingKit1, our open-source multi-platform mobile sensing framework [1], we are able to detect the proximity of users carrying a smartphone in their pocket. We then use an algorithm based on graph theory to predict group interactions inside the crowd. Previous work in this area has been limited to the detection of interactions between only two people and therefore our approach goes beyond current state of the art in its ability to detect group formations with more than two people involved. Our approach is particularly beneficial to the design and implementation of crowd behavior analytics, design of influence strategies, and algorithms for crowd reconfiguration."
Demo: Enabling Dynamic Gesture Mapping with UI Events,"We demonstrate Gesto, a dynamic gesture mapping tool. It provides users to map any gesture to a certain UI event that the users need. Also, the mapping can be easily changed by users."
Demo: iBlink: Smart Glasses for Facial Paralysis Patients,"Facial paralysis is a disease caused by nerve damage, which can make patients lose facial movements. Facial paralysis patients usually have muscles on one side of the face noticeably droop, which seriously impacts the person's quality of life as shown in Fig. [skull]. Worse still, the eye on the affected side is unable to blink and will become dry and infected by debries, which can incur eye damage even blindness. To the best of scientists' knowledge, the paralysis is due to the pressure incurred by infection in the tunnel containing main trunk of facial nerves, where the tunnel is inside of the people's head termed as the Facial canal. In this demo, we present iBlink [1], a novel system to help paralysis patients to blink. Paralysis usually occurs in just one side of the face, and clinical trials show that electrical stimulation could trigger blink. Based on such observations, the basic idea of iBlink is to monitor the normal side of the face with a camera and stimulate the paralysed side, so that eye-movements of the both sides become symmetric."
Demo: Reptor: Enabling API Virtualization on Android for Platform Openness,"We demonstrate Reptor, a bytecode instrumentation tool enabling API virtualization on Android. It provides a general way to alter functionality of platform APIs on Android. With Reptor, third-party developers can modify the behavior of platform APIs according to their needs. All modifications are completely at the app layer without modifying the underlying platform. This allows practical openness---third-party developers can easily distribute their modifications for a platform without the need to update the entire platform."
Demo: CELLI: Indoor Positioning using Polarized Sweeping Light Beams,"Indoor positioning enables location-based services for a wide range of commercial applications [4]. Existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems [5, 7] leverage the high image resolution of a receiving camera to support high positioning accuracy. However, power-hungry cameras are not desirable in many scenarios, e.g., smart factories, where small objects need to be accurately located and tracked. In this demo, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell, as shown in Fig. 1. CELLI further incorporates several novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electronic components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 12 cm and a median 2D error less than 2.7 cm."
Demo: Live Video Stream Triggers,"Live streaming is an increasingly popular way to broadcast videos ranging from formal news channels to kitten cams to home security camera feeds. Live streaming marries the rich detail of video with the timeliness of live transmission and the ease of use of consumer cameras, thus promising to vastly increase the amount of detailed, up-to-the minute information available about the real world. The volume of potentially interesting footage brings up the question of how end-users can avoid being glued to one (or worse, many) streams of videos waiting for events of interest. In this demo, we present Lookout, a system that allows users to register standing queries, called triggers over live video streams. Lookout then notifies the user when events of interest to them occur in their streams of interest. For example, a user could point to a cat cam and write a trigger that sends a notification when the cat wakes up and starts moving. Users can also write triggers to look for certain news being covered in a live new channel, a gamer moving to a certain level in a Twitch stream, a stranger showing up in a outdoor surveillance camera, etc."

BackDoor: Making Microphones Hear Inaudible Sounds,"Consider sounds, say at 40kHz, that are completely outside the human's audible range (20kHz), as well as a microphone's recordable range (24kHz). We show that these high frequency sounds can be designed to become recordable by unmodified microphones, while remaining inaudible to humans. The core idea lies in exploiting non-linearities in microphone hardware. Briefly, we design the sound and play it on a speaker such that, after passing through the microphone's non-linear diaphragm and power-amplifier, the signal creates a ""shadow"" in the audible frequency range. The shadow can be regulated to carry data bits, thereby enabling an acoustic (but inaudible) communication channel to today's microphones. Other applications include jamming spy microphones in the environment, live watermarking of music in a concert, and even acoustic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents BackDoor, a system that develops the technical building blocks for harnessing this opportunity. Reported results achieve upwards of 4kbps for proximate data communication, as well as room-level privacy protection against electronic eavesdropping."
Strata: Fine-Grained Acoustic-based Device-Free Tracking,"Next generation devices, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and smart appliances, demand a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with them. To address such needs, we develop a novel acoustic based device-free tracking system, called Strata, to enable a user to interact with a nearby device by simply moving his finger. In Strata, a mobile (e.g., smartphone) transmits known audio signals at inaudible frequency, and analyzes the received signal reflected by the moving finger to track the finger location. To explicitly take into account multipath propagation, the mobile estimates the channel impulse response (CIR), which characterizes signal traversal paths with different delays. Each channel tap corresponds to the multipath effects within a certain delay range. The mobile selects the channel tap corresponding to the finger movement and extracts the phase change of the selected tap to accurately estimate the distance change of a finger. Moreover, it estimates the absolute distance of the finger based on the change in CIR using a novel optimization framework. We then combine the absolute and relative distance estimates to accurately track the moving target. We implement our tracking system on Samsung Galaxy S4 mobile phone. Through micro-benchmarks and user studies, we show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and low latency without extra hardware."
SoundSifter: Mitigating Overhearing of Continuous Listening Devices,"In this paper, we study the overhearing problem of continuous acoustic sensing devices such as Amazon Echo, Google Home, or such voice-enabled home hubs, and develop a system called SoundSifter that mitigates personal or contextual information leakage due to the presence of unwanted sound sources in the acoustic environment. Instead of proposing modifications to existing home hubs, we build an independent embedded system that connects to a home hub via its audio input. Considering the aesthetics of home hubs, we envision SoundSifter as a smart sleeve or a cover for these devices. SoundSifter has hardware and software to capture the audio, isolate signals from distinct sound sources, filter out signals that are from unwanted sources, and process the signals to enforce policies such as personalization before the signals enter into an untrusted system like Amazon Echo or Google Home. We conduct empirical and real-world experiments to demonstrate that SoundSifter runs in real-time, is noise resilient, and supports selective and personalized voice commands that commercial voice-enabled home hubs do not."
BatMapper: Acoustic Sensing Based Indoor Floor Plan Construction Using Smartphones,"The lack of digital floor plans is a huge obstacle to pervasive indoor location based services (LBS). Recent floor plan construction work crowdsources mobile sensing data from smartphone users for scalability. However, they incur long time (e.g., weeks or months) and tremendous efforts in data collection, and many rely on images thus suffering technical and privacy limitations. In this paper, we propose BatMapper, which explores a previously untapped sensing modality -- acoustics -- for fast, fine grained and low cost floor plan construction. We design sound signals suitable for heterogeneous microphones on commodity smartphones, and acoustic signal processing techniques to produce accurate distance measurements to nearby objects. We further develop robust probabilistic echo-object association, recursive outlier removal and probabilistic resampling algorithms to identify the correspondence between distances and objects, thus the geometry of corridors and rooms. We compensate minute hand sway movements to identify small surface recessions, thus detecting doors automatically. Experiments in real buildings show BatMapper achieves 1-2cm distance accuracy in ranges up around 4m; a 2-3 minute walk generates fine grained corridor shapes, detects doors at 92% precision and 1~2m location error at 90-percentile; and tens of seconds of measurement gestures produce room geometry with errors <0.3m at 80-percentile, at 1-2 orders of magnitude less data amounts and user efforts."

Indoor Follow Me Drone,"With the availability of inexpensive and powerful drones, it is possible to let drones automatically follow a user for video taping. This can not only reduce cost, but also support video taping in situations where otherwise not possible (e.g., during private moments or at inconvenient locations like indoor rock climbing). While there have been many follow-me drones on the market for outdoors, which rely on GPS, enabling indoor follow-me function is more challenging due to the lack of an effective approach to track users in indoor environments. To this end, we develop a holistic system that lets a mobile phone carried by a user accurately track the drone's relative location and control it to maintain a specified distance and orientation for automatic video taping. We develop a series of techniques to (i) track a drone's location using acoustic signals with sub-centimeter errors even under strong propeller noise from the drone and complicated multipath in indoor environments, and (ii) solve practical challenges in applying model predictive control (MPC) framework to control the drone. The latter consists of developing measurement-based flight models, designing measurement techniques to provide feedback to the controller, and predicting the user's movement. We implement our system on AR Drone 2.0 and Samsung S7. The extensive evaluation shows that our drone can follow a user effectively and maintain a specified following distance and orientation within 2-3 cm and 1-3 degree errors, respectively. The videos taped by the drone during flight are smooth according to the jerk metric."
iBlink: Smart Glasses for Facial Paralysis Patients,"Facial paralysis makes patients lose their facial movements, which can incur eye damage even blindness since patients are incapable of blinking. The paralysis usually occurs on just one side of the face, and clinical trials show that electrical stimulation could trigger blink. Based on such observations, we design and implement a pair of smart glasses iBlink to assist facial paralysis patients to blink. The basic idea is to monitor the normal side of the face with a camera and stimulate the paralysed side, so that the blink of the both eyes become symmetric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of wearable device for facial paralysis therapy. Our contributions are: First, we propose an eye-blink detection mechanism based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which can detect asymmetric blinks of patients under various illumination conditions with an accuracy above 99%. Our eye-image library for training CNN models is published online for further related studies, which contains more than $30,000$ eye images. Second, we design and implement an automatic stimulation circuits to generate electrical impulse for stimulating the patient's facial nerve branches, which can configure operational parameters in a self-adaptive manner for different patients. Third, we implement the entire iBlink system, which integrates the two functions above and a communication function module for tele-medicine applications. Moreover, we conduct clinical trials in a hospital, in order to obtain the design basis and verify effectiveness of our device."
BigRoad: Scaling Road Data Acquisition for Dependable Self-Driving,"Advanced driver assistance systems and, in particular automated driving offers an unprecedented opportunity to transform the safety, efficiency, and comfort of road travel. Developing such safety technologies requires an understanding of not just common highway and city traffic situations but also a plethora of widely different unusual events (e.g., object on the road way and pedestrian crossing highway, etc.). While each such event may be rare, in aggregate they represent a significant risk that technology must address to develop truly dependable automated driving and traffic safety technologies. By developing technology to scale road data acquisition to a large number of vehicles, this paper introduces a low-cost yet reliable solution, BigRoad, that can derive internal driver inputs (i.e., steering wheel angles, driving speed and acceleration) and external perceptions of road environments (i.e., road conditions and front-view video) using a smartphone and an IMU mounted in a vehicle. We evaluate the accuracy of collected internal and external data using over 140 real-driving trips collected in a 3-month time period. Results show that BigRoad can accurately estimate the steering wheel angle with 0.69 degree median error, and derive the vehicle speed with 0.65 km/h deviation. The system is also able to determine binary road conditions with 95% accuracy by capturing a small number of brakes. We further validate the usability of BigRoad by pushing the collected video feed and steering wheel angle to a deep neural network steering wheel angle predictor, showing the potential of massive data acquisition for training self-driving system using BigRoad."
Characterizing Smartwatch Usage in the Wild,"Smartwatch has become one of the most popular wearable computers on the market. We conduct an IRB-approved measurement study involving 27 Android smartwatch users. Using a 106-day dataset collected from our participants, we perform in-depth characterization of three key aspects of smartwatch usage ""in the wild"": usage patterns, energy consumption, and network traffic. Based on our findings, we identify key aspects of the smartwatch ecosystem that can be further improved, propose recommendations, and point out future research directions."

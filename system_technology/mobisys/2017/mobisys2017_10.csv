Reptor: Enabling API Virtualization on Android for Platform Openness,"This paper proposes a new technique that enables open innovation in mobile platforms. Our technique allows third-party developers to modify, instrument, or extend platform API calls and deploy their modifications seamlessly. The uniqueness of our technique is that it enables modifications completely at the app layer without requiring any platform-level changes. This allows practical openness---third parties can easily distribute their modifications for a platform without the need to update the entire platform. To demonstrate the benefits of our technique, we have developed a prototype on Android called Reptor and used it to instrument real-world apps with novel functionality. Our evaluation in realistic scenarios shows that Reptor has little overhead in performance and energy, and only modest overhead in memory usage that ranges from 0.6% to 10% for the observed worst cases."
iCharge: User-Interactive Charging of Mobile Devices,"Charging mobile devices ""fast"" has been the focus of both industry and academia, leading to the deployment of various fast charging technologies. However, existing fast charging solutions are agnostic of users' available time for charging their devices, causing early termination of the intended/planned charging. This, in turn, accelerates the capacity fading of device battery and thus shortens the device operation. In this paper, we propose a novel user-interactive charging paradigm, called iCharge, that tailors the device charging to the user's real-time availability and need. The core of iCharge is a relaxation-aware (R-Aware) charging algorithm that maximizes the charged capacity within the user's available time and slows down the battery's capacity fading. iCharge also integrates R-Aware with existing fast charging algorithms via a user-interactive interface, allowing users to choose a charging method based on their availability and need. We evaluate iCharge via extensive laboratory experiments and field-tests on Android phones, as well as user studies. R-Aware is shown to slow down the battery fading by more than 36% on average, and up to 60% in extreme cases, when compared to existing fast charging algorithms. This slowdown of capacity fading translates to, for instance, an up to 2-hour extension of the LTE time for a Nexus 5X phone after its use for 2 years, according to our trace-driven analysis of 976 device charging cases of 7 users over 3 months."
Accelerating Mobile Web Loading Using Cellular Link Information,"Despite the 4G LTE's 10X capacity improvement over 3G, mobile Web loading latency remains a major issue that hampers user experience. The root cause lies in the inefficient transport-layer that underutilizes LTE capacity, due to high channel dynamics, wireless link losses, and insufficient application traffic to propel the bandwidth probing. In this paper, we propose Cellular Link-Aware Web loading (CLAW), which boosts mobile Web loading using a physical-layer informed transport protocol. CLAW harnesses the limited PHY-layer statistics available on LTE phones to quantitatively model the LTE channel resource utilization, which is then translated into a transport window that best fits the bandwidth. Consequently, CLAW can estimate and fully utilize the available bandwidth almost within one RTT. In addition, CLAW can precisely differentiate LTE wireless loss from congestion loss, and identify the rare cases when the wireline backhaul becomes the bottleneck. We have prototyped CLAW on commodity LTE phones. Across a wide range of experimental settings, CLAW consistently reduces Web loading latency by more than 30%, compared to classical TCP variants and state-of-the-art congestion controls for cellular networks."
Open Data Kit 2.0: A Services-Based Application Framework for Disconnected Data Management,"In resource-constrained communities, organizations often use information and communication technologies to amplify their limited resources to improve education, health, and economic opportunity. Over two-thirds of the world's population have mobile phones, yet less than half are connected to the Internet [23]. Organizations helping disadvantaged populations often rely on mobile devices as their primary computing resource because of their availability in resource-constrained contexts. However, to reach under-served populations, mobile applications often operate in areas with no connectivity or challenged network environments. Unfortunately, many mobile application frameworks are generally not well-suited for long periods of disconnected data collection and management. Furthermore, mobile application frameworks are generally aimed at users with significant technical skills and resources. In this paper, we discuss our experiences building, deploying, and refining the Open Data Kit (ODK) 2.0 tool suite. ODK 2.0 is a modular application framework that facilitates organizations with limited technical capacity to build application-specific information services for use in disconnected environments. We discuss ODK 2.0's flexible abstractions that enable users of varying technical skill levels to create customizable mobile data management solutions. We present ODK 2.0 case studies involving multiple organizations and discuss lessons learned from building a service-based mobile application framework for disconnected data management."

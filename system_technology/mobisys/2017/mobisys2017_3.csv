Enabling High-Precision Visible Light Localization in Today's Buildings,"For over one decade, research in visible light positioning has focused on using modulated LEDs as location landmarks. But the need for specialized LED fixtures, and the associated retrofitting cost, has been hindering the adoption of VLP. In this paper, we forgo this approach and design iLAMP to enable reliable, high-precision VLP using conventional LEDs and fluorescent lamps inside today's buildings. Our key observation is that these lamps intrinsically possess hidden visual features, which are imperceptible to human eyes, but can be extracted by capturing and processing the lamps' images using a computational imaging framework. Simply using commodity smartphones' front cameras, our approach can identify lamps within a building with close to 100% accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a geometrical model which combines the camera image with gyroscope/accelerometer output, to estimate a smartphone's 3D location and heading direction relative to each lamp landmark. Our field tests demonstrate a mean localization (heading) precision of 3 cm (2.6 degree) and 90-percentile 3.5 cm (2.8 degree), even if a single lamp falls in the camera's field of view."
POLI: Long-Range Visible Light Communications Using Polarized Light Intensity Modulation,"Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of light-to-camera communications for realizing applications such as localization, augmented reality and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. However, the fundamental requirement of visible light communications, flicker-free illumination, becomes a key limitation hindering existing technologies from serving a camera at larger distances. To break this limitation, this paper presents POLI, a light-to-camera communication system that exploits a novel POlarized Light Intensity modulation scheme to provide reliable communications for a wide range of distances. The key idea of POLI is to hide the information with the polarization direction of the light, to which human eyes are insensitive. Taking advantage of this, POLI can change the intensity of the polarized light as slowly as possible, at a rate determined by the range the system would support, but does not generate flickers. By using an optical component to ""transform polarization directions to colors"", POLI allows a camera to leverage its received RGB values as the three spatial dimensions to recover the information carried in different data streams. POLI further incorporates a number of designs to tackle the non-linearity effect of a camera, which is especially critical for an intensity-based modulation scheme. We implemented a prototype using the USRP N200 combined with off-the-shelf optical components. The experimental results show that POLI delivers to its camera receiver a throughput proportional to the dynamic channel conditions. The achievable throughput can be up to 71 bytes per second at short distances, while the service range can be up to 40 meters."
Card-stunt as a Service: Empowering a Massively Packed Crowd for Instant Collective Expressiveness,"Imagine a densely packed crowd that gathers to convey a common message, such as people in a candlelight vigil or a protest. We envision an innovation through mobile computing technologies to empower such a crowd by enabling them simply to hold their phones up and create a massive collective visualization on top of them. We propose Card-stunt as a Service (CaaS). CaaS is a service enabling a densely packed crowd to instantly visualize symbols using their mobile devices and a server-side service. The key challenge toward realizing an instant collective visualization is how to achieve instant, infrastructure-free, decimeter-level localization of individuals in a massively packed crowd, while maintaining low latency. CaaS addresses the challenges by mobile visible-light angle-of-arrival (AoA) sensing and scalable constrained optimization. It reconstructs relative locations of all individuals and dispatches individualized timed pixels to each one so that they can do their part in the overall visualization. We evaluate CaaS with extensive experiments under diverse reality settings as well as under synthetic workloads scaling up to tens of thousands of people. We deploy CaaS to 49 participants so that they successfully perform a collective visualization cheering up MobiSys."
CELLI: Indoor Positioning Using Polarized Sweeping Light Beams,"Existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems leverage the high image resolution of a receiving camera to support high positioning accuracy. However, power-hungry cameras might not always be applicable for many scenarios, such as smart factories, in which small objects require to be accurately localized and tracked. In this paper, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve an extremely high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small LCD is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell. CELLI further incorporates a number of novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electrical components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 11.8 cm and a median 2D positioning error to less than 2.7 cm."

SchrodinText: Strong Protection of Sensitive Textual Content of Mobile Applications,"Many mobile applications deliver and show sensitive and private textual content to users including messages, social network posts, account information, and verification codes. All such textual content must only be displayed to the user but must be strongly protected from unauthorized access in the device. Unfortunately, this is not the case in mobile devices today: malware that can compromise the operating system, e.g., gain root or kernel privileges, can easily access textual content of other applications. In this paper, we present SchrodinText, a system solution for strongly protecting the confidentiality of application's selected UI textual content from a fully compromised operating system. SchrodinText leverages a novel security monitor based on two hardware features on modern ARM processors: virtualization hardware and TrustZone. Our key contribution is a set of novel techniques that allow the operating system to perform the text rendering without needing access to the text itself, hence minimizing the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). These techniques, collectively called oblivious rendering, enable the operating system to rasterize and lay out all the characters without access to the text; the monitor only resolves the right character glyphs onto the framebuffer observed by the user and protects them from the operating system, e.g., against DMA attacks. We present our prototype using an ARM Juno development board and Android operating system. We show that SchrodinText incurs noticeable overhead but that its performance is usable."
Matthan: Drone Presence Detection by Identifying Physical Signatures in the Drone's RF Communication,"Drones are increasingly flying in sensitive airspace where their presence may cause harm, such as near airports, forest fires, large crowded events, secure buildings, and even jails. This problem is likely to expand given the rapid proliferation of drones for commerce, monitoring, recreation, and other applications. A cost-effective detection system is needed to warn of the presence of drones in such cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of inexpensive RF-based detection of the presence of drones. We examine whether physical characteristics of the drone, such as body vibration and body shifting, can be detected in the wireless signal transmitted by drones during communication. We consider whether the received drone signals are uniquely differentiated from other mobile wireless phenomena such as cars equipped with Wi- Fi or humans carrying a mobile phone. The sensitivity of detection at distances of hundreds of meters as well as the accuracy of the overall detection system are evaluated using software defined radio (SDR) implementation."
System Service Call-oriented Symbolic Execution of Android Framework with Applications to Vulnerability Discovery and Exploit Generation,"Android Application Framework is an integral and foundational part of the Android system. Each of the 1.4 billion Android devices relies on the system services of Android Framework to manage applications and system resources. Given its critical role, a vulnerability in the framework can be exploited to launch large-scale cyber attacks and cause severe harms to user security and privacy. Recently, many vulnerabilities in Android Framework were exposed, showing that it is vulnerable and exploitable. However, most of the existing research has been limited to analyzing Android applications, while there are very few techniques and tools developed for analyzing Android Framework. In particular, to our knowledge, there is no previous work that analyzes the framework through symbolic execution, an approach that has proven to be very powerful for vulnerability discovery and exploit generation. We design and build the first system, Centaur, that enables symbolic execution of Android Framework. Due to some unique characteristics of the framework, such as its middleware nature and extraordinary complexity, many new challenges arise and are tackled in Centaur. In addition, we demonstrate how the system can be applied to discovering new vulnerability instances, which can be exploited by several recently uncovered attacks against the framework, and to generating PoC exploits."

CASE: Comprehensive Application Security Enforcement on COTS Mobile Devices,"Without violating existing app security enforcement, malicious modules inside apps, such as a library or an external class, can steal private data and abuse sensitive capabilities meant for other modules inside the same apps. These so-called ""module-level attacks"" are quickly emerging, fueled by the pervasive use of third-party code in apps and the lack of module-level security enforcement on mobile platforms."
Targeted Mimicry Attacks on Touch Input Based Implicit Authentication Schemes,"Touch input implicit authentication (``touch IA'') employs behavioural biometrics like touch location and pressure to continuously and transparently authenticate smartphone users. We provide the first ever evaluation of targeted mimicry attacks on touch IA and show that it fails against shoulder surfing and offline training attacks. Based on experiments with three diverse touch IA schemes and 256 unique attacker-victim pairs, we show that shoulder surfing attacks have a bypass success rate of 84% with the majority of successful attackers observing the victim's behaviour for less than two minutes. Therefore, the accepted assumption that shoulder surfing attacks on touch IA are infeasible due to the hidden nature of some features is incorrect. For offline training attacks, we created an open-source training app for attackers to train on their victims' touch data. With this training, attackers achieved bypass success rates of 86%, even with only partial knowledge of the underlying features used by the IA scheme. Previous work failed to find these severe vulnerabilities due to its focus on random, non-targeted attacks. Our work demonstrates the importance of considering targeted mimicry attacks to evaluate the security of an implicit authentication scheme. Based on our results, we conclude that touch IA is unsuitable from a security standpoint."
Privacy Capsules: Preventing Information Leaks by Mobile Apps,"Preventing the leakage of user information via untrusted third-party apps is a key challenge in mobile privacy. We propose and evaluate privacy capsules (PCs), a platform execution model for mobile apps that prevents the flow of private information to untrusted parties by design. With PCs, apps execute in two sequential phases. In the unsealed phase, the app has no access to sensitive input but full access to untrusted network resources. In the sealed state, the untrusted app has access to sensitive input, but can no longer communicate with untrusted resources. Privacy capsules are implemented by the mobile platform, are language independent, and require few changes to apps. Using a prototype PC implementation in Android, we show that PCs have low performance and energy overhead, and are suitable for a large class of apps."
Regulating ARM TrustZone Devices in Restricted Spaces,"Smart personal devices equipped with a wide range of sensors and peripherals can potentially be misused in various environments. They can be used to exfiltrate sensitive information from enterprises and federal offices or be used to smuggle unauthorized information into classrooms and examination halls. One way to prevent these situations is to regulate how smart devices are used in such restricted spaces. In this paper, we present an approach that robustly achieves this goal for ARM TrustZone-based personal devices. In our approach, restricted space hosts use remote memory operations to analyze and regulate guest devices within the restricted space. We show that the ARM TrustZone allows our approach to obtain strong security guarantees while only requiring a small trusted computing base to execute on guest devices."

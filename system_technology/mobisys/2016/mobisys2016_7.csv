FOCUS: Robust Visual Codes for Everyone,"Visual codes are used to embed digital data in physical objects, or they are shown in video sequences to transfer data over screen/camera links. Existing codes either carry limited data to make them robust against a range of channel conditions (e.g., low camera quality or long distances), or they support a high data capacity but only work over a narrow range of channel conditions. We present FOCUS, a new code design that does not require this explicit trade-off between code capacity and the reader's channel quality. Instead, FOCUS builds on concepts from OFDM to encode data at different levels of spatial detail. This enables each reader to decode as much data from a code as its channel quality allows. We build a prototype of FOCUS devices and evaluate it experimentally. Our results show that FOCUS gracefully adapts to the reader's channel, and that it provides a significant performance improvement over recently proposed designs, including Strata and PixNet."
Practical Bluetooth Traffic Sniffing: Systems and Privacy Implications,"With the prevalence of personal Bluetooth devices, potential breach of user privacy has been an increasing concern. To date, sniffing Bluetooth traffic has been widely considered an extremely intricate task due to Bluetooth's indiscoverable mode, vendor-dependent adaptive hopping behavior, and the interference in the open 2.4 GHz band. In this paper, we present BlueEar -a practical Bluetooth traffic sniffer. BlueEar features a novel dual-radio architecture where two Bluetooth-compliant radios coordinate with each other on learning the hopping sequence of indiscoverable Bluetooth networks, predicting adaptive hopping behavior, and mitigating the impacts of RF interference. Experiment results show that BlueEar can maintain a packet capture rate higher than 90% consistently in real-world environments, where the target Bluetooth network exhibits diverse hopping behaviors in the presence of dynamic interference from coexisting Wi-Fi devices. In addition, we discuss the privacy implications of the BlueEar system, and present a practical countermeasure that effectively reduces the packet capture rate of the sniffer to 20%. The proposed countermeasure can be easily implemented on the Bluetooth master device while requiring no modification to slave devices like keyboards and headsets."
Characterizing and Improving WiFi Latency in Large-Scale Operational Networks,"WiFi latency is a key factor impacting the user experience of modern mobile applications, but it has not been well studied at large scale. In this paper, we design and deploy WiFiSeer, a framework to measure and characterize WiFi latency at large scale. WiFiSeer comprises a systematic methodology for modeling the complex relationships between WiFi latency and a diverse set of WiFi performance metrics, device characteristics, and environmental factors. WiFiSeer was deployed on Tsinghua campus to conduct a WiFi latency measurement study of unprecedented scale with more than 47,000 unique user devices. We observe that WiFi latency follows a long tail distribution and the 90th (99th) percentile is around 20 ms (250 ms). Furthermore, our measurement results quantitatively confirm some anecdotal perceptions about impacting factors and disapprove others. We deploy three practical solutions for improving WiFi latency in Tsinghua, and the results show significantly improved WiFi latencies. In particular, over 1,000 devices use our AP selection service based on a predictive WiFi latency model for 2.5 months, and 72% of their latencies are reduced by over half after they re-associate to the suggested APs."
ReCon: Revealing and Controlling PII Leaks in Mobile Network Traffic,"It is well known that apps running on mobile devices extensively track and leak users' personally identifiable information (PII); however, these users have little visibility into PII leaked through the network traffic generated by their devices, and have poor control over how, when and where that traffic is sent and handled by third parties. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of ReCon: a cross-platform system that reveals PII leaks and gives users control over them without requiring any special privileges or custom OSes. ReCon leverages machine learning to reveal potential PII leaks by inspecting network traffic, and provides a visualization tool to empower users with the ability to control these leaks via blocking or substitution of PII. We evaluate ReCon's effectiveness with measurements from controlled experiments using leaks from the 100 most popular iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps, and via an IRB-approved user study with 92 participants. We show that ReCon is accurate, efficient, and identifies a wider range of PII than previous approaches."

Being more Effective and Interpretable: Bridging the Gap Between Heuristics and AI for ABR Algorithms,"In this poster, we propose several novel ABR approaches, namely BBA+ and MPC+, which are the fusion of heuristics and AI-based schemes. Results indicate that the proposed methods perform better than recent heuristic ABR methods. Meanwhile, such methods have also become more interpretable compared with AI-based schemes."

Cooperative Trajectory Optimization for a Cellular Internet of UAVs,"In this poster, we study a cellular Internet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in which one UAV collects data from ground sensors (GSs), and one UAV relays the sensory data to the base station (BS). Since the trajectories of these two UAVs have impact on each other, we formulate a cooperative trajectory optimization problem to minimize the completion time for all the tasks. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm that solves the trajectories of the two UAVs iteratively. Simulation results show that the completion time for all the tasks in the proposed scheme is significantly improved than the non-cooperative scheme."

Web Quality of Experience from Encrypted Packets,"Pervasive encryption makes it hard for ISPs to manage their network. Yet, to avoid user churn at times of shrinking revenues, ISPs must be able to assess the quality of experience they are delivering to their customers. The case of the Web is particularly complex, with a plethora of recently proposed in-browser metrics that aim at capturing the page visual rendering quality (e.g. Above the Fold and SpeedIndex). In this demo, we showcase that such metrics can be estimated quite accurately just from streams of encrypted packets, using classic supervised learning techniques."

An Edge Computing Marketplace for Distributed Machine Learning,"There is an increasing demand among machine learning researchers for powerful computational resources to train their machine learning models. In order to train these models in a reasonable amount of time, the training is often distributed among multiple machines; yet paying for such machines is costly. DeepMarket attempts to reduce these costs by creating a marketplace that integrates multiple computational resources over a distributed tensorflow framework. Instead of requiring users to rent expensive resources from a third party cloud provider, DeepMarket will allow users to lend their computing resources to each other when they are available. Such a marketplace, however, requires a credit mechanism that ensures users receive resources in proportion to the resources they lend to others. Moreover, DeepMarket must respect users' needs to use their own resources and the resulting limits on when resources can be lent to others. This Demo will introduce the audience to PLUTO: DeepMarket's intuitive graphical user interface. The audience will be able to see how PLUTO in coordination with DeepMarket servers tracks the performance of each user's training jobs, matches jobs to resources made available by other users, and tracks the resulting credits that regulate the exchange of resources."
Cooperative Signaling of DDoS Attacks in a Blockchain-based Network,"Driven by the increasing number of stationary and portable devices, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks pose a major threat to Internet availability. While advantages of cooperative defenses have been widely recognized over traditional on-premise defenses, there is not a widespread deployment of such cooperative defenses. This work demonstrates the Blockchain Signaling System (BloSS), a modular, network-agnostic and cooperative DDoS defense system consisting of independent instances working together to mitigate attacks targeted at any member of this alliance."

NOracle: Who is communicating with whom in my network?,"This demo presents NOracle: a system using Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) to infer structural roles of hosts and communication patterns of services in networks. NOracle can be used with existing monitoring systems to analyze and visualize networks in an online manner or be used to analyze stored traces. Network operators can use SBMs to monitor and verify network operation, detect possible security issues and change-points. To showcase this, NOracle combines the production-grade network management solution StableNet with an SBM based anomaly detection and network visualization module. StableNet provides network flow statistics in real-time from actual devices. The SBM extracts roles and communication patterns live from the data provided by StableNet. The result can help to reason about communication behaviors, detect anomalous hosts and indicate changes in the large scale-structure of network communication."
Faster Control Plane Experimentation with Horse,"Simulation and emulation are popular approaches for experimentation in Computer Networks. However, due to their respective inherent drawbacks, existing solutions cannot perform both fast and realistic control plane experiments. To close this gap, we introduce Horse. Horse is a hybrid solution with an emulated control plane, for realism, and simulated data plane, for speed. Our decoupling of the control and data plane allows us to speed up the experiments without sacrificing control plane realism."
Resilient Disaggregated Network Flow Monitoring,"Sketch has been extensively used for scalable network monitoring, which unfortunately, is sensitive to hash collisions. Deploying the sketch involves fine-grained performance control and instrumentation. This paper presents a new class of sketch structure that proactively minimizes the estimation error and reduces the error variance. We develop a disaggregated monitoring application that natively scales the sketching deployment. Testbed and real-world trace-driven simulations show that LSS achieves close-to-optimal performance under hash collisions."
HyFabric: Minimizing FCT in Optical and Electrical Hybrid Data Center Networks,"In this paper, we propose HyFabric, jointing the flow and circuit scheduling to minimize flow completion times (FCT) in optical and electrical hybrid data center networks. Our extensive evaluation results show that HyFabric reduces 93% FCT and 32% energy consumption compared with Solstice[4] and ProjecToR[3]. And it delivers comparable FCT and reduces 5% ~ 14% energy consumptions compared with pFabric[1]."
QUINCE: A unified crowdsourcing-based QoE measurement platform,"Assessing QoE in situ is a challenging task. Researchers have employed crowdsourcing-based approaches to achieve scale and diversity of subjects, but not without confounding factors. Apart from subjective bias of users, environmental factors introduce variance to QoE measurements. We propose QUINCE, a QoE measurement platform, which uses a gamified approach to enable longitudinal study with repeated and varying measurements in a single platform. We leveraged existing Internet measurement data and infrastructures to integrate three different types of network and QoE measurements to yield a more comprehensive view of subjects. Our preliminarily results show that QUINCE achieves a high level of engagement from subjects and collects data that is useful for correlating network performance and YouTube video streaming QoE."
Learning Tree: Neural Network-based Index for NDN Forwarding Plane,"Named Data Networking (NDN) is a recent promising future Internet architecture, which forwards packets based on the named data. To realize this paradigm, a quick enough index with high capacity for forwarding processes has to be utilized in NDN forwarding plane. Unfortunately, all indexes proposed are based on the traditional data structures, which have to make a trade-off between the memory consumption and the lookup speed. In view of this, a neural network-based index, called Learning Tree, is proposed in NDN forwarding plane. Preliminary evaluations indicate that Learning Tree can minimize the memory consumption to 20% compared with traditional hash table and has a practicable high name lookup speed."
iBaby: A Mobile Children Monitoring and Finding System with Stranger Holding Detection Based on IoT Technologies,"This paper designs and implements a mobile children monitoring and finding system, called iBaby, using wearable devices and nearby smartphones to detect unexpected holding and find missing children through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, respectively. In the monitoring mode, the iBaby system can prevent young children from taking away by strangers/people with bad intentions. In the finding mode, the iBaby system can cooperatively find missing children equipped with hand wearable devices consisting of the mobile iBeacon and 3-axis accelermeter through crowdsourced sensing networks formed by smartphone users with outdoor GPS and indoor IoT localization. To accurately detect stranger holding behaviors, multi-feature based, artificial neural network based, and convolutional neural network based posture recognition methods are designed to improve recognition success rates of iBaby as much as possible. In particular, an iOS-based prototype with Arduino wearable devices and static iBeacon nodes is implemented to verify the feasibility and correctness of our iBaby system."

Cheetah: Accelerating Database Queries with Switch Pruning,"Modern database systems are growing increasingly distributed and struggle to reduce the query completion time with a large volume of data. In this poster, we propose to leverage programmable switches in the network to offload part of the query computation to the switch. While switches provide high performance, they also have many resource and programming constraints that make it hard to implement diverse database queries. To fit in these constraints, we introduce the concept of data pruning - filtering out entries which are guaranteed not to affect the output. The database system then runs the same query, but on the pruned data, which significantly reduces the processing time. We propose a set of pruning algorithms for a variety of queries. We implement our system, Cheetah, on a Barefoot Tofino switch and Spark. Our evaluation on the Berkeley AMPLab benchmark shows up to 3x improvement in the query completion time compared to Apache Spark."
Measurement and Redesign of BBR-based MPTCP,"BBR is a congestion-based congestion control algorithm proposed to promote the performance of TCP. The interesting and vital question is thus: How would MPTCP perform on BBR? We first conduct extensive experimental evaluation of BBR-based MPTCP, and show that it provides several times throughput higher and more stable sending rate than that of others. We also observe that to replace the congestion control in MPTCP, some important algorithms in MPTCP need to be re-designed: 1) To achieve fairness with other flows, we propose a BBR based coupled congestion control algorithm, called Coupled BBR; 2) To further prevent performance degradation in highly dynamic nature, we also propose a scheduler to take advantage of dynamic redundancy."

Hard Virtualization of P4-based switches with VirtP4,"We present VirtP4, a conceptual architecture for hard (type-1) virtualization of P4-based switch programs in a NetFPGA SUME board. In contrast to existing (type-2) solutions like Hyper4, HyperVDP, and P4Visor, our design does not require access to switch source code (either for merging or custom compilation). We thus preserve the intellectual property of switch programs, while providing near line-rate performance for virtual switch instances."

Attack Time Localization using Interval Queries,"Modern telemetry systems require advanced analytic capabilities such as drill down queries. These queries can be used to detect the beginning and end of a network anomaly by efficiently refining the search space. We present the first integral solution that (i) enables multiple measurement tasks inside the same data structure, (ii) supports specifying the time frame of interest as part of its queries, and (iii) is sketch-based and thus space efficient. Namely, our approach allows the user to define both the measurement task (e.g., heavy hitters, entropy estimation, cardinality estimation) and the time frame of relevance (e.g., 5PM-6PM) at query time. Our approach provides accuracy guarantees and is the only space-efficient solution that offers such capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to accurately pinpoint the beginning of a realistic DDoS attack."

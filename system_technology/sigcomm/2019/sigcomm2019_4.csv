iTLS/iDTLS: Lightweight End-to-End Security Protocol for IoT Through Minimal Latency,"Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) are the de-facto protocols of Internet of Things (IoT) for end-to-end secure communication. However, typical deployment scenarios of highly constrained devices in low-power and lossy networks make TLS and DTLS inefficient and insecure. In this work, we propose iTLS/iDTLS, a lightweight end-to-end secure transport protocol for IP-based IoT that delivers protected data on the first flight of the handshake without compromising forward secrecy, and provides mutual authentication without using certificates. The preliminary evaluation shows that iTLS/iDTLS reduces the traffic overhead by at least 71%, and the handshake latency by at least 59% compared to the original protocol."

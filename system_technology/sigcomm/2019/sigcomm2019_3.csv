SINET: Enabling Scalable Network Routing with Deep Reinforcement Learning on Partial Nodes,"In this paper, we propose SINET, a scalable and intelligent network control framework for routing optimization. SINET uses the idea of partial control to collect network information from critical nodes and uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to dynamically optimizes routing policies based on the collected network information. Simulation results show that SINET can reduce the average flow completion time and exhibit better robustness against minor topology changes, compared to existing DRL-based schemes."
Real-Time Power Profiling of Narrowband Internet of Things Networks,"Narrowband-Internet of Things is an emerging cellular communication technology designed for low power wide area applications. It is still in its early stage of deployment. Despite the increasing interest in NB-IoT, its communication reliability, energy efficiency, and protocol-level interactions in real-world deployments remain unclear to both industrial and academic research communities. In this demo, we present NBInsight, a platform that provides comprehensive measuring and logging functions for NB-IoT network diagnostics. We identify factors residing in the eNodeB configuration that contribute to the energy consumption of User Equipment (UE) by conducting extensive field tests."
Identifying Structural Hole Spanners in Online Social Networks Using Machine Learning,"Online social networks play an important role in our daily activities. As an important concept in social network analytics, the structural hole theory shows that the positions in social networks that can bridge different user groups will get benefits. Existing solutions for identifying structural hole spanners normally require the knowledge of the entire social graph. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to uncover structural hole spanners according to the users' profiles and user-generated contents (UGCs), instead of referring to the entire social graph. We propose a machine learning-based model to implement the identification. We further leverage the ego networks and the cross-site linking function to enhance the identification. A real-world dataset collected from Foursquare and Twitter is used to evaluate the identification performance of our model. The results show that our model can achieve a high F1-score of 0.857."
Network-Aware and Unsupervised Diagnostics for Latent Issues in Network Management Databases,"Network management database (NMD) is essential in modern large-scale networks. Operators rely on NMD to provide accurate and up-to-date data, however, NMD---like any other databases---can suffers from latent issues such as inconsistent, incorrect, and missing data. In this work, we first reveal latent data issues in NMDs using real traces from a large cloud provider, Tencent. Then we design and implement an diagnostic system, NAuditor, for unsupervised identification of latent issues in NMDs. In the process, we design a compact and graph-based data structure to efficiently encode the complete NMD as a Knowledge Graph, and model the diagnostic problems as unsupervised Knowledge Graph Refinement problems. We show that the new encoding achieves superior performance than alternatives, and can facilitate adoption of state-of-the-art KGR algorithms. We also have used NAuditor in a production NMD, and found 61 real latent issues, which all have been confirmed by operators."
Device-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming,"The rising demand for high-resolution videos and high video frame rates are leading to increasing pressure on the memory available in mobile devices. In this work, we analyze how and when memory usage on a device impacts video performance. We propose and evaluate DAVS, a video client module that adapts the playback buffer size and the video bitrate based on device memory pressure."
"Smile, you are in the spotlight!","In future smart factories, robots performing critical tasks will require ultra-reliable networks. Meanwhile, LED light is ubiquitous in smart factories. To make the emerging LED-enabled Visible Light Communication (VLC) a suitable candidate for networking robots in future smart factories, the VLC channels must be very robust and homogeneous. In this work, we present two techniques to achieve ultra-reliable VLC networks: (1) by increasing the transmitter density and (2) by orienting the transmitters to the receiver, i.e., creating a spotlight. We show that both of our techniques can improve the reliability performance of VLC networks greatly. A real-life demo video of creating such a spotlight is available on https://youtu.be/VNu48Gidz_c."

Fast EPC: A Low Latency Cellular Control Plane,"Timely completion of control plane operations is critical to providing fast data access in cellular networks. In this work, we design a new edge-based cellular control plane, Fast EPC, which reduces control plane latency through fast serialization of control messages and rapid failure recovery."
A Light-weight Wi-Fi Fingerprint Generator with AR,"Compared with outdoor localization, indoor localization remains knotty. To cope with this problem, people have developed some indoor localization systems based on Wi-Fi fingerprints. However, in order to get the fingerprints, pre-collection of ample Wi-Fi signal features at selected indoor locations is needed, which is time-consuming. In this poster, we presented a light way to obtain the indoor Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints with the combination of Augmented Reality (AR). We believe the new fingerprint generating approach will shorten the time in data collecting phase and improve the time-efficiency of such methods."
ZiFi: a lightweight Cross-Technology Communication via RSS Encoding,"Cross-Technology Communication opens a new direction to solve the coexistence and collaboration among heterogeneous wireless devices in ISM band. At present, many CTC technologies have been proposed. However, there are few high throughput CTC works from ZigBee to WiFi. Our approach, called ZiFi, is a novel CTC framework that lightweight enough to convey data from ZigBee to WiFi. The key idea of ZiFi is to modulate symbol message by leveraging change of the ZigBee packets power. At the receiver side, WiFi device senses RSS value and recognizes ZigBee signal energy pattern to decode transmitted symbols. We finally implement and evaluate ZiFi on commodity WiFi and ZigBee devices. Our results show that it is feasible to use RSS of ZigBee packets and ZiFi can achieve a throughput rate of 297.1bps (the latest packet-level CTC method is 215.9bps). Here we demonstrate using ZiFi on a laptop to receive temperature data from a ZigBee node."
Challenging the generalization capabilities of Graph Neural Networks for network modeling,"Today, network operators still lack functional network models able to make accurate predictions of end-to-end Key Performance Indicators (e.g., delay or jitter) at limited cost. Recently a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model called RouteNet was proposed as a cost-effective alternative to estimate the per-source/destination pair mean delay and jitter in networks. Thanks to its GNN architecture that operates over graph-structured data, RouteNet revealed an unprecedented ability to learn and model the complex relationships among topology, routing and input traffic in networks. As a result, it was able to make performance predictions with similar accuracy than resource-hungry packet-level simulators even in network scenarios unseen during training. In this demo, we will challenge the generalization capabilities of RouteNet with more complex scenarios, including larger topologies."
The Performance of Multi-Path TCP with Overlapping Paths,"Turning the Internet into a multi-path environment could solve many difficulties network operators are facing today. There are already solutions to configure an IP network to offer multiple partially disjoint paths towards the destination. In this demo, we focus on the performance of how MPTCP can distribute the traffic along these paths. When the routes are not fully disjoint their throughput could be limited by some bottleneck links. Because of this dependency finding the maximal throughput in MPTCP may call for solving a complex maximization problem. Through constructing an example network as an illustrative model of real network conditions, we show, how complicated the underlying optimization problem MPTCP may face, and through measurements, demonstrate how the various congestion mechanisms deal with finding a solution."
Adaptive Fuzzy Game-based Energy Efficient Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks,"Given the limited battery lifetime and difficulties for harvesting energy in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), the localization problem of underwater sensor nodes poses crucial challenges. In this paper, an Adaptive Energy Efficient Localization Algorithm (Adaptive EELA) using the Fuzzy game theoretic method is proposed to solve the environment learning and adaptation issues of UWSNs. The proposed Adaptive EELA is able to automatically learn in the offline phase, which is required only once. Then, in the online phase, it can adapt to the dynamic environment, such as the densities or topologies of nodes. Our initial results demonstrate that the proposed Adaptive EELA achieves a high energy reduction per node on average comparing to state-of-the-art approaches."
White Mirror: Leaking Sensitive Information from Interactive Netflix Movies using Encrypted Traffic Analysis,"Privacy leaks from Netflix videos/movies are well researched. Current state-of-the-art works have been able to obtain coarse-grained information such as the genre and the title of videos by passive observation of encrypted traffic. However, leakage of fine-grained information from encrypted video traffic has not been studied so far. Such information can be used to build behavioral profiles of viewers."
A fast flow table engine for Open vSwitch with high performance on both lookups and updates,"To support fast rule updates in SDN, the Open vSwitch uses a variant of Tuple Space Search (TSS) for flow table lookups, which is less efficient than decision trees on packet classifications. In this poster, we present our latest work on building fast flow table engine in Open vSwitch, which achieves high-speed table lookups and fast rule updates simultaneously. By mapping rules into tree nodes dynamically, a very limited TSS-assisted balanced trees can be generated without the trouble of rule replications. Preliminary experimental results show that using ClassBench, our work has comparable update performance to the TSS algorithm in Open vSwitch, while achieving almost an order-of-magnitude improvement on lookup performance over TSS on average."
Decoupling Delay and Resource Sharing Targets with Efficient Core-Stateless AQM,"Core-Stateless resource sharing control identifies flow aggregates in the edge and marks packets based on the relevant policies. Within the core of the network, no flow identification or policy knowledge is needed to realize the desired resource sharing. As packet marking needs trust and the behavior of core-routers is independent of the number of flow aggregates, it is a natural choice for high-speed closed domain networks. In this demo paper, the Per Packet Value (PPV) core-stateless resource sharing framework is extended with an efficient AQM algorithm that decouples delay and resource sharing targets (separating the importance of a packet and its delay requirement). The marking algorithms of PPV and the proposed Core-Stateless AQM method implemented in DPDK are evaluated under various traffic loads in a network with a 10 Gbps bottleneck. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed solution protects flows (e.g. download, gaming) of different delay requirements and resource sharing policies from a misbehaving low-delay and high-priority flow."
Fast and Scalable Name Prefix Lookup with Hash Table,No abstract available.
Bounded Latency with RoCE,"Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) provisioned in the cloud require deterministic and reliable services. Networking has a major impact on cloud based services, thus we focus on RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE), as a combination of Ethernet, the ubiquitous networking technology, and RDMA, which provides extremely low latency. RoCE significantly outperforms socket communication, confirmed by our measurements, but we also show that maximum latencies are orders of magnitude larger than the average. We provide methods how to keep even maximum latencies low while concurrent network traffic is also present in the infrastructure."
Sharpening Kubernetes for the Edge,"Kubernetes has become the most popular cluster manager during the past 5 years. It is used primarily for orchestrating data center deployments running web applications. Its powerful features, e.g., self-healing and scaling, have attracted a huge community, which in turn, is inducing a meteoric rise of this open source project. We venture to shape Kubernetes to be suited for edge infrastructure. As mostly delay-sensitive applications are to be deployed in the edge, a topology-aware Kubernetes is needed, extending its widely-used feature set with regard to network latency. Moreover, as the edge infrastructure is highly prone to failures and is considered to be expensive to build and maintain, self-healing features must receive more emphasis than in the baseline Kubernetes. We therefore designed a custom Kubernetes scheduler that makes its decisions with applications' delay constraints and edge reliability in mind. In this demonstration we show the novel features of our Kubernetes extension, and describe the solution that we release as open source."

Bridging the Data Charging Gap in the Cellular Edge,"The 4G/5G cellular edge promises low-latency experiences anywhere, anytime. However, data charging gaps can arise between the cellular operators and edge application vendors, and cause over-/under-billing. We find that such gap can come from data loss, selfish charging, or both. It can be amplified in the edge, due to its low-latency requirements. We devise TLC, a Trusted, Loss-tolerant Charging scheme for the cellular edge. In its core, TLC enables loss-selfishness cancellation to bridge the gap, and constructs publicly verifiable proof-of-charging for mutual trust. We implement TLC with commodity edge and small cells, and validate its viability."

Towards an AQM Evaluation Testbed with P4 and DPDK,"Active Queue Management (AQM) addresses the problem arising from using unnecessarily large, unmanaged buffers and thus it aims at improving network and application performance. AQM methods introduce different drop policies to proactively drop packets according to queue states and parameters. Though we are living in an AQM renaissance, comprehensive methodology and framework for performance evaluation under realistic traffic loads are still missing. With the advent of P4, description, validation and evaluation of AQM algorithms in a generic framework have become possible since the different drop policies applied by these methods can be implemented in ingress and/or egress control blocks of a P4 program. In this demo paper, we propose an AQM evaluation framework in which AQM algorithms described in P4 language can be executed and evaluated with a modified version of our DPDK-based P4 compiler called T4P4S in a testbed with realistic traffic mixes. The framework is demonstrated with some selected AQM algorithms in a network with a 5 Gbps bottleneck."

SwimTrack: Drowning Detection using RFID,"Drowning is a leading cause of unintentional death worldwide. To ensure safe swimming, we introduce SwimTrack, a drowning warning system based on the Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Swimmers only need to wear a wristband equipped with an RFID tag. SwimTrack is a low-cost device, achieving robust, quick drowning detection. The key observation is that the tag will not be readable as soon as the swimmer's hand (with a wristband) goes below the water surface. Our real-world experiments in a swimming pool show that SwimTrack can detect drowning events with an accuracy of 100% over 17 tests."
A Practical Range Encoding Scheme for TCAMs,"TCAMs play a central role in the forwarding plane of physical SDN switches. Despite their capability for line-speed queries, they are not well suited for representing rules with range fields. In this poster, we report our latest work on TCAM range encodings, which is not only better in terms of encoding performance, but also easier to understand and more practical to implement. The preliminary evaluation shows that, our proposed encoding scheme has comparable encoding efficiency to the optimal encoding scheme, while achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement on encoding performance over the optimal encoding scheme on average."

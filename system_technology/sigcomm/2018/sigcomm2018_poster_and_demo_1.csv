A Programmable Framework for Validating Data Planes,"Due to the emerging trend of programmable network hardware, developers have begun to explore ways to accelerate various applications and services. As a result, there is a pressing need for new tools and techniques for debugging network devices. This paper presents NetDebug, a fully programmable hardware-software framework for validating and real-time debugging of programmable data planes. We describe validation use cases, compare our design to alternative solutions, and present a preliminary evaluation using a prototype implementation."
Adaptive Network Security through Stream Machine Learning,"Stream Machine Learning is rapidly gaining popularity within the network monitoring community as the big data produced by network devices and end-user terminals goes beyond the memory constraints of standard monitoring equipment. We consider a stream-based machine learning approach to network security, conceiving adaptive machine learning algorithms for the analysis of continuously evolving network data streams. Using a sliding-window adaptive-size approach, we show that adaptive random forests models are able to keep up with important concept drifts in the underlying network data streams, by keeping high accuracy with continuous re-training at concept drift detection times."
CircuitStart: A Slow Start For Multi-Hop Anonymity Systems,"In order to improve the performance of anonymity networks like Tor, custom transport protocols have been proposed to efficiently deal with the multi-hop nature of such overlay networks. In this work, we tackle the issue of quickly, but safely, ramping up the congestion window during the initial phase of a circuit's lifetime. We propose a tailored startup mechanism called CircuitStart that transfers the idea of a traditional slow start to the multi-hop scenario by effectively compensating potential overshooting, improving performance compared to existing approaches."

Enabling Dense Spatial Reuse in mmWave Networks,"Millimeter Wave (mmWave) networks can deliver multi-Gbps wireless links that use extremely narrow directional beams. This provides us with a new way to exploit spatial reuse in order to scale network throughput. In this work, we present MilliNet, the first millimeter wave network that can exploit dense spatial reuse to allow many links to operate in parallel in a confined space and scale the wireless throughput with the number of clients. Results from a 60 GHz testbed show that MilliNet can deliver a total wireless network data rate of more than 38 Gbps for 10 clients which is 5.8Ã— higher than current 802.11 mmWave standards."

"Fine-Grained, Multi-Domain Network Resource Abstraction as a Fundamental Primitive to Enable High-Performance, Collaborative Data Sciences","Recently, a number of multi-domain network resource information and reservation systems have been developed and deployed, driven by the demand and substantial benefits of providing predictable network resources. A major lacking of such systems, however, is that they are based on coarse-grained or localized information, resulting in substantial inefficiencies. In this paper, we present Explorer, a simple, novel, highly efficient multi-domain network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource information, to support high-performance, collaborative data sciences. The core component of Explorer is the use of linear inequalities, referred to as resource state abstraction (ReSA), as a compact, unifying representation of multi-domain network available bandwidth, which simplifies applications without exposing network details. We develop a ReSA obfuscating protocol and a proactive full-mesh ReSA discovery mechanism to ensure the privacy-preserving and scalability of Explorer. We fully implement Explorer and demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy through extensive experiments using real network topologies and traces."
Flowtree: Enabling Distributed Flow Summarization at Scale,"NetFlow and IPFIX raw flow captures are insightful yet, due to their large volume, challenging to timely analyze and query. In particular, if these captures span long time periods or are collected at remote locations, storing or transferring them for analysis becomes increasingly expensive."
High speed adaptive rack-scale fabrics,"Rack-scale systems contain thousands of densely packed connected components. While a data center may accommodate a fully provisioned network, rack-scale systems demand a more compact and versatile network that would even up within a heavily populated system. Unless the critical path between communicating hosts is made faster, distributed rack-scale applications cannot scale. We present adaptive rack-scale fabrics, an architecture that uses Physical Layer Primitives, coupled with a Closed Ring Control. The resulting fabric uses pre-fetching techniques, but at the physical layer of the interconnect, to optimize performance within strict power-budget limitations."
High-Fidelity Interdomain Routing Experiments,"The PEERING research platform lets researchers exchange actual BGP routes and traffic with hundreds of networks. To date, several researchers have used PEERING to perform interdomain routing experiments. However, PEERING's original design sends experiment data-plane traffic through a VPN, introducing latency and jitter, hindering the applicability of the platform to performance-sensitive experiments. In this work, we propose extensions to PEERING to allow researchers to run applications inside containers on PEERING routers, mitigating performance degradation on data-plane traffic and empowering new classes of experiments. Our goals include strong isolation between experiments and flexible routing to steer traffic in and out of containers."

Modeling IP-to-IP Communication using the Weighted Stochastic Block Model,"The vision of self-driving networks integrates network measurements with network control. Processing data for each of the network control tasks separately might be prohibitive due to the large volume and waste of computational resources. In this work we make the case of using the Weighted Stochastic Block Model (WSBM), a probabilistic model, to learn a task independent representation. In particular, we consider a case study of real-world IP-to-IP communication. The learned representation provides higher level-features for traffic engineering, anomaly detection, or other tasks, and reduces their computational effort. We find that the WSBM is able to accurately model traffic and structure of communication in the considered trace."

Observing Network Handovers with Multipath TCP,"Multipath TCP is a recent TCP extension that enables the usage of multiple networks for a single connection. Since September 2017, Apple has enabled Multipath TCP on iOS11 for all applications. The main dedicated use case of multipath usage resides in network resiliency. We evaluate how the ""interactive"" mode of Multipath TCP behaves under user mobility scenarios using bidirectional constant bit rate traffic. Our results show that the passage from WiFi to cellular is not abrupt, justifying the usage of multiple paths. However, there is still some room for improvement for Multipath TCP in such cases."

Operating a DNS-based Active Internet Observatory,"The Internet is subject to constant evolution. Its improvement requires understanding its current properties, a perspective provided by measurement studies. A key challenge in broadly studying evolution is to i) cover multiple protocols ii) with longitudinal measurements. In this poster, we present an Internet observatory that performs active measurements of multiple protocols (e.g., DNS, HTTP2, QUIC) regularly since 2016. Its measurements cover both i) the entire IPv4 address space and it) > 50% of the domain name space to provide a new perspective on Internet evolution. The goal of this poster is to present its extensible architecture and capabilities, thereby aiming to foster collaboration."

perfbench: A Tool for Predictability Analysis in Multi-Tenant Software-Defined Networks,"Network Virtualization (NV) provides low resource costs and high utilization, while ensuring bandwidth isolation in the data plane. Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are a particularly interesting technology to implement NV, as tenants maintain control over their virtual Software-Defined Networks (vSDNs). However, bandwidth isolation alone may not be enough to provide a predictable application performance in virtual networks, as the virtualization layer itself is another source of potential performance interference. Today, we lack tools that help reveal and investigate such sources of interference and identify performance inefficiencies. In order to fill this gap, we developed a new tool --- perfbench. We report on the tool design and our initial findings."
Polyraptor: Embracing Path and Data Redundancy in Data Centres for Efficient Data Transport,"In this paper, we introduce Polyraptor, a novel data transport protocol that uses RaptorQ (RQ) codes and is tailored for one-to-many and many-to-one data transfer patterns, which are extremely common in modern data centres. Polyraptor builds on previous work on fountain coding-based transport and provides excellent performance, by exploiting native support for multicasting in data centres and data resilience provided by data replication."

RawPower: Deep Learning based Anomaly Detection from Raw Network Traffic Measurements,"Machine learning models using deep architectures (i.e., deep learning) have gained path in recent years and have become state-of-the-art in many fields, including computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. However, when it comes to network measurement and analysis, classic machine learning approaches are commonly used, heavily relying on domain expert knowledge. In this work, we explore the power of deep learning models to perform anomaly detection on network traffic data, taking as input raw measurements coming directly from the stream of monitored bytes. Our initial results suggest that deep learning can enhance anomaly detection without requiring expert domain knowledge to handcraft input features."
Redundant Logic Elimination in Network Functions,"In current NFV ecosystem, most software NFs delivered by NF vendors tend to be monolithic with multiple features. In runtime, an NF is configured with a subset of its features turned on/off. By our code analysis and primary test, we find that some of the (runtime) unused features are executed silently, which wastes CPU cycles and memory. We propose to use program analysis techniques to eliminate runtime redundant logic in NF code so that the NF performance can be accelerated. We prototype our idea and test it on Snort to show the feasibility."
Revealing Hidden Hierarchical Heavy Hitters in network traffic,"The idea to enable advanced in-network monitoring functionality has been lately fostered by the advent of massive data-plane programmability. A specific example includes the detection of traffic aggregates with programmable switches, i.e., heavy hitters. So far, proposed solutions implement the mining process by partitioning the network stream in disjoint windows. This practice allows efficient implementations but comes at a well-known cost: the results are tightly coupled with the traffic and window's characteristics."
Scalable Surface Reconstruction in the Mobile Edge,"Various augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications have emerged in the past years and their popularity are still increasing. Most of these applications work near real-time, posing low-latency requirements against the algorithms to be used. The high computational complexity of 3D mesh generation from continuous 3D point cloud streams provided by depth cameras requires strong processors that have high energy consumption, leading to low battery life of mobile devices. By moving the processing to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, the smart phones can be offloaded and thus their battery life can be extended. In this paper, we propose a highly-scalable method for near real-time 3D mesh generation by exploiting the advances of MEC."
SFP: Toward Interdomain Routing for SDN Networks,"Interdomain routing using BGP is widely deployed and well understood. The deployment of SDN in BGP domain networks, however, has not been systematically studied. In this paper, we first show that the use-announcement inconsistency is a fundamental mismatch in such a deployment, leading to serious issues including unnecessary blackholes, unnecessary reduced reachability, and permanent forwarding loops. We then design SFP, the first fine-grained interdomain routing protocol that extends BGP with fine-grained routing, eliminating the aforementioned mismatch. We develop two novel techniques, automatic receiver filtering and on-demand information dissemination, to address the scalability issue brought by fine-grained routing. Evaluating SFP using real network topologies and traces for intended settings, which are not global Internet but tens of collaborative domains, we show that SFP can reduce the amount of traffic affected by blackholes and loops by more than 50%, and that our proposed techniques can reduce the amount of signaling between ASes by 3 orders of magnitude compared with naive fine-grained routing."

SN-FFC: Improving Survivability of LEO Satellite Network with Forward Fault Correction,"Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellite network will suffer from heavy congestion under network faults such as node failure, which affects its survivability. Traffic engineering is the mechanism to solve such problem. In data-center wide area networks (DCWAN), Forward Fault Correction (FFC), a proactive traffic engineering system, can ensure that the network is free from congestion as long as the number of faults is up to k. Inspired by FFC, we implement SN-FFC in LEO satellite network. We show how SN-FFC can transmit data flows normally in the case of node failures. Our simulation results show that the LEO satellite network and the DCWAN have certain similarities in the fault-tolerance mechanism based on traffic engineering with FFC. Therefore, it can guide us to do more in-depth research in this area."

A Fully Portable TCP Implementation Using XFSMs,"XTRA (XFSM for TRAnsport) is a first step towards ""code-once-port-everywhere"" transport protocols. XTRA's platform-agnostic programming abstraction, based on an extended finite state machine formalization of a desired transport layer task, is amenable not only to SW engines, but can be directly executed in CPU-less custom HW, thus permits to harness FPGA-based NICs' offloading opportunities without any re-coding effort. We experimentally demonstrate that XTRA enables us to port a customized TCP implementation across three completely different environments (HW proof-of-concept on a NetFPGA board, User-space SW over Linux' Open Data Plane, and NS3 emulator)."
A large-scale demonstration of SDN-based handover management in IEEE 802.11 networks,"The density of Wi-Fi at professional environments, such as offices, is resulting in increased strain on the management of Wi-Fi networks, of which handovers are an essential part of. The centralized approach of SDN allows taking more intelligent decisions, as opposed to per device optimizations. There is thus an increased interest in SDN-based Wi-Fi management, especially for handovers. Several proposals for SDN-based handover algorithms are being investigated and there is a need for actually validating them. In this demo, we will showcase a Wi-Fi SDN framework, on top of which a number of decision-making handover algorithms can be used. This framework is used in a real-life, large scale Wi-Fi testbed. The framework allows for different decision-making handover algorithms to be created and validated on large scale."
A practical method for measuring Web above-the-fold time,"Page load time (PLT) is still the most common application Quality of Service (QoS) metric to estimate the Quality of Experience (QoE) of Web users. Yet, recent literature abounds with interesting proposals for alternative metrics (e.g., Above The Fold, SpeedIndex and variants) that aim at closely capturing how users perceive the Webpage rendering process. However, these novel metrics are typically computationally expensive, as they require to monitor and post-process videos of the rendering process, and have failed to be widely deployed."

BB-Gen: A Packet Crafter for P4 Target Evaluation,"With P4 gaining traction to define datapath pipelines along auto-generated control plane APIs, the protocol-independence and increased flexibility add non-trivial hazards when it comes to functional and in-depth performance evaluation. P4-dependent workload traces are needed along automated methods to populate the tables of the datapath under test accordingly. Without proper tools, manual efforts are required for tedious tasks such as creating appropriate PCAP traces, defining the distribution of field values, and inserting entries in the pipeline tables. To this end, we present BB-Gen, a packet crafter and table generator tool that given a P4 application and a corresponding user configuration results in packet and table traces to carry automated performance evaluation tasks. We demonstrate BB-Gen with P4 applications of increasing complexity (from L2 to VXLAN-based Data Center Gateway), using two different multi-architecture backend compilers (MACSAD, T4P4S) and different targets."
Blockchain-based Decentralized Applications meet Multi-Administrative Domain Networking,"Envisioned 5G use cases arise challenges around the realization of inter-domain relationships beyond traditional Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peering, e.g. end-to-end service deployments tailored to specific business needs (a.k.a. slices). Blockchain technologies bring consensus among decentralized non-trusting counterparts as a shared ledger, offering potential approaches for multi-administrative domain networking seeking agile, transparent end-to-end sliceable Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This demo showcases an experimental prototype based on best of breed open source components (e.g., Ethereum, OVS, Neo4j, Ryu/OpenFlowv1.3, ARIA/TOSCA) illustrating blockchain Decentralized Application (DApp) functionalities for life cycle management of multi-administrative domain network services."

Controlling Drones from 5G Networks,"Envisioned 5G applications are key drivers of the evolution of network and cloud architectures. These novel services pose several challenges on the underlying infrastructure in terms of latency, reliability or capacity, just to mention a few. Controlling or coordinating both indoor and outdoor drones from future networks is a potential application with significant importance. Today's technologies addressing network softwarization, such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), enable a novel way to create and provision such services. In this demonstration, we showcase an Industry 4.0 use-case including a local factory equipped with drones and local cloud and network facilities connecting to remote cloud resources. The envisioned service is realized by a Service Function Chain (SFC) consisting of network functions and logical connections between them with special requirements. In addition, the envisioned service is integrated with our multi-domain resource orchestration system and as a result, it can be controlled, deployed and monitored from that framework. The use-case and the demo well illustrate several aspects and challenges which should be addressed by future 5G systems."
Controlling Real Cloud Experiments from BGP to the Server (and Back),"One of the impediments in performing Internet routing research is the lack of infrastructure capable of supporting experiments with both control and realism. Measurement and experimentation platforms provide minimal control over routing, limited connectivity, and restrict what operations are available. Meanwhile, the proprietary nature of routing policies stymies simulations from providing realism."

Overbooking Network Slices End-to-End: Implementation and Demonstration,"The novel network slicing paradigm allows service providers to open their infrastructure to new business players such as vertical industries. In this demo, we showcase the benefits of our proposed end-to-end network slicing orchestration solution that blends together i) an admission control engine able to handle heterogeneous network slice requests, ii) a resource allocation solution across multiple network domains: radio access, edge, transport and core networks and iii) a monitoring, forecasting and dynamic configuration solution that maximizes the statistical multiplexing of network slices resources. Our orchestration solution is operated through a dashboard that allows requesting network slices on-demand, monitors their performance once deployed and displays the achieved multiplexing gain through overbooking."
Policy Injection: A Cloud Dataplane DoS Attack,"Enterprises continue to migrate their services to the cloud on a massive scale, but the increasing attack surface has become a natural target for malevolent actors. We show policy injection, a novel algorithmic complexity attack that enables a tenant to add specially tailored ACLs into the data center fabric to mount a denial-of-service attack through exploiting the built-in security mechanisms of the cloud management systems (CMS). Our insight is that certain ACLs, when fed with special covert packets by an attacker, may be very difficult to evaluate, leading to an exhaustion of cloud resources. We show how a tenant can inject seemingly harmless ACLs into the cloud data plane to abuse an algorithmic deficiency in the most popular cloud hypervisor switch, Open vSwitch, and reduce its effective peak performance by 80--90%, and, in certain cases, denying network access altogether."

Testing IDS using GENESIDS: Realistic Mixed Traffic Generation for IDS Evaluation,"Evaluating signature-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is a necessary but in general difficult task. Often, live or recorded real-world traffic is used. However, real-world network traffic is often hard to come by at larger scale and the few available traces usually do not contain application layer payload. Furthermore, these traces only contain a small amount of malicious traffic, which does not suffice to thoroughly test a NIDS. We solve this problem by proposing a complete stateful traffic generation system that mixes realistic traffic with user definable malicious HTTP traffic with the purpose of evaluating a NIDS. By relying on the Snort syntax for traffic definition, we guarantee a large dataset of realistic up-to-date attack patterns."

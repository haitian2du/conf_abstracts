Control plane compression,"We develop an algorithm capable of compressing large networks into smaller ones with similar control plane behavior: For every stable routing solution in the large, original network, there exists a corresponding solution in the compressed network, and vice versa. Our compression algorithm preserves a wide variety of network properties including reachability, loop freedom, and path length. Consequently, operators may speed up network analysis, based on simulation, emulation, or verification, by analyzing only the compressed network. Our approach is based on a new theory of control plane equivalence. We implement these ideas in a tool called Bonsai and apply it to real and synthetic networks. Bonsai can shrink real networks by over a factor of 5 and speed up analysis by several orders of magnitude."
p4v: practical verification for programmable data planes,"We present the design and implementation of p4v, a practical tool for verifying data planes described using the P4 programming language. The design of p4v is based on classic verification techniques but adds several key innovations including a novel mechanism for incorporating assumptions about the control plane and domain-specific optimizations which are needed to scale to large programs. We present case studies showing that p4v verifies important properties and finds bugs in real-world programs. We conduct experiments to quantify the scalability of p4v on a wide range of additional examples. We show that with just a few hundred lines of control-plane annotations, p4v is able to verify critical safety properties for switch.p4, a program that implements the functionality of on a modern data center switch, in under three minutes."
"Microboxes: high performance NFV with customizable, asynchronous TCP stacks and dynamic subscriptions","Existing network service chaining frameworks are based on a ""packet-centric"" model where each NF in a chain is given every packet for processing. This approach becomes both inefficient and inconvenient for more complex network functions that operate at higher levels of the protocol stack. We propose Microboxes, a novel service chaining abstraction designed to support transport- and application-layer middle-boxes, or even end-system like services. Simply including a TCP stack in an NFV platform is insufficient because there is a wide spectrum of middlebox types-from NFs requiring only simple TCP bytestream reconstruction to full endpoint termination. By exposing a publish/subscribe-based API for NFs to access packets or protocol events as needed, Microboxes eliminates redundant processing across a chain and enables a modular design. Our implementation on a DPDK-based NFV framework can double throughput by consolidating stack operations and provide a 51% throughput gain by customizing TCP processing to the appropriate level."
Debugging P4 programs with vera,"We present Vera, a tool that verifies P4 programs using symbolic execution. Vera automatically uncovers a number of common bugs including parsing/deparsing errors, invalid memory accesses, loops and tunneling errors, among others. Vera can also be used to verify user-specified properties in a novel language we call NetCTL."

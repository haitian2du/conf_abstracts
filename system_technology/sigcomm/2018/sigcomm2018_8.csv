Enabling deep-tissue networking for miniature medical devices,"We present IVN (In-Vivo Networking), a system that enables powering up and communicating with miniature sensors implanted or injected in deep tissues. IVN overcomes fundamental challenges which have prevented past systems from powering up miniature sensors beyond superficial depths. These challenges include the significant signal attenuation caused by bodily tissues and the miniature antennas of the implantable sensors."
Fast millimeter wave beam alignment,"There is much interest in integrating millimeter wave radios (mmWave) into wireless LANs and 5G cellular networks to benefit from their multi-GHz of available spectrum. Yet, unlike existing technologies, e.g., WiFi, mmWave radios require highly directional antennas. Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the transmitter and receiver need to align their beams before they can communicate. Existing systems scan the space to find the best alignment. Such a process has been shown to introduce up to seconds of delay, and is unsuitable for wireless networks where an access point has to quickly switch between users and accommodate mobile clients."
Polymorphic radios: a new design paradigm for ultra-low power communication,"Duty-cycling has emerged as the predominant method for optimizing power consumption of low-power radios, particularly for sensors that transmit sporadically in small bursts. But duty-cycling is a poor fit for applications involving high-rate sensor data from wearable sensors such as IMUs, microphones, and imagers that need to stream data to the cloud to execute sophisticated machine learning models."
Chorus: truly distributed distributed-MIMO,"Distributed MIMO has long been known theoretically to bring large throughput gains to wireless networks. Recent years have seen significant interest and progress in developing practical distributed MIMO systems. However, these systems only distribute the transmission function across the multiple nodes. The control fabric that synchronizes the nodes to a common reference phase still fundamentally requires a single leader that all nodes in the network are capable of hearing."

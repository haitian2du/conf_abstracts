Networking across boundaries: enabling wireless communication through the water-air interface,"We consider the problem of wireless communication across medium boundaries, specifically across the water-air interface. In particular, we are interested in enabling a submerged underwater sensor to directly communicate with an airborne node. Today's communication technologies cannot enable such a communication link. This is because no single type of wireless signal can operate well across different media and most wireless signals reflect back at media boundaries."
In-body backscatter communication and localization,"Backscatter requires zero transmission power, making it a compelling technology for in-body communication and localization. It can significantly reduce the battery requirements (and hence the size) of micro-implants and smart capsules, and enable them to be located on-the-move inside the body. The problem however is that the electrical properties of human tissues are very different from air and vacuum. This creates new challenges for both communication and localization. For example, signals no longer travel along straight lines, which destroys the geometric principles underlying many localization algorithms. Furthermore, the human skin backscatters the signal creating strong interference to the weak in-body backscatter transmission. These challenges make deep-tissue backscatter intrinsically different from backscatter in air or vacuum. This paper introduces ReMix, a new backscatter design that is particularly customized for deep tissue devices. It overcomes interference from the body surface, and localizes the in-body backscatter devices even though the signal travels along crooked paths. We have implemented our design and evaluated it in animal tissues and human phantoms. Our results demonstrate that ReMix delivers efficient communication at an average SNR of 15.2 dB at 1 MHz bandwidth, and has an average localization accuracy of 1.4cm in animal tissues."
PLoRa: a passive long-range data network from ambient LoRa transmissions,"This paper presents PLoRa, an ambient backscatter design that enables long-range wireless connectivity for batteryless IoT devices. PLoRa takes ambient LoRa transmissions as the excitation signals, conveys data by modulating an excitation signal into a new standard LoRa ""chirp"" signal, and shifts this new signal to a different LoRa channel to be received at a gateway faraway. PLoRa achieves this by a holistic RF front-end hardware and software design, including a low-power packet detection circuit, a blind chirp modulation algorithm and a low-power energy management circuit. To form a complete ambient LoRa backscatter network, we integrate a light-weight backscatter signal decoding algorithm with a MAC-layer protocol that work together to make coexistence of PLoRa tags and active LoRa nodes possible in the network. We prototype PLoRa on a four-layer printed circuit board, and test it in various outdoor and indoor environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our prototype PCB PLoRa tag can backscatter an ambient LoRa transmission sent from a nearby LoRa node (20 cm away) to a gateway up to 1.1 km away, and deliver 284 bytes data every 24 minutes indoors, or every 17 minutes outdoors. We also simulate a 28-nm low-power FPGA based prototype whose digital baseband processor achieves 220 Î¼W power consumption."
A measurement study on multi-path TCP with multiple cellular carriers on high speed rails,"Recent advances in high speed rails (HSRs) are propelling the need for acceptable network service in high speed mobility environments. However, previous studies show that the performance of traditional single-path transmission degrades significantly during high speed mobility due to frequent handoff. Multi-path transmission with multiple carriers is a promising way to enhance the performance, because at any time, there is possibly at least one path not suffering a handoff. In this paper, for the first time, we measure multi-path TCP (MPTCP) with two cellular carriers on HSRs with a peak speed of 310km/h. We find a significant difference in handoff time between the two carriers. Moreover, we observe that MPTCP can provide much better performance than TCP in the poorer of the two paths. This indicates that MPTCP's robustness to handoff is much higher than TCP's. However, the efficiency of MPTCP is far from satisfactory. MPTCP performs worse than TCP in the better path most of the time. We find that the low efficiency can be attributed to poor adaptability to frequent handoff by MPTCP's key operations in sub-flow establishment, congestion control and scheduling. Finally, we discuss possible directions for improving MPTCP for such scenarios."

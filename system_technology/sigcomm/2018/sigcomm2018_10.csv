Incentivizing censorship measurements via circumvention,"We present C-Saw, a system that measures Internet censorship by offering data-driven censorship circumvention to users. The adaptive circumvention capability of C-Saw incentivizes users to opt-in by offering small page load times (PLTs). As users crowdsource, the measurement data gets richer, offering greater insights into censorship mechanisms over a wider region, and in turn leading to even better circumvention capabilities. C-Saw incorporates user consent in its design by measuring only those URLs that a user actually visits. Using a cross-platform implementation of C-Saw, we show that it is effective at collecting and disseminating censorship measurements, selecting circumvention approaches, and optimizing user experience. C-Saw improves the average PLT by up to 48% and 63% over Lantern and Tor, respectively. We demonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale deployment of C-Saw with a pilot study."
RADWAN: rate adaptive wide area network,"Fiber optic cables connecting data centers are an expensive but important resource for large organizations. Their importance has driven a conservative deployment approach, with redundancy and reliability baked in at multiple layers. In this work, we take a more aggressive approach and argue for adapting the capacity of fiber optic links based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We investigate this idea by analyzing the SNR of over 8,000 links in an optical backbone for a period of three years. We show that the capacity of 64% of 100 Gbps IP links can be augmented by at least 75 Gbps, leading to an overall capacity gain of over 134 Tbps. Moreover, adapting link capacity to a lower rate can prevent up to 25% of link failures. Our analysis shows that using the same links, we get higher capacity, better availability, and 32% lower cost per gigabit per second. To accomplish this, we propose RADWAN, a traffic engineering system that allows optical links to adapt their rate based on the observed SNR to achieve higher throughput and availability while minimizing the churn during capacity reconfigurations. We evaluate RADWAN using a testbed consisting of 1,540 km fiber with 16 amplifiers and attenuators. We then simulate the throughput gains of RADWAN at scale and compare them to the gains of state-of-the-art traffic engineering systems. Our data-driven simulations show that RADWAN improves the overall network throughput by 40% while also improving the average link availability."
Elastic sketch: adaptive and fast network-wide measurements,"When network is undergoing problems such as congestion, scan attack, DDoS attack, etc., measurements are much more important than usual. In this case, traffic characteristics including available bandwidth, packet rate, and flow size distribution vary drastically, significantly degrading the performance of measurements. To address this issue, we propose the Elastic sketch. It is adaptive to currently traffic characteristics. Besides, it is generic to measurement tasks and platforms. We implement the Elastic sketch on six platforms: P4, FPGA, GPU, CPU, multi-core CPU, and OVS, to process six typical measurement tasks. Experimental results and theoretical analysis show that the Elastic sketch can adapt well to traffic characteristics. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the Elastic sketch achieves 44.6 ∼ 45.2 times faster speed and 2.0 ∼ 273.7 smaller error rate."
Sketchlearn: relieving user burdens in approximate measurement with automated statistical inference,"Network measurement is challenged to fulfill stringent resource requirements in the face of massive network traffic. While approximate measurement can trade accuracy for resource savings, it demands intensive manual efforts to configure the right resource-accuracy trade-offs in real deployment. Such user burdens are caused by how existing approximate measurement approaches inherently deal with resource conflicts when tracking massive network traffic with limited resources. In particular, they tightly couple resource configurations with accuracy parameters, so as to provision sufficient resources to bound the measurement errors. We design SketchLearn, a novel sketch-based measurement framework that resolves resource conflicts by learning their statistical properties to eliminate conflicting traffic components. We prototype SketchLearn on OpenVSwitch and P4, and our testbed experiments and stress-test simulation show that SketchLearn accurately and automatically monitors various traffic statistics and effectively supports network-wide measurement with limited resources."

"Internet anycast: performance, problems, & potential","Internet anycast depends on inter-domain routing to direct clients to their ""closest"" sites. Using data collected from a root DNS server for over a year (400M+ queries/day from 100+ sites), we characterize the load balancing and latency performance of global anycast. Our analysis shows that site loads are often unbalanced, and that most queries travel longer than necessary, many by over 5000 km."
"B4 and after: managing hierarchy, partitioning, and asymmetry for availability and scale in google's software-defined WAN","Private WANs are increasingly important to the operation of enterprises, telecoms, and cloud providers. For example, B4, Google's private software-defined WAN, is larger and growing faster than our connectivity to the public Internet. In this paper, we present the five-year evolution of B4. We describe the techniques we employed to incrementally move from offering best-effort content-copy services to carrier-grade availability, while concurrently scaling B4 to accommodate 100x more traffic. Our key challenge is balancing the tension introduced by hierarchy required for scalability, the partitioning required for availability, and the capacity asymmetry inherent to the construction and operation of any large-scale network. We discuss our approach to managing this tension: i) we design a custom hierarchical network topology for both horizontal and vertical software scaling, ii) we manage inherent capacity asymmetry in hierarchical topologies using a novel traffic engineering algorithm without packet encapsulation, and iii) we re-architect switch forwarding rules via two-stage matching/hashing to deal with asymmetric network failures at scale."
"On low-latency-capable topologies, and their impact on the design of intra-domain routing","An ISP's customers increasingly demand delivery of their traffic without congestion and with low latency. The ISP's topology, routing, and traffic engineering, often over multiple paths, together determine congestion and latency within its backbone. We first consider how to measure a topology's capacity to route traffic without congestion and with low latency. We introduce low-latency path diversity (LLPD), a metric that captures a topology's flexibility to accommodate traffic on alternative low-latency paths. We explore to what extent 116 real backbone topologies can, regardless of routing system, keep latency low when demand exceeds the shortest path's capacity. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that topologies with good LLPD are precisely those where routing schemes struggle to achieve low latency without congestion. We examine why these schemes perform poorly, and offer an existence proof that a practical routing scheme can achieve a topology's potential for congestion-free, low-delay routing. Finally we examine implications for the design of backbone topologies amenable to achieving high capacity and low delay."
Asynchronous convergence of policy-rich distributed bellman-ford routing protocols,We present new results in the theory of asynchronous convergence for the Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) family of routing protocols which includes distance-vector protocols (e.g. RIP) and path-vector protocols (e.g. BGP). We take the strictly increasing conditions of Sobrinho and make three main new contributions.

WebPerf: Evaluating What-If Scenarios for Cloud-hosted Web Applications,"Developers deploying web applications in the cloud often need to determine how changes such as service tiers or runtime loads may affect user-perceived page load time. We devise and evaluate a systematic methodology for exploring such ""what-if"" questions at the time a web application is deployed. Given a website, a web request, and “whatif” scenario, with a hypothetical configuration and runtime condition, our methodology, embedded in a system called WebPerf, can estimate a distribution of end-to-end response times for the request under the “what-if” scenario. WebPerf makes three contributions: (1) automated instrumentation of web sites written with increasingly popular task parallel libraries, to capture causal call dependencies of various computation and asynchronous I/O calls; (2) an algorithm to use the call dependencies, together with online- and offlineprofiled models of various I/O calls to estimate a distribution of end-to-end latency of the request; and (3) an algorithm to optimize modeling errors by deciding how many measurements to take within a limited time. We have implemented WebPerf for Microsoft Azure. Our experiments with five real websites and seven scenarios show that the median error of WebPerf’s estimation is within 7% for all applications and scenarios."
CS2P: Improving Video Bitrate Selection and Adaptation with Data-Driven Throughput Prediction,"Bitrate adaptation is critical in ensuring good users’ quality-of-experience (QoE) in Internet video delivery system. Several efforts have argued that accurate throughput prediction can dramatically improve (1) initial bitrate selection for low startup delay and high initial resolution; (2) midstream bitrate adaptation for high QoE. However, prior ef- forts did not systematically quantify real-world throughput predictability or develop good prediction algorithms. To bridge this gap, this paper makes three key technical contributions: First, we analyze the throughput characteristics in a dataset with 20M+ sessions. We find: (a) Sessions sharing similar key features (e.g., ISP, region) present similar initial values and dynamical patterns; (b) There is a natural “stateful” dynamical behavior within a given session. Second, building on these insights, we develop CS2P, a better throughput prediction system. CS2P leverages data-driven approach to learn (a) clusters of similar sessions, (b) an initial throughput predictor, and (c) a Hidden-Markov-Model based midstream predictor modeling the stateful evolution of throughput. Third, we develop a prototype system and show by trace-driven simulation and real-world experiments that CS2P outperforms state-of-art by 40% and 50% median pre- diction error respectively for initial and midstream through- put and improves QoE by 14% over buffer-based adaptation algorithm."
Via: Improving Internet Telephony Call Quality Using Predictive Relay Selection,"Interactive real-time streaming applications such as audio-video conferencing, online gaming and app streaming, place stringent requirements on the network in terms of delay, jitter, and packet loss. Many of these applications inherently involve client-to-client communication, which is particularly challenging since the performance requirements need to be met while traversing the public wide-area network (WAN). This is different from the typical situation of cloud-to-client communication, where the WAN can often be bypassed by moving a communication end-point to a cloud “edge”, close to the client. Can we nevertheless take advantage of cloud resources to improve the performance of real-time client-to-client streaming over the WAN?"

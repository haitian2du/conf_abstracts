Evolve or Die: High-Availability Design Principles Drawn from Googles Network Infrastructure,"Maintaining the highest levels of availability for content providers is challenging in the face of scale, network evolution and complexity. Little, however, is known about failures large content providers are susceptible to, and what mechanisms they employ to ensure high availability. From a detailed analysis of over 100 high-impact failure events in a global-scale content provider encompassing several data centers and two WANs, we quantify several dimensions of availability failures. We find that failures are evenly distributed across different network types and planes, but that a large number of failures happen when a management operation is in progress within the network. We discuss some of these failures in detail, and also describe our design principles for high availability motivated by these failures, including using defense in depth, maintaining consistency across planes, failing open on large failures, carefully preventing and avoiding failures, and assessing root cause quickly. Our findings suggest that, as networks become more complicated, failures lurk everywhere, and, counter-intuitively, continuous incremental evolution of the network can, when applied together with our design principles, result in a more robust network."
Dynamic Pricing and Traffic Engineering for Timely Inter-Datacenter Transfers,"Neither traffic engineering nor fixed prices (e.g., \$/GB) alone fully address the challenges of highly utilized inter-datacenter WANs. The former offers more service to users who overstate their demands and poor service overall. The latter offers no service guarantees to customers, and providers have no lever to steer customer demand to lightly loaded paths/times. To address these issues, we design and evaluate Pretium -- a framework that combines dynamic pricing with traffic engineering for inter-datacenter bandwidth. In Pretium, users specify their required rates or transfer sizes with deadlines, and a price module generates a price quote for different guarantees (promises) on these requests. The price quote is generated using internal prices (which can vary over time and links) which are maintained and periodically updated by Pretium based on history. A supplementary schedule adjustment module gears the agreed-upon network transfers towards an efficient operating point by optimizing time-varying operation costs. Experiments using traces from a large production WAN show that Pretium improves total system efficiency (value of routed transfers minus operation costs) by more than 3.5X relative to current usage-based pricing schemes, while increasing the provider profits by 2X."
Optimizing Bulk Transfers with Software-Defined Optical WAN,"Bulk transfer on the wide-area network (WAN) is a fundamental service to many globally-distributed applications. It is challenging to efficiently utilize expensive WAN bandwidth to achieve short transfer completion time and meet mission-critical deadlines. Advancements in software-defined networking (SDN) and optical hardware make it feasible and beneficial to quickly reconfigure optical devices in the optical layer, which brings a new opportunity for traffic management on the WAN."

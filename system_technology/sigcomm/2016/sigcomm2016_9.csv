Robotron: Top-down Network Management at Facebook Scale,"Network management facilitates a healthy and sustainable network. However, its practice is not well understood outside the network engineering community. In this paper, we present Robotron, a system for managing a massive production network in a top-down fashion. The system's goal is to reduce effort and errors on management tasks by minimizing direct human interaction with network devices. Engineers use Robotron to express high-level design intent, which is translated into low-level device configurations and deployed safely. Robotron also monitors devices' operational state to ensure it does not deviate from the desired state. Since 2008, Robotron has been used to manage tens of thousands of network devices connecting hundreds of thousands of servers globally at Facebook."
Taking the Blame Game out of Data Centers Operations with NetPoirot,"Today, root cause analysis of failures in data centers is mostly done through manual inspection. More often than not, cus- tomers blame the network as the culprit. However, other components of the system might have caused these failures. To troubleshoot, huge volumes of data are collected over the entire data center. Correlating such large volumes of diverse data collected from different vantage points is a daunting task even for the most skilled technicians. In this paper, we revisit the question: how much can you infer about a failure in the data center using TCP statistics collected at one of the endpoints? Using an agent that cap- tures TCP statistics we devised a classification algorithm that identifies the root cause of failure using this information at a single endpoint. Using insights derived from this classi- fication algorithm we identify dominant TCP metrics that indicate where/why problems occur in the network. We val- idate and test these methods using data that we collect over a period of six months in a production data center."
Globally Synchronized Time via Datacenter Networks,"In this paper, we present Datacenter Time Protocol (DTP), a clock synchronization protocol that does not use packets at all, but is able to achieve nanosecond precision. In essence, DTP uses the physical layer of network devices to implement a decentralized clock synchronization protocol. By doing so, DTP eliminates most non-deterministic elements in clock synchronization protocols. Further, DTP uses control messages in the physical layer for communicating hundreds of thousands of protocol messages without interfering with higher layer packets. Thus, DTP has virtually zero overhead since it does not add load at layers 2 or higher layers. It does require replacing network devices, which can be done incrementally. We demonstrate that the precision provided by DTP is bounded by 25.6 nanoseconds for directly connected nodes, and in general, is bounded by 4TD where D is the longest distance between any two servers in a network in terms of number of hops and T is the period of the fastest clock (≈ 6.4ns). Moreover, in software, a DTP daemon can access the DTP clock with usually better than 4T (≈ 25.6ns) precision. As a result, the end-to-end precision can be better than 4T D + 8T nanoseconds. By contrast, the precision of the state of the art protocol is not bounded: The precision is hundreds of nanoseconds when a network is idle and can decrease to hundreds of microseconds when a network is heavily congested."

"PBE-CC: Congestion Control via Endpoint-Centric, Physical-Layer Bandwidth Measurements","Cellular networks are becoming ever more sophisticated and overcrowded, imposing the most delay, jitter, and throughput damage to end-to-end network flows in today's internet. We therefore argue for fine-grained mobile endpoint-based wireless measurements to inform a precise congestion control algorithm through a well-defined API to the mobile's cellular physical layer. Our proposed congestion control algorithm is based on Physical-Layer Bandwidth measurements taken at the Endpoint (PBE-CC), and captures the latest 5G New Radio innovations that increase wireless capacity, yet create abrupt rises and falls in available wireless capacity that the PBE-CC sender can react to precisely and rapidly. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the PBE measurement module on software-defined radios and the PBE sender and receiver in C. An extensive performance evaluation compares PBE-CC head to head against the cellular-aware and wireless-oblivious congestion control protocols proposed in the research community and in deployment, in mobile and static mobile scenarios, and over busy and idle networks. Results show 6.3% higher average throughput than BBR, while simultaneously reducing 95th percentile delay by 1.8x."
Akamai DNS: Providing Authoritative Answers to the World's Queries,"We present Akamai DNS, one of the largest authoritative DNS infrastructures in the world, that supports the Akamai content delivery network (CDN) as well as authoritative DNS hosting and DNS-based load balancing services for many enterprises. As the starting point for a significant fraction of the world's Internet interactions, Akamai DNS serves millions of queries each second and must be resilient to avoid disrupting myriad online services, scalable to meet the ever increasing volume of DNS queries, performant to prevent user-perceivable performance degradation, and reconfigurable to react quickly to shifts in network conditions and attacks. We outline the design principles and architecture used to achieve Akamai DNS's goals, relating the design choices to the system workload and quantifying the effectiveness of those designs. Further, we convey insights from operating the production system that are of value to the broader research community."
"Understanding Operational 5G: A First Measurement Study on Its Coverage, Performance and Energy Consumption","5G, as a monumental shift in cellular communication technology, holds tremendous potential for spurring innovations across many vertical industries, with its promised multi-Gbps speed, sub-10 ms low latency, and massive connectivity. On the other hand, as 5G has been deployed for only a few months, it is unclear how well and whether 5G can eventually meet its prospects. In this paper, we demystify operational 5G networks through a first-of-its-kind cross-layer measurement study. Our measurement focuses on four major perspectives: (i) Physical layer signal quality, coverage and hand-off performance; (ii) End-to-end throughput and latency; (iii) Quality of experience of 5G's niche applications (e.g., 4K/5.7K panoramic video telephony); (iv) Energy consumption on smartphones. The results reveal that the 5G link itself can approach Gbps throughput, but legacy TCP leads to surprisingly low capacity utilization (< 32%), latency remains too high to support tactile applications and power consumption escalates to 2 - 3x over 4G. Our analysis suggests that the wireline paths, upper-layer protocols, computing and radio hardware architecture need to co-evolve with 5G to form an ecosystem, in order to fully unleash its potential."
Caching with Delayed Hits,"Caches are at the heart of latency-sensitive systems. In this paper, we identify a growing challenge for the design of latency-minimizing caches called delayed hits. Delayed hits occur at high throughput, when multiple requests to the same object queue up before an outstanding cache miss is resolved. This effect increases latencies beyond the predictions of traditional caching models and simulations; in fact, caching algorithms are designed as if delayed hits simply didn't exist. We show that traditional caching strategies -- even so called 'optimal' algorithms -- can fail to minimize latency in the presence of delayed hits. We design a new, latency-optimal offline caching algorithm called belatedly which reduces average latencies by up to 45% compared to the traditional, hit-rate optimal Belady's algorithm. Using belatedly as our guide, we show that incorporating an object's 'aggregate delay' into online caching heuristics can improve latencies for practical caching systems by up to 40%. We implement a prototype, Minimum-AggregateDelay (mad), within a CDN caching node. Using a CDN production trace and backends deployed in different geographic locations, we show that mad can reduce latencies by 12-18% depending on the backend RTTs."
Swift: Delay is Simple and Effective for Congestion Control in the Datacenter,"We report on experiences with Swift congestion control in Google datacenters. Swift targets an end-to-end delay by using AIMD control, with pacing under extreme congestion. With accurate RTT measurement and care in reasoning about delay targets, we find this design is a foundation for excellent performance when network distances are well-known. Importantly, its simplicity helps us to meet operational challenges. Delay is easy to decompose into fabric and host components to separate concerns, and effortless to deploy and maintain as a congestion signal while the datacenter evolves. In large-scale testbed experiments, Swift delivers a tail latency of <50Î¼s for short RPCs, with near-zero packet drops, while sustaining ~100Gbps throughput per server. This is a tail of <3x the minimal latency at a load close to 100%. In production use in many different clusters, Swift achieves consistently low tail completion times for short RPCs, while providing high throughput for long RPCs. It has loss rates that are at least 10x lower than a DCTCP protocol, and handles O(10k) incasts that sharply degrade with DCTCP."
Zero Downtime Release: Disruption-free Load Balancing of a Multi-Billion User Website,"Modern network infrastructure has evolved into a complex organism to satisfy the performance and availability requirements for the billions of users. Frequent releases such as code upgrades, bug fixes and security updates have become a norm. Millions of globally distributed infrastructure components including servers and load-balancers are restarted frequently from multiple times per-day to per-week. However, every release brings possibilities of disruptions as it can result in reduced cluster capacity, disturb intricate interaction of the components operating at large scales and disrupt the end-users by terminating their connections. The challenge is further complicated by the scale and heterogeneity of supported services and protocols."
A Computational Approach to Packet Classification,"Multi-field packet classification is a crucial component in modern software-defined data center networks. To achieve high throughput and low latency, state-of-the-art algorithms strive to fit the rule lookup data structures into on-die caches; however, they do not scale well with the number of rules."
Server-Driven Video Streaming for Deep Learning Inference,"Video streaming is crucial for AI applications that gather videos from sources to servers for inference by deep neural nets (DNNs). Unlike traditional video streaming that optimizes visual quality, this new type of video streaming permits aggressive compression/pruning of pixels not relevant to achieving high DNN inference accuracy. However, much of this potential is left unrealized, because current video streaming protocols are driven by the video source (camera) where the compute is rather limited. We advocate that the video streaming protocol should be driven by real-time feedback from the server-side DNN. Our insight is two-fold: (1) server-side DNN has more context about the pixels that maximize its inference accuracy; and (2) the DNN's output contains rich information useful to guide video streaming. We present DDS (DNN-Driven Streaming), a concrete design of this approach. DDS continuously sends a low-quality video stream to the server; the server runs the DNN to determine where to re-send with higher quality to increase the inference accuracy. We find that compared to several recent baselines on multiple video genres and vision tasks, DDS maintains higher accuracy while reducing bandwidth usage by upto 59% or improves accuracy by upto 9% with no additional bandwidth usage."
bf4: towards bug-free P4 programs,"Recent verification work has made advances in finding bugs in P4 programs before deployment, but it requires that the programmer specifies table rules that are possible at runtime[32, 24, 27]. This imposes a specification burden on the programmer, while at the same time failing to guarantee that bugs will not be inserted at runtime by faulty controllers."
Come as You Are: Helping Unmodified Clients Bypass Censorship with Server-side Evasion,"Decades of work on censorship evasion have resulted in myriad ways to empower clients with the ability to access censored content, but to our knowledge all of them have required some degree of client-side participation. Having to download and run anti-censorship software can put users at risk, and does not help the many users who do not even realize they are being censored in the first place."
"Accuracy, Scalability, Coverage: A Practical Configuration Verifier on a Global WAN","This paper presents Hoyan-- the first reported large scale deployment of configuration verification in a global-scale wide area network (WAN). Hoyan has been running in production for more than two years and is currently used for all critical configuration auditing and updates on the WAN. We highlight our innovative designs and real-life experience to make Hoyan accurate and scalable in practice. For accuracy under the inconsistencies of devices' vendor-specific behaviors (VSBs), Hoyan continuously discovers the flaws in device behavior models, thus aiding the operators in fixing the models. For scalability to verify our global WAN, Hoyan introduces a ""global-simulation & local formal-modeling"" strategy to model uncertainties in small scales and perform aggressive pruning of possibilities during the protocol simulations. Hoyan achieves near-100% verification accuracy after it detected and fixed O(10) VSBs on our WAN. Hoyan has prevented many potential service failures resulting from misconfiguration and reduced the failure rate of updates of our WAN by more than half in 2019."
PCC Proteus: Scavenger Transport And Beyond,"Many Internet applications need high bandwidth but are not time sensitive. This motivates a congestion control ""scavenger"" that voluntarily yields to higher-priority applications, thus improving overall user experience. However, the existing scavenger protocol, LEDBAT, often fails to yield, has performance shortcomings, and requires a codebase separate from other transport protocols."
Classic Meets Modern: a Pragmatic Learning-Based Congestion Control for the Internet,"These days, taking the revolutionary approach of using clean-slate learning-based designs to completely replace the classic congestion control schemes for the Internet is gaining popularity. However, we argue that current clean-slate learning-based techniques bring practical issues and concerns such as overhead, convergence issues, and low performance over unseen network conditions to the table. To address these issues, we take a pragmatic and evolutionary approach combining classic congestion control strategies and advanced modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques and introduce a novel hybrid congestion control for the Internet named Orca1. Through extensive experiments done over global testbeds on the Internet and various locally emulated network conditions, we demonstrate that Orca is adaptive and achieves consistent high performance in different network conditions, while it can significantly alleviate the issues and problems of its clean-slate learning-based counterparts."
A Low Latency and Consistent Cellular Control Plane,"5G networks aim to provide ultra-low latency and higher reliability to support emerging and near real-time applications such as augmented and virtual reality, remote surgery, self-driving cars, and multi-player online gaming. This imposes new requirements on the design of cellular core networks. A key component of the cellular core is the control plane. Time to complete control plane operations (e.g. mobility handoff, service establishment) directly impacts the delay experienced by end-user applications. In this paper, we design Neutrino, a cellular control plane that provides users an abstraction of reliable access to cellular services while ensuring lower latency. Our testbed evaluations based on real cellular control traffic traces show that Neutrino provides an improvement in control procedure completion times by up to 3.1x without failures, and up to 5.6x under control plane failures, over existing cellular core proposals. We also show how these improvements translate into improving end-user application performance: for AR/VR applications and self-driving cars, Neutrino performs up to 2.5x and up to 2.8x better, respectively, as compared to existing EPC."
PINT: Probabilistic In-band Network Telemetry,"Commodity network devices support adding in-band telemetry measurements into data packets, enabling a wide range of applications, including network troubleshooting, congestion control, and path tracing. However, including such information on packets adds significant overhead that impacts both flow completion times and application-level performance."
SmartNIC Performance Isolation with FairNIC: Programmable Networking for the Cloud,"Multiple vendors have recently released SmartNICs that provide both special-purpose accelerators and programmable processing cores that allow increasingly sophisticated packet processing tasks to be offloaded from general-purpose CPUs. Indeed, leading data-center operators have designed and deployed SmartNICs at scale to support both network virtualization and application-specific tasks. Unfortunately, cloud providers have not yet opened up the full power of these devices to tenants, as current runtimes do not provide adequate isolation between individual applications running on the SmartNICs themselves."
NFC+: Breaking NFC Networking Limits through Resonance Engineering,"Current UHF RFID systems suffer from two long-standing problems: 1) miss-reading non-line-of-sight or misoriented tags and 2) cross-reading undesired, distant tags due to multi-path reflections. This paper proposes a novel system, NFC+, to overcome the fundamental challenges. NFC+ is a magnetic field reader, which can inventory standard NFC tagged objects with a reasonably long range and arbitrary orientation. NFC+ achieves this by leveraging physical and algorithmic techniques based on magnetic resonance engineering. We build a prototype of NFC+ and conduct extensive evaluations in a logistic network. Comparing to UHF RFID, we find that NFC+ can reduce the miss-reading rate from 23% to 0.03%, and cross-reading rate from 42% to 0, for randomly oriented objects. NFC+ demonstrates high robustness for RFID unfriendly media (e.g., water bottles and metal cans). It can reliably read commercial NFC tags at a distance of up to 3 meters which, for the first time, enables NFC to be directly applied to practical logistics network applications."
1RMA: Re-envisioning Remote Memory Access for Multi-tenant Datacenters,"Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) plays a key role in supporting performance-hungry datacenter applications. However, existing RDMA technologies are ill-suited to multi-tenant datacenters, where applications run at massive scales, tenants require isolation and security, and the workload mix changes over time. Our experiences seeking to operationalize RDMA at scale indicate that these ills are rooted in standard RDMA's basic design attributes: connectionorientedness and complex policies baked into hardware."
Ultra-Wideband Underwater Backscatter via Piezoelectric Metamaterials,"We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of U2B, a technology that enables ultra-wideband backscatter in underwater environments. At the core of U2B's design is a novel metamaterialinspired transducer for underwater backscatter, and algorithms that enable self-interference cancellation and FDMA-based medium access control."
Annulus: A Dual Congestion Control Loop for Datacenter and WAN Traffic Aggregates,"Cloud services are deployed in datacenters connected though high-bandwidth Wide Area Networks (WANs). We find that WAN traffic negatively impacts the performance of datacenter traffic, increasing tail latency by 2.5x, despite its small bandwidth demand. This behavior is caused by the long round-trip time (RTT) for WAN traffic, combined with limited buffering in datacenter switches. The long WAN RTT forces datacenter traffic to take the full burden of reacting to congestion. Furthermore, datacenter traffic changes on a faster time-scale than the WAN RTT, making it difficult for WAN congestion control to estimate available bandwidth accurately."
Probabilistic Verification of Network Configurations,"Not all important network properties need to be enforced all the time. Often, what matters instead is the fraction of time / probability these properties hold. Computing the probability of a property in a network relying on complex inter-dependent routing protocols is challenging and requires determining all failure scenarios for which the property is violated. Doing so at scale and accurately goes beyond the capabilities of current network analyzers."
Beyond the mega-data center: networking multi-data center regions,"The difficulty of building large data centers in dense metro areas is pushing big cloud providers towards a different approach to scaling: multiple smaller data centers within tens of kilometers of each other, comprising a ""region"". We show that networking this small number of nearby sites with each other is a surprisingly challenging and multi-faceted problem. We draw out the operational goals and constraints of such networks, and highlight the design trade-offs involved using data from Microsoft Azure's regions."
Sirius: A Flat Datacenter Network with Nanosecond Optical Switching,"The increasing gap between the growth of datacenter traffic and electrical switch capacity is expected to worsen due to the slowdown of Moore's law, motivating the need for a new switching technology for the post-Moore's law era that can meet the increasingly stringent requirements of hardware-driven cloud workloads. We propose Sirius, an optically-switched network for datacenters providing the abstraction of a single, high-radix switch that can connect thousands of nodes---racks or servers---in a datacenter while achieving nanosecond-granularity reconfiguration. At its core, Sirius uses a combination of tunable lasers and simple, passive gratings that route light based on its wavelength. Sirius' switching technology and topology is tightly codesigned with its routing and scheduling and with novel congestion-control and time-synchronization mechanisms to achieve a scalable yet flat network that can offer high bandwidth and very low end-to-end latency. Through a small-scale prototype using a custom tunable laser chip that can tune in less than 912 ps, we demonstrate 3.84 ns end-to-end reconfiguration atop 50 Gbps channels. Through large-scale simulations, we show that Sirius can approximate the performance of an ideal, electrically-switched non-blocking network with up to 74-77% lower power."

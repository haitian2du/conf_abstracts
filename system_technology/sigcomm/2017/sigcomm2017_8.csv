Empowering Low-Power Wide Area Networks in Urban Settings,"Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) are an attractive emerging platform to connect the Internet-of-things. LP-WANs enable low-cost devices with a 10-year battery to communicate at few kbps to a base station, kilometers away. But deploying LP-WANs in large urban environments is challenging, given the sheer density of nodes that causes interference, coupled with attenuation from buildings that limits signal range. Yet, state-of-the-art techniques to address these limitations demand inordinate hardware complexity at the base stations or clients, increasing their size and cost."
Wi-Fi Goes to Town: Rapid Picocell Switching for Wireless Transit Networks,"This paper presents the design and implementation of Wi-Fi Goes to Town, the first Wi-Fi based roadside hotspot network designed to operate at vehicular speeds with meter-sized picocells. Wi-Fi Goes to Town APs make delivery decisions to the vehicular clients they serve at millisecond-level granularities, exploiting path diversity in roadside networks. In order to accomplish this, we introduce new buffer management algorithms that allow participating APs to manage each others' queues, rapidly quenching each others' transmissions and flushing each others' queues. We furthermore integrate our fine-grained AP selection and queue management into 802.11's frame aggregation and block acknowledgement functions, making the system effective at modern 802.11 bit rates that need frame aggregation to maintain high spectral efficiency. We have implemented our system in an eight-AP network alongside a nearby road, and evaluate its performance with mobile clients moving at up to 35 mph. Depending on the clients' speed, Wi-Fi Goes to Town achieves a 2.4-4.7x TCP throughput improvement over a baseline fast handover protocol that captures the state of the art in Wi-Fi roaming, including the recent IEEE 802.11k and 802.11r standards."
Drone Relays for Battery-Free Networks,"Battery-free sensors, such as RFIDs, are annually attached to billions of items including pharmaceutical drugs, clothes, and manufacturing parts. The fundamental challenge with battery-free sensors is that they are only reliable at short distances of tens of centimeters to few meters. As a result, today's systems for communicating with and localizing battery-free sensors are crippled by the limited range."
A High Performance Packet Core for Next Generation Cellular Networks,"Cellular traffic continues to grow rapidly making the scalability of the cellular infrastructure a critical issue. However, there is mounting evidence that the current Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is ill-suited to meet these scaling demands: EPC solutions based on specialized appliances are expensive to scale and recent software EPCs perform poorly, particularly with increasing numbers of devices or signaling traffic."

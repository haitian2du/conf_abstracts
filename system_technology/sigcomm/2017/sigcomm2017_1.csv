dRMT: Disaggregated Programmable Switching,"We present dRMT (disaggregated Reconfigurable Match-Action Table), a new architecture for programmable switches. dRMT overcomes two important restrictions of RMT, the predominant pipeline-based architecture for programmable switches: (1) table memory is local to an RMT pipeline stage, implying that memory not used by one stage cannot be reclaimed by another, and (2) RMT is hardwired to always sequentially execute matches followed by actions as packets traverse pipeline stages. We show that these restrictions make it difficult to execute programs efficiently on RMT."
SilkRoad: Making Stateful Layer-4 Load Balancing Fast and Cheap Using Switching ASICs,"In this paper, we show that up to hundreds of software load balancer (SLB) servers can be replaced by a single modern switching ASIC, potentially reducing the cost of load balancing by over two orders of magnitude. Today, large data centers typically employ hundreds or thousands of servers to load-balance incoming traffic over application servers. These software load balancers (SLBs) map packets destined to a service (with a virtual IP address, or VIP), to a pool of servers tasked with providing the service (with multiple direct IP addresses, or DIPs). An SLB is stateful, it must always map a connection to the same server, even if the pool of servers changes and/or if the load is spread differently across the pool. This property is called per-connection consistency or PCC. The challenge is that the load balancer must keep track of millions of connections simultaneously."
Re-architecting datacenter networks and stacks for low latency and high performance,"Modern datacenter networks provide very high capacity via redundant Clos topologies and low switch latency, but transport protocols rarely deliver matching performance. We present NDP, a novel data-center transport architecture that achieves near-optimal completion times for short transfers and high flow throughput in a wide range of scenarios, including incast. NDP switch buffers are very shallow and when they fill the switches trim packets to headers and priority forward the headers. This gives receivers a full view of instantaneous demand from all senders, and is the basis for our novel, high-performance, multipath-aware transport protocol that can deal gracefully with massive incast events and prioritize traffic from different senders on RTT timescales. We implemented NDP in Linux hosts with DPDK, in a software switch, in a NetFPGA-based hardware switch, and in P4. We evaluate NDP's performance in our implementations and in large-scale simulations, simultaneously demonstrating support for very low-latency and high throughput."

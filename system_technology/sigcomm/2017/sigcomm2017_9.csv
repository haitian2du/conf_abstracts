Understanding and Mitigating Packet Corruption in Data Center Networks,"We take a comprehensive look at packet corruption in data center networks, which leads to packet losses and application performance degradation. By studying 350K links across 15 production data centers, we find that the extent of corruption losses is significant and that its characteristics differ markedly from congestion losses. Corruption impacts fewer links than congestion, but imposes a heavier loss rate; and unlike congestion, corruption rate on a link is stable over time and is not correlated with its utilization."
Who is Fiddling with Prices?: Building and Deploying a Watchdog Service for E-commerce,"We present the design, implementation, validation, and deployment of the Price Sheriff, a highly distributed system for detecting various types of online price discrimination in e-commerce. The Price Sheriff uses a peer-to-peer architecture, sandboxing, and secure multiparty computation to allow users to tunnel price check requests through the browsers of other peers without tainting their local or server-side browsing history and state. Having operated the Price Sheriff for several months with approximately one thousand real users, we identify several instances of cross-border price discrimination based on the country of origin. Even within national borders, we identify several retailers that return different prices for the same product to different users. We examine whether the observed differences are due to personal-data-induced discrimination or A/B testing, and conclude that it is the latter."
Vroom: Accelerating the Mobile Web with Server-Aided Dependency Resolution,"The existing slowness of the web on mobile devices frustrates users and hurts the revenue of website providers. Prior studies have attributed high page load times to dependencies within the page load process: network latency in fetching a resource delays its processing, which in turn delays when dependent resources can be discovered and fetched."
Carousel: Scalable Traffic Shaping at End Hosts,"Traffic shaping, including pacing and rate limiting, is fundamental to the correct and efficient operation of both datacenter and wide area networks. Sample use cases include policy-based bandwidth allocation to flow aggregates, rate-based congestion control algorithms, and packet pacing to avoid bursty transmissions that can overwhelm router buffers. Driven by the need to scale to millions of flows and to apply complex policies, traffic shaping is moving from network switches into the end hosts, typically implemented in software in the kernel networking stack."

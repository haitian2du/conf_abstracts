Low-Congestion Shortcuts without Embedding,"Distributed optimization algorithms are frequently faced with solving sub-problems on disjoint connected parts of a network. Unfortunately, the diameter of these parts can be significantly larger than the diameter of the underlying network, leading to slow running times. Recent work by [Ghaffari and Hauepler; SODA'16] showed that this phenomenon can be seen as the broad underlying reason for the pervasive Omega(√n + D) lower bounds that apply to most optimization problems in the CONGEST model. On the positive side, this work also introduced low-congestion shortcuts as an elegant solution to circumvent this problem in certain topologies of interest. Particularly, they showed that there exist good shortcuts for any planar network and more generally any bounded genus network. This directly leads to fast O(DlogO(1)n) distributed optimization algorithms on such topologies, e.g., for MST and Min-Cut approximation, given that one can efficiently construct these shortcuts in a distributed manner."
The Coalescing-Branching Random Walk on Expanders and the Dual Epidemic Process,"Information propagation on graphs is a fundamental topic in distributed computing. One of the simplest models of information propagation is the push protocol in which at each round each agent independently pushes the current knowledge to a random neighbour. In this paper we study the so-called coalescing-branching random walk (COBRA), in which each vertex pushes the information to k randomly selected neighbours and then stops passing information until it receives the information again. The aim of COBRA is to propagate information fast but with a limited number of transmissions per vertex per step. In this paper we study the cover time of the COBRA process defined as the minimum time until each vertex has received the information at least once. Our main result says that if G is an n-vertex r-regular graph whose transition matrix has second eigenvalue λ, then the COBRA cover time of G is O(log n), if 1-λ is greater than a positive constant, and O((log n)/(1-λ)3)), if 1-λ >> √log (i>n)/n}. These bounds are independent of r and hold for 3 ≤ r ≤ n-1. They improve the previous bound of O(log2n) for expander graphs [Dutta et al., SPAA 2013]."
Ant-Inspired Density Estimation via Random Walks: Extended Abstract,"Many ant species employ distributed population density estimation in applications ranging from quorum sensing [21], to task allocation [9], to appraisal of enemy colony strength [1]. It has been shown that ants estimate density by tracking encounter rates -- the higher the population density, the more often the ants bump into each other [21,10]."
Brief Announcement: Multi-Broadcasting under the SINR Model,"We study the multi-broadcast problem in multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, under the SINR model, deployed in the 2D Euclidean plane. In multi-broadcast, there are $k$ initial messages, potentially belonging to different nodes, that must be forwarded to all $n$ nodes of the network. We present deterministic algorithms for multi-broadcast for the different settings reflecting the different types of knowledge, about the topology of the network, available to the nodes: (i) the whole network topology (ii) their own coordinates and coordinates of their neighbors (iii) only their own physical coordinates (iv) only their own ids and the ids of their neighbors, but not actual physical co-ordinates. The last result is specially interesting, as it is the first deterministic protocol, for the SINR model, that does not require nodes to know their coordinates in the plane (a very specialized type of knowledge), but intricately exploits the fact that they lie on a two dimensional plane."
Brief Announcement: Using Read-k Inequalities to Analyze a Distributed MIS Algorithm,"Until recently, the fastest distributed MIS algorithm, even for simple graphs, e.g., unoriented trees, has been the simple randomized algorithm discovered in the 80s. This algorithm (commonly called Luby's algorithm) computes an MIS in O(log n) rounds (with high probability). This situation changed when Lenzen and Wattenhofer (PODC 2011) presented a randomized O(√log n} ⋅ log\log n)-round MIS algorithm for unoriented trees. This algorithm was improved by Barenboim et al. (FOCS 2012), resulting in an MIS algorithm running in O(√log n ⋅ log\log n) rounds."
Brief Announcement: A Key-Value Map for Massive Real-Time Analytics,"Modern big data processing platforms employ huge in-memory key-value (KV-) maps. Their applications simultaneously drive high-rate data ingestion and large-scale analytics. These two scenarios expect KV-map implementations that scale well with both real-time updates and massive atomic scans triggered by range queries. However, today's state-of-the art concurrent KV-maps fall short of satisfying these requirements -- they either provide only limited or non-atomic scans, or severely hamper updates when scans are ongoing. We present KiWi, the first atomic KV-map to efficiently support simultaneous massive data retrieval and real-time access. The key to achieving this is treating scans as first class citizens, whereas most existing concurrent KV-maps do not provide atomic scans, and some others add them to existing maps without rethinking the design anew."

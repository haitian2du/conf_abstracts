A Faster Distributed Radio Broadcast Primitive: Extended Abstract,We present a faster distributed broadcasting primitive for the classical radio network model.
Broadcast Extensions with Optimal Communication and Round Complexity,The problem of broadcast and Byzantine Agreement are of interest to both distributed computing and cryptography community. Often these primitives require prohibitive communication and round complexity. Broadcast extensions have been introduced to broadcast long messages at the cost of small number of broadcasts for bit. The latter are referred to as seed broadcasts.
Two-Bit Messages are Sufficient to Implement Atomic Read/Write Registers in Crash-prone Systems,"Atomic registers are certainly the most basic objects of computing science. Their implementation on top of an n-process asynchronous message-passing system has received a lot of attention. It has been shown that t < n/2 (where t is the maximal number of processes that may crash) is a necessary and sufficient requirement to build an atomic register on top of a crash-prone asynchronous message-passing system. Considering such a context, this paper presents an algorithm which implements a single-writer multi-reader atomic register with four message types only, and where no message needs to carry control information in addition to its type. Hence, two bits are sufficient to capture all the control information carried by all the implementation messages. Moreover, the messages of two types need to carry a data value while the messages of the two other types carry no value at all. As far as we know, this algorithm is the first with such a sufficiency property on the size of control information carried by messages. It is also particularly efficient from a time complexity point of view."
How Proofs are Prepared at Camelot: Extended Abstract,"We study a design framework for robust, independently verifiable, and workload-balanced distributed algorithms working on a common input. The framework builds on recent noninteractive Merlin--Arthur proofs of batch evaluation of Williams~[31st IEEE Colloquium on Computational Complexity (CCC'16, May 29-June 1, 2016, Tokyo), to appear] with the basic observation that Merlin's magic is not needed for batch evaluation: mere Knights can prepare the independently verifiable proof, in parallel, and with intrinsic error-correction."
Brief Announcement: Proactive Secret Sharing with a Dishonest Majority,"In a secret sharing scheme a dealer shares a secret s among n parties such that an adversary corrupting up to t parties does not learn s, while any t+1 parties can efficiently recover s. Over a long period of time all parties may be corrupted thus violating the threshold, which is accounted for in Proactive Secret Sharing (PSS). PSS schemes periodically rerandomize (refresh) the shares of the secret and invalidate old ones. PSS retains confidentiality even when all parties are corrupted over the lifetime of the secret, but no more than t during a certain window of time, called the refresh period. Existing PSS schemes only guarantee secrecy in the presence of an honest majority with less than n2 total corruptions during a refresh period; an adversary corrupting a single additional party, even if only passively, obtains the secret. This work is the first feasibility result demonstrating PSS tolerating a dishonest majority, it introduces the first PSS scheme secure against t<n passive adversaries without recovery of lost shares, it can also recover from honest faulty parties losing their shares, and when tolerating e faults the scheme tolerates t<n-e passive corruptions. A non-robust version of the scheme can tolerate t<n/2-e active adversaries, and mixed adversaries that control a combination of passively and actively corrupted parties that are a majority, but where less than n/2-e of such corruptions are active. We achieve these high thresholds with O(n4) communication when sharing a single secret, and O(n3) communication when sharing multiple secrets in batches."

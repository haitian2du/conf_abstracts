A Distributed (2+ε)-Approximation for Vertex Cover in O(logδ/ε log log δ) Rounds,"We present a simple deterministic distributed (2+ε) approximation algorithm for minimum weight vertex cover, which completes in O(logδ/εlog logδ) rounds, where δ is the maximum degree in the graph, for any ε > 0 which is at most O(1). For a constant ε, this implies a constant approximation in Ologδ/log log δ) rounds, which contradicts the lower bound of [KMW10]."
The Greedy Spanner is Existentially Optimal,"The greedy spanner is arguably the simplest and most well-studied spanner construction. Experimental results demonstrate that it is at least as good as any other spanner construction, in terms of both the size and weight parameters. However, a rigorous proof for this statement has remained elusive. In this work we fill in the theoretical gap via a surprisingly simple observation: The greedy spanner is existentially optimal (or existentially near-optimal) for several important graph families. Focusing on the weight parameter, the state-of-the-art spanner constructions for both general graphs (due to Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [SODA'16]) and doubling metrics (due to Gottlieb [FOCS'15]) are complex. Plugging our observation on these results, we conclude that the greedy spanner achieves near-optimal weight guarantees for both general graphs and doubling metrics, thus resolving two longstanding conjectures in the area. Further, we observe that approximate-greedy algorithms are existentially near-optimal as well. Consequently, we provide an O(n log n)-time construction of (1+epsilon)-spanners for doubling metrics with constant lightness and degree. Our construction improves Gottlieb's construction, whose runtime is O(n log2 n) and whose number of edges and degree are unbounded, and remarkably, it matches the state-of-the-art Euclidean result (due to Gudmundsson et al. [SICOMP'02]) in all the involved parameters (up to dependencies on epsilon and the dimension)."
MST in Log-Star Rounds of Congested Clique,"We present a randomized algorithm that computes a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in O(log* n) rounds, with high probability, in the Congested Clique model of distributed computing. In this model, the input is a graph on n nodes, initially each node knows only its incident edges, and per round each two nodes can exchange O(log n) bits. Our key technical novelty is an O(log* n) Graph Connectivity algorithm, the heart of which is a (recursive) forest growth method, based on a combination of two ideas: a sparsity-sensitive sketching aimed at sparse graphs and a random edge sampling aimed at dense graphs. Our result improves significantly over the O(log log log n) algorithm of Hegeman et al. [PODC 2015] and the O(log log n) algorithm of Lotker et al. [SPAA 2003; SICOMP 2005]."
Distributed Algorithms for Planar Networks I: Planar Embedding,"This paper presents the first (non-trivial) distributed planar embedding algorithm. We consider this a crucial first step in a broader program to design efficient distributed algorithms for planar networks. We work in the standard distributed model in which nodes can send an O(log n)-bit message to each of their neighbors per round. In a planar network, with n nodes and diameter D, our deterministic planar embedding algorithm uses O(D dot min{log n, D) rounds to compute a combinatorial planar embedding, which consists of each node knowing the clockwise order of its incident edges in a fixed planar drawing. The complexity of our algorithm is near-optimal and matches the trivial lower bound of Omega(D) up to a log n factor. No algorithm outperforming the trivial round complexity of O(n) was known prior to this work."
Brief Announcement: Labeling Schemes for Power-Law Graphs,"A labeling scheme is a method of distributing the information about the structure of a graph among its vertices by assigning short labels, such that a selected function on pairs of vertices can be computed using only their labels. A labeling scheme consists of an encoder that has access to the entire graph and assigns labels to vertices, and a decoder that has access to only the labels of a smaller set of vertices (typically a pair) and returns information about this subset (e.g., whether two vertices are adjacent, or the distance between them in the graph). The main objective is to minimize the maximum label size: the maximum number of bits used in a label of any vertex. Among the applications of labeling schemes are XML search engines, mapping services, and internet routing."
Brief Announcement: Sublinear-Space Distance Labeling Using Hubs,"A distance labeling scheme is an assignment of bit-labels to the vertices of an undirected, unweighted graph such that the distance between any pair of vertices can be decoded solely from their labels. We propose a series of new labeling schemes within the framework of so-called hub labeling (HL, also known as landmark labeling or 2-hop-cover labeling), in which each node u stores its distance to all nodes from an appropriately chosen set of hubs S(u) ⊆ V. For a queried pair of nodes (u,v), the length of a shortest u--v-path passing through a hub node from S(u)∩S(v) is then used as an upper bound on the distance between u and v."
Brief Announcement: Optimal Leader Election in Multi-Hop Radio Networks,"We present optimal randomized leader election algorithms for multi-hop radio networks, which run in expected time asymptotically equal to that required to broadcast one message to the network. We first observe that, under certain assumptions, a simulation approach of Bar-Yehuda, Golreich and Itai (1991) can be used to obtain an algorithm that for directed and undirected networks elects a leader in O(D log n/D + log2n) expected time, where n is the number of the nodes and $D$ is the eccentricity of the network. We then extend this approach to present an algorithm which operates on undirected radio networks with collision detection (and in fact the weaker beep model) and elects a leader in O(D + log n) expected time."
Brief Announcement: The Small World of Curious Beings,"We present a strategic model of network creation that satisfies all known theoretically verifiable properties of the small-world phenomenon. We consider a population that is uniformly distributed in a low-dimensional space, and show that in such a society if each individual follows the status of a subset of others by investing attention in order to satisfy curiosity, then small-world properties appear naturally as a side effect."

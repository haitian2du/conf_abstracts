Contention Resolution on a Fading Channel,"In this paper, we study upper and lower bounds for contention resolution on a single hop fading channel; i.e., a channel where receive behavior is determined by a signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) equation. The best known previous solution solves the problem in this setting in O(log2n log log n) rounds, with high probability in the system size n. We describe and analyze an algorithm that solves the problem in O(log n + log R) rounds, where R is the ratio between the longest and shortest link, and is a value upper bounded by a polynomial in n for most feasible deployments. We complement this result with an Ω(log n) lower bound that proves the bound tight for reasonable R. We note that in the classical radio network model (which does not include signal fading), high probability contention resolution requires Ω(log 2n) rounds. Our algorithm, therefore, affirms the conjecture that the spectrum reuse enabled by fading should allow distributed algorithms to achieve a significant improvement on this log2n speed limit. In addition, we argue that the new techniques required to prove our upper and lower bounds are of general use for analyzing other distributed algorithms in this increasingly well-studied fading channel setting."
Reliable Communication over Highly Connected Noisy Networks,"We consider the task of multiparty computation performed over networks in the presence of random noise. Given an n-party protocol that takes $R$ rounds assuming noiseless communication, the goal is to find a coding scheme that takes R' rounds and computes the same function with high probability even when the communication is noisy, while maintaining a constant asymptotic rate, i.e., while keeping n,R→∞R/R' positive."
Contention Resolution on Multiple Channels with Collision Detection,"In this paper, we consider the classical contention resolution problem in which an unknown subset of n possible nodes are activated and connected to a shared channel. The problem is solved in the first round that an active node transmits alone (thus breaking symmetry). Contention resolution has been an active research topic for over four decades. Accordingly, tight upper and lower bounds are known for most major model assumptions. There remains, however, an important case that is unresolved: contention resolution with multiple channels and collision detection. (Tight bounds are known for contention resolution with multiple channels, and contention resolution with collision detection, but not for the combination of both assumptions.)"
How Asynchrony Affects Rumor Spreading Time,"In standard randomized (push-pull) rumor spreading, nodes communicate in synchronized rounds. In each round every node contacts a random neighbor in order to exchange the rumor (i.e., either push the rumor to its neighbor or pull it from the neighbor). A natural asynchronous variant of this algorithm is one where each node has an independent Poisson clock with rate 1, and every node contacts a random neighbor whenever its clock ticks. This asynchronous variant is arguably a more realistic model in various settings, including message broadcasting in communication networks, and information dissemination in social networks. In this paper we study how asynchrony affects the rumor spreading time, that is, the time before a rumor originated at a single node spreads to all nodes in the graph. Our first result states that the asynchronous push-pull rumor spreading time is asymptotically bounded by the standard synchronous time. Precisely, we show that for any graph G on n-nodes, where the synchronous push-pull protocol informs all nodes within T(G) rounds with high probability, the asynchronous protocol needs at most time O(T(G)+log n) to inform all nodes with high probability. On the other hand, we show that the expected synchronous push-pull rumor spreading time is bounded by O(√ n) times the expected asynchronous time. These results improve upon the bounds for both directions shown recently by Acan et al. (PODC 2015). An interesting implication of our first result is that in regular graphs, the weaker push-only variant of synchronous rumor spreading has the same asymptotic performance as the synchronous push-pull algorithm."
Brief Announcement: An Exponential Separation Between Randomized and Deterministic Complexity in the LOCAL Model,"Over the past 30 years numerous algorithms have been designed for symmetry breaking problems in the LOCAL model, such as maximal matching, MIS, vertex coloring, and edge-coloring. For most problems the best randomized algorithm is at least exponentially faster than the best deterministic algorithm. In this paper we prove that these exponential gaps are necessary and establish numerous connections between the deterministic and randomized complexities in the LOCAL model. Each of our results has a very compelling take-away message: Fast Δ-coloring of trees requires random bits. Building on the recent randomized lower bounds of Brandt et al. [6], we prove that the randomized complexity of Δ-coloring a tree with maximum degree Δ is θ(logΔ log n), for any Δ ≥ 55, whereas its deterministic complexity is θ(logΔn) for any Δ ≥ 3. This also establishes a large separation between the deterministic complexity of Δ-coloring and (Δ+1)-coloring trees.Randomized lower bounds imply deterministic lower bounds. We prove that any deterministic algorithm for a natural class of problems that runs in O(1) + o(logΔn) rounds can be transformed to run in O(log* n -- log*Δ + 1) rounds. If the transformed algorithm violates a lower bound (even allowing randomization), then one can conclude that the problem requires Ω(logΔn) time deterministically. (This gives an alternate proof that deterministically Δ-coloring a tree with small Δ takes Ω(logΔn) rounds.)Deterministic lower bounds imply randomized lower bounds. We prove that the randomized complexity of any natural problem on instances of size n is at least its deterministic complexity on instances of size √log n}. This shows that a deterministic Ω(logΔn) lower bound for any problem (Δ-coloring a tree, for example) implies a randomized Ω(logΔ log n) lower bound. It also illustrates that the graph shattering technique employed in recent randomized symmetry breaking algorithms is absolutely essential to the LOCAL model. For example, it is provably impossible to improve the 2O(√log log n) terms in the complexities of the best MIS and (Δ+1)-coloring algorithms without also improving the 2O(√log n})-round Panconesi-Srinivasan algorithms."

Brief Announcement: Reliable Message Transmission under Partial Knowledge and General Adversaries,"We address the problem of Reliable Message Transmission (RMT), in the general adversary model of Hirt and Maurer[2], which subsumes earlier models such as the global or local threshold adversaries. We employ the recently introduced Partial Knowledge Model[8], which captures any case of initial players' topology knowledge. Our main contribution is the determination of a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving RMT in the partial knowledge model with a general adversary. We propose the RMT-Partial Knowledge Algorithm (RMT-PKA), which solves RMT whenever this is possible, therefore it is a unique algorithm, as defined in[10]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unique protocol for RMT against general adversaries in the partial knowledge model."
Brief Announcement: Self-stabilizing Clock Synchronization with 3-bit Messages,"This paper is motivated by the aspiration to identify the weakest computational models that allow for efficient, robust distributed computation. We focus on one of the most fundamental building-blocks in distributed computing, namely, Broadcast. In this problem, a unique source agent $s$ needs to disseminate a bit $b$ to the rest of the population. To account for unpredictability issues that may result from uncoordinated executions, we consider a self-stabilizing setting, in which a correct configuration must be reached eventually, despite processors starting the execution with arbitrary initial states (that do not violate the requirement for the existence of a unique source). Similarly to many works on broadcast, we consider a synchronous communication model on a complete anonymous network, in which in each round, each agent can extract information from two other agents, chosen uniformly at random. Our focus is on identifying the smallest message size that is required in order to achieve fast self-stabilizing broadcast. We first observe that with an extra bit added to the message-size and a small additive penalty to the running time, the self-stabilizing broadcast problem can be reduced to a self-stabilizing clock-synchronization problem, where agents aim to synchronize their clocks modulo some integer T. Our main technical contribution lies in solving the latter problem in poly-logarithmic time using only 3 bits per interaction. This allows for a self-stabilizing broadcast protocol that uses only 4 bits per interaction and converges in O log n time."

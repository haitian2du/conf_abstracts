Search on a Line with Faulty Robots,"We consider the problem of searching on a line using n mobile robots, of which at most f are faulty, and the remaining are reliable. The robots start at the same location and move in parallel along the line with the same speed. There is a target placed on the line at a location unknown to the robots. Reliable robots can find the target when they reach its location, but faulty robots cannot detect the target. Our goal is to design a parallel algorithm minimizing the competitive ratio, represented by the worst case ratio between the time of arrival of the first reliable robot at the target, and the distance from the source to the target."
Uniform Deployment of Mobile Agents in Asynchronous Rings,"In this paper, we consider the uniform deployment problem of mobile agents in asynchronous unidirectional rings, which requires the agents to uniformly spread in the ring. The uniform deployment problem is striking contrast to the rendezvous problem which requires the agents to meet at the same node. While the rendezvous aims to break the symmetry, the uniform deployment aims to attain the symmetry. Hence, we are interested in clarifying how easily the uniform deployment problem can be solved compared to the rendezvous problem. We consider two problem settings. First, we consider agents with knowledge of k, where k is the number of agents. In this case, our proposed algorithm solves the uniform deployment problem with termination detection. This algorithm requires O(log n) memory per agent, O(n log k) time, and O(kn) total moves, where n is the number of nodes. Next, we consider agents with no knowledge of k or n. In this case, we show that, when termination detection is required, there exists no algorithm to solve the uniform deployment problem. For this reason, we consider the relaxed uniform deployment problem that does not require termination detection, and we propose an algorithm to solve the relaxed uniform deployment problem. This algorithm requires O(k/l log (n/l)) memory per agent, O(n/l) time, and O(kn/l) total moves, where l is the symmetry degree of the initial configuration (l â‰¥ 1). Note that both the algorithms achieve the uniform deployment from any initial configuration, which is a striking difference from the rendezvous problem because the rendezvous problem is not solvable from some initial configurations."
Fault-Tolerant Multi-Agent Optimization: Optimal Iterative Distributed Algorithms,"This paper addresses the problem of distributed multi-agent optimization in which each agent i has a local cost function hi(x), and the goal is to optimize a global cost function that aggregates the local cost functions. Such optimization problems are of interest in many contexts, including distributed machine learning, distributed resource allocation, and distributed robotics."
Brief Announcement: Active Information Spread in Networks,"Identifying the most influential spreaders is an important issue for the study of the dynamics of information diffusion in complex networks. In this paper we analyze the following spreading model. Initially, a few nodes know a piece of information and are active spreaders of it. At subsequent rounds, spreaders communicate the information to their neighbors. Upon receiving the information, a node becomes aware of it but does not necessarily become a spreader; it starts spreading only if it gets the information from a sufficiently large number of its neighbors. We study the problem of choosing a small set of initial spreaders so as to maximize the final number of nodes that become aware of the information."

Brief Announcement: Probabilistic Asynchronous Arbitrary Pattern Formation,"We propose a new probabilistic pattern formation algorithm for oblivious mobile robots that operates in the ASYNC model. Unlike previous work, our algorithm makes no assumptions about the local coordinate systems of robots (the robots do not share a common ""North"" nor a common ""Right""), yet it preserves the ability from any initial configuration that contains at least 5 robots to form any general pattern (and not just patterns that satisfy symmetricity predicates). Our proposal also gets rid of the previous assumption (in the same model) that robots do not pause while moving (so, our robots really are fully asynchronous), and the amount of randomness is kept low -- a single random bit per robot per Look-Compute-Move cycle is used. Our protocol consists in the combination of two phases, a probabilistic leader election phase, and a deterministic pattern formation one. As the deterministic phase does not use chirality, it may be of independent interest in the deterministic context. A noteworthy feature of our algorithm is the ability to form patterns with multiplicity points (except the gathering case due to impossibility results), a new feature in the context of pattern formation that we believe is an important asset of our approach."
Brief Announcement: Pattern Formation Problem for Synchronous Mobile Robots in the Three Dimensional Euclidean Space,We investigate the pattern formation problem that requires a swarm of autonomous mobile robots to form a given target pattern in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. We show a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronous robots to form a given target pattern from an initial configuration. We give a pattern formation algorithm for solvable instances that does not need any local memory at each robot.

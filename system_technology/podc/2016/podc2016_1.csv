"New Opportunities for PODC?: Massive, Volatile, but Highly Predictable Resources","Classical models for distributed systems focus on fine-grained resources and failures (e.g. single processes and fail-stop or byzantine). Cheap hardware, the rise of the worldwide web, and now the rise of cloud computing has transformed distributed systems practice. Instead of single resources, application sites have ten-thousands of virtual machines, and in addition to independent failures, there are a raft of correlated failure modes."

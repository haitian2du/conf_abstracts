Distributed Strong Diameter Network Decomposition: Extended Abstract,"For a pair of positive parameters D,Χ, a partition P of the vertex set V of an n-vertex graph G = (V,E) into disjoint clusters of diameter at most D each is called a (D,Χ) network decomposition}, if the supergraph G(P), obtained by contracting each of the clusters of P, can be properly Χ-colored. The decomposition P is said to be strong (resp., weak) if each of the clusters has strong (resp., weak) diameter at most D, i.e., if for every cluster C ∈ P and every two vertices u,v ∈ C, the distance between them in the induced graph G(C) of C (resp., in G) is at most D."
Optimal Dynamic Distributed MIS,"Finding a maximal independent set (MIS) in a graph is a cornerstone task in distributed computing. The local nature of an MIS allows for fast solutions in a static distributed setting, which are logarithmic in the number of nodes or in their degrees. The result trivially applies for the dynamic distributed model, in which edges or nodes may be inserted or deleted. In this paper, we take a different approach which exploits locality to the extreme, and show how to update an MIS in a dynamic distributed setting, either synchronous or asynchronous, with only a single adjustment and in a single round, in expectation. These strong guarantees hold for the complete fully dynamic setting: Insertions and deletions, of edges as well as nodes, gracefully and abruptly. This strongly separates the static and dynamic distributed models, as super-constant lower bounds exist for computing an MIS in the former."
A Local Constant Factor MDS Approximation for Bounded Genus Graphs,"The Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem is not only one of the most fundamental problems in distributed computing, it is also one of the most challenging ones. While it is well-known that minimum dominating sets cannot be approximated locally on general graphs, over the last years, several breakthroughs have been made on computing local approximations on sparse graphs."
On Efficient Distributed Construction of Near Optimal Routing Schemes: Extended Abstract,"Given a distributed network represented by a weighted undirected graph G=(V,E) on n vertices, and a parameter k, we devise a distributed algorithm that computes a routing scheme in O(n1/2+1/k+D)⋅ no(1) rounds, where D is the hop-diameter of the network. The running time nearly matches the lower bound of Ω(n1/2+D) rounds (which holds for any scheme with polynomial stretch). The routing tables are of size Õ(n1/k), the labels are of size O(k log2n), and every packet is routed on a path suffering stretch at most 4k-5+o(1). Our construction nearly matches the state-of-the-art for routing schemes built in a centralized sequential manner. The previous best algorithms for building routing tables in a distributed small messages model were by [LP13a, STOC 2013] and [LP15, PODC 2015]. The former has similar properties but suffers from substantially larger routing tables of size O(n1/2+1/k), while the latter has sub-optimal running time of Õ(min{(nD)1/2 ⋅ n1/k,n2/3+2/(3k)+D})."
Brief Announcement: Deterministic Graph Connectivity in the Broadcast Congested Clique,"We present deterministic constant-round protocols for the graph connectivity problem in the model where each of the n nodes of a graph receives a row of the adjacency matrix, and broadcasts a single sublinear size message to all other nodes. Communication rounds are synchronous. This model is sometimes called the broadcast congested clique. Specifically, we exhibit a deterministic protocol that computes the connected components of the input graph in [1/ε] rounds, each player communicating O(nε ⋅ log n) bits per round, with 0 < ε ≤ 1."

Deterministic Objects: Life Beyond Consensus,"For all integers m ≥ 2, we construct an infinite sequence of deterministic objects of consensus number m with strictly increasing computational power. In particular, this refutes the Common2 Conjecture, which claimed that every deterministic object of consensus number 2 has a deterministic, wait-free implementation from 2-consensus objects and registers in a system with any finite number of processes."
Unbeatable Set Consensus via Topological and Combinatorial Reasoning,"The set consensus problem has played an important role in the study of distributed systems for over two decades. Indeed, the search for lower bounds and impossibility results for this problem spawned the topological approach to distributed computing, which has given rise to new techniques in the design and analysis of protocols. The design of efficient solutions to set consensus has also proven to be challenging. In the synchronous crash failure model, the literature contains a sequence of solutions to set consensus, each improving upon the previous ones. This paper presents an unbeatable protocol for nonuniform k-set consensus in the synchronous crash failure model. This is an efficient protocol whose decision times cannot be improved upon. Moreover, the description of our protocol is extremely succinct. Proving unbeatability of this protocol is a nontrivial challenge. We provide two proofs for its unbeatability: one is a subtle constructive combinatorial proof, and the other is a topological proof of a new style. These two proofs provide new insight into the connection between topological reasoning and combinatorial reasoning about protocols, which has long been a subject of interest. In particular, our topological proof reasons in a novel way about subcomplexes of the protocol complex, and sheds light on an open question posed by Guerraoui and Pochon (2009). Finally, using the machinery developed in the design of this unbeatable protocol, we propose a protocol for uniform k-set consensus that beats all known solutions by a large margin."
A Polylogarithmic Gossip Algorithm for Plurality Consensus,"Consider n anonymous nodes each initially supporting an opinion in {1, 2, …, k} and suppose that they should all learn the opinion with the largest support. Per round, each node contacts a random other node and exchanges B bits with it, where typically B is at most O(log n)."
Noisy Rumor Spreading and Plurality Consensus,"Error-correcting codes are efficient methods for handling noisy communication channels in the context of technological networks. However, such elaborate methods differ a lot from the unsophisticated way biological entities are supposed to communicate. Yet, it has been recently shown by Feinerman, Haeupler, and Korman [PODC 2014] that complex coordination tasks such as rumor spreading and majority consensus can ε plausibly be achieved in biological systems subject to noisy communication channels, where every message transferred through a channel remains intact with small probability 1 over 2 + ε, without using coding techniques. This result is a considerable step towards a better understanding of the way biological entities may cooperate. It has nevertheless been established only in the case of 2-valued opinions: rumor spreading aims at broadcasting a single-bit opinion to all nodes, and majority consensus aims at leading all nodes to adopt the single-bit opinion that was initially present in the system with (relative) majority. In this paper, we extend this previous work to k-valued opinions, for any constant k≥2."
Rational Consensus: Extended Abstract,"We provide a game-theoretic analysis of consensus, assuming that processes are controlled by rational agents and may fail by crashing. We consider agents that care only about consensus: that is, (a) an agent's utility depends only on the consensus value achieved (and not, for example, on the number of messages the agent sends) and (b) agents strictly prefer reaching consensus to not reaching consensus. We show that, under these assumptions, there is no ex post Nash Equilibrium, even with only one failure. Roughly speaking, this means that there must always exist a failure pattern (a description of who fails, when they fail, and which agents they do not send messages to in the round that they fail) and initial preferences for which an agent can gain by deviating. On the other hand, if we assume that there is a distribution π on the failure patterns and initial preferences, then under minimal assumptions on π, there is a Nash equilibrium that tolerates f failures (i.e., π puts probability 1 on there being at most f failures) if f+1 < n (where n is the total number of agents). Moreover, we show that a slight extension of the Nash equilibrium strategy is also a sequential equilibrium (under the same assumptions about the distribution π)."
Brief Announcement: A Tight Space Bound for Consensus,"Existing n-process randomized wait-free and obstruction-free consensus protocols from registers all use at least n registers. In 1992, it was proved that such protocols must use Ω(√n) registers. Recently, this was improved to Ω(n) registers in the anonymous setting, where processes do not have identifiers. We have recently proved that at least n-1 registers are needed, even if processes have identifiers."

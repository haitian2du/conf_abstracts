Concurrent Data Structures,"Data structures are an important component of efficient and well-structured programs. In shared memory distributed computing, correct data structures are difficult to construct because concurrent accesses by different processes can conflict with one another. One simple approach is to use a global lock to restrict access to one process at a time. But this can severely affect performance. This talk will present a survey of some of the interesting techniques that have been developed to build efficient concurrent data structures. It will also discuss how we think concurrent data structures should be evaluated."

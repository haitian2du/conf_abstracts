Exploiting Spontaneous Transmissions for Broadcasting and Leader Election in Radio Networks,"We study two fundamental communication primitives: broadcasting and leader election in the classical model of multi-hop radio networks with unknown topology and without collision detection mechanisms. It has been known for almost 20 years that in undirected networks with n nodes and diameter D, randomized broadcasting requires Ω(D log t n/D + log2n) rounds in expectation, assuming that uninformed nodes are not allowed to communicate (until they are informed). Only very recently, Haeupler and Wajc (PODC'2016) showed that this bound can be slightly improved for the model with spontaneous transmissions, providing an O(D(log n log log n)/(log D) + logO(1)n)-time broadcasting algorithm. In this paper, we give a new and faster algorithm that completes broadcasting in O(D(log n)/(log D) + logO(1)n) time, with high probability. This yields the first optimal O(D)-time broadcasting algorithm whenever D is polynomial in n."
The Space Requirement of Local Forwarding on Acyclic Networks,"We consider packet forwarding in acyclic networks with bounded adversarial packet injections. We focus on the model of adversarial queuing theory, where each packet is injected into the network with a prescribed path to its destination, and both the long-range average rate and the short-range burst size are bounded. Each edge has an associated buffer that stores packets while they wait to cross the edge. Our goal is to minimize the buffer space required to avoid overflows."
Communication Primitives in Cognitive Radio Networks,"Cognitive radio networks are a new type of multi-channel wireless network in which different nodes can have access to different sets of channels. By providing multiple channels, they improve the efficiency and reliability of wireless communication. However, the heterogeneous nature of cognitive radio networks also brings new challenges to the design and analysis of distributed algorithms. In this paper, we focus on two fundamental problems in cognitive radio networks: neighbor discovery, and global broadcast. We consider a network containing n nodes, each of which has access to c channels. We assume the network has diameter D, and each pair of neighbors have at least k≥1, and at most kmax≤c, shared channels. We also assume each node has at most Δ neighbors. For the neighbor discovery problem, we design a randomized algorithm CSeek which has time complexity Õ( (c2/k) + (kmax/k)*Δ ). CSeek is flexible and robust, which allows us to use it as a generic ""filter"" to find ""well-connected"" neighbors with an even shorter running time. We then move on to the global broadcast problem, and propose CGCast, a randomized algorithm which takes Õ( (c2/k) + (kmax/k)*Δ + D*Δ) time. CGCast uses CSeek to achieve communication among neighbors, and uses edge coloring to establish an efficient schedule for fast message dissemination."
Broadcasting in Noisy Radio Networks,"The widely-studied radio network model [Chlamtac and Kutten, 1985] is a graph-based description that captures the inherent impact of collisions in wireless communication. In this model, the strong assumption is made that node v receives a message from a neighbor if and only if exactly one of its neighbors broadcasts. We relax this assumption by introducing a new noisy radio network model in which random faults occur at senders or receivers. Specifically, for a constant noise parameter p ∈ [0,1), either every sender has probability p of transmitting noise or every receiver of a single transmission in its neighborhood has probability p of receiving noise."
Gossip in a Smartphone Peer-to-Peer Network,"In this paper, we study the fundamental problem of gossip in the mobile telephone model: a recently introduced variation of the classical telephone model modified to better describe the local peer-to-peer communication services implemented in many popular smartphone operating systems. In more detail, the mobile telephone model differs from the classical telephone model in three ways: (1) each device can participate in at most one connection per round; (2) the network topology can undergo a parameterized rate of change; and (3) devices can advertise a parameterized number of bits about their state to their neighbors in each round before connection attempts are initiated. We begin by describing and analyzing new randomized gossip algorithms in this model under the harsh assumption of a network topology that can change completely in every round. We prove a significant time complexity gap between the case where nodes can advertise 0 bits to their neighbors in each round, and the case where nodes can advertise 1 bit. For the latter assumption, we present two solutions: the first depends on a shared randomness source, while the second eliminates this assumption using a pseudorandomness generator we prove to exist with a novel generalization of a classical result from the study of two-party communication complexity. We then turn our attention to the easier case where the topology graph is stable, and describe and analyze a new gossip algorithm that provides a substantial performance improvement for many parameters. We conclude by studying a relaxed version of gossip in which it is only necessary for nodes to each learn a specified fraction of the messages in the system. We prove that our existing algorithms for dynamic network topologies and a single advertising bit solve this relaxed version up to a polynomial factor faster (in network size) for many parameters. These are the first known gossip results for the mobile telephone model, and they significantly expand our understanding of how to communicate and coordinate in this increasingly relevant setting."

Verifiable Outsourced Computation: A Survey,"I will review recent (and not so recent) research on the topic of Verifiable Outsourced Computation. The problem of verifying the correctness of computations done by untrusted parties was a driving motivation behind some of the most celebrated results in Complexity Theory in the 90's, from Interactive Proofs to the PCP Theorem. More recently this problem has received renewed attention from more applied corners of Computer Science, due to the rise of the Cloud Computing paradigm, where data and computation is outsourced to external ""providers"" who may not be necessarily trusted. Current research is focused on making some of those old theoretical results applicable in practice, a task that ultimately will require both theoretical and more applied systems breakthroughs."

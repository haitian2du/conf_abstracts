Some Sequential Algorithms are Almost Always Parallel,"Over the years many interesting and efficient parallel algorithms have been developed to solve a wide variety of problems, but not much attention has been paid to studying the inherent parallelism in sequential algorithms---i.e., understanding the depth of their dependence structure, and how shallow dependence structures might beused to develop efficient parallel implementations."

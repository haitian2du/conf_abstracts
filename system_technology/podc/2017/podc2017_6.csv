"A Simple Deterministic Distributed MST Algorithm, with Near-Optimal Time and Message Complexities","Distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) problem is one of the most central and fundamental problems in distributed graph algorithms. Kutten and Peleg [KP98] devised an algorithm with running time O(D + √n . log* n), where D is the hop-diameter of the input n-vertex m-edge graph, and with message complexity O(m + n3/2). Peleg and Rubinovich [PR99] showed that the running time of the algorithm of [KP98] is essentially tight, and asked if one can achieve near-optimal running time together with near-optimal message complexity."
Distributed Approximation of Maximum Independent Set and Maximum Matching,"We present a simple distributed Δ-approximation algorithm for maximum weight independent set (MaxIS) in the CONGEST model which completes in O(MIS ⋅ log W) rounds, where Δ is the maximum degree, MIS is the number of rounds needed to compute a maximal independent set (MIS) on G, and W is the maximum weight of a node. Plugging in the best known algorithm for MIS gives a randomized solution in O(log n log W) rounds, where n is the number of nodes. We also present a deterministic O(Δ +log* n)-round algorithm based on coloring."
"Deterministic Distributed (Delta + o(Delta))-Edge-Coloring, and Vertex-Coloring of Graphs with Bounded Diversity","In the distributed message-passing setting a communication network is represented by a graph whose vertices represent processors that perform local computations and communicate over the edges of the graph. In the distributed edge-coloring problem the processors are required to assign colors to edges, such that all edges incident on the same vertex are assigned distinct colors. The previously-known deterministic algorithms for edge-coloring employed at least (2Δ - 1) colors, even though any graph admits an edge-coloring with Δ + 1 colors [36]. Moreover, the previously-known deterministic algorithms that employed at most O(Δ) colors required superlogarithmic time [3,6,7,17]. In the current paper we devise deterministic edge-coloring algorithms that employ only Δ + o(Δ) colors, for a very wide family of graphs. Specifically, as long as the arboricity a of the graph is a = O(Δ1 - ε), for a constant ε > 0, our algorithm computes such a coloring within polylogarithmic deterministic time. We also devise significantly improved deterministic edge-coloring algorithms for general graphs for a very wide range of parameters. Specifically, for any value κ in the range [4Δ, 2o(log Δ) ⋅ Δ], our κ-edge-coloring algorithm has smaller running time than the best previously-known κ-edge-coloring algorithms. Our algorithms are actually much more general, since edge-coloring is equivalent to vertex-coloring of line graphs. Our method is applicable to vertex-coloring of the family of graphs with bounded diversity that contains line graphs, line graphs of hypergraphs, and many other graphs. We significantly improve upon previous vertex-coloring of such graphs, and as an implication also obtain the improved edge-coloring algorithms for general graphs."
Optimal Distance Labeling Schemes for Trees,"Labeling schemes seek to assign a short label to each node in a network, so that a function on two nodes (such as distance or adjacency) can be computed by examining their labels alone. For the particular case of trees, following a long line of research, optimal bounds (up to low order terms) were recently obtained for adjacency labeling [FOCS '15], nearest common ancestor labeling [SODA '14], and ancestry labeling [SICOMP '06]. In this paper we obtain optimal bounds for distance labeling. We present labels of size 1/4\log^2n+o(\log^2n), matching (up to low order terms) the recent 1/4\log^2n-\Oh(\log n) lower bound [ICALP '16]."
Brief Announcement: How Large is your Graph?,"We consider the problem of estimating the graph size, where one is given only local access to the graph. We formally define a query model in which one starts with a seed node and is allowed to make queries about neighbours of nodes that have already been seen. In the case of undirected graphs, an estimator of Katzir et al. (2014) based on a sample from the stationary distribution π uses O(1/(||π||2) + davg) queries; we prove that this is tight. In addition, we establish this as a lower bound even when the algorithm is allowed to crawl the graph arbitrarily; the results of Katzir et al. give an upper bound that is worse by a multiplicative factor tmix · log (n)."
Brief Announcement: Distributed Approximation for Tree Augmentation,"A minimum spanning tree (MST) is an essential structure for distributed algorithms, since it is a low-cost connected subgraph which provides an efficient way to communicate in a network. However, trees cannot survive even one link failure. In this paper, we study the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP), for which the input is a graph G and a spanning tree T of G and the goal is to augment T with a minimum (or minimum weight) set of edges Aug from G, such that T ∪ Aug remains connected after a failure of any single link."
Brief Announcement: Leader Election in SINR Model with Arbitrary Power Control,"In this article, we study the leader election problem in the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) model where nodes can adjust their transmission power. We show that in this setting it is possible to solve the leader election problem in two communication rounds, with high probability. Previously, it was known that Omega(log n) rounds were sufficient and necessary when using uniform power, where n is the number of nodes in the network."
Brief Announcement: Symmetry Breaking in the CONGEST Model: Time- and Message-Efficient Algorithms for Ruling Sets,"We study local symmetry breaking problems in the Congest model, focusing on ruling set problems, which generalize the fundamental Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem. Our work is motivated by the following central question: can we break the long-standing Θ(log n) time-complexity barrier and the Θ(m) message-complexity barrier in the Congest model for MIS or closely-related symmetry breaking problems?"

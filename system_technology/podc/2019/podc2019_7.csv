Topological Characterization of Consensus under General Message Adversaries,"In this paper, we provide a rigorous characterization of consensus solvability in synchronous directed dynamic networks controlled by an arbitrary message adversary using point-set topology: We extend the approach introduced by Alpern and Schneider in 1985 by introducing two novel topologies on the space of infinite executions: the process-view topology, induced by a distance function that relies on the local view of a given process in an execution, and the minimum topology, which is induced by a distance function that focuses on the local view of the process that is the last to distinguish two executions. We establish some simple but powerful topological results, which not only lead to a topological explanation of bivalence arguments, but also provide necessary and sufficient topological conditions on the admissible graph sequences of a message adversary for solving consensus. In particular, we characterize consensus solvability in terms of connectivity of the set of admissible graph sequences. For non-compact message adversaries, which are not limit-closed in the sense that there is a convergent sequence of graph sequences whose limit is not permitted, this requires the exclusion of all ""fair'' and ""unfair'' limit sequences that coincide with the forever bivalent runs constructed in bivalence proofs. For both compact and non-compact message adversaries, we also provide tailored characterizations of consensus solvability, i.e., tight conditions for impossibility and existence of algorithms, based on the broadcastability of the connected components of the set of admissible graph sequences."
Can Distributed Uniformity Testing Be Local?,"In the distributed uniformity testing problem, k servers draw samples from some unknown distribution, and the goal is to determine whether the unknown distribution is uniform or whether it is ε-far from uniform, where ε is a proximity parameter. Each server decides whether to accept or reject, and these decisions are sent to a referee, who makes a final decision based on the servers' local decisions. Uniformity testing is a particularly useful building-block, because it is complete for the problem of testing identity to any fixed distribution."
Hardness of Distributed Optimization,"This paper studies lower bounds for fundamental optimization problems in the CONGEST model. We show that solving problems exactly in this model can be a hard task, by providing tildeΩmega (n2) lower bounds for cornerstone problems, such as minimum dominating set (MDS), Hamiltonian path, Steiner tree and max-cut. These are almost tight, since all of these problems can be solved optimally in O(n2) rounds. Moreover, we show that even in bounded-degree graphs and even in simple graphs with maximum degree 5 and logarithmic diameter, it holds that various tasks, such as finding a maximum independent set (MaxIS) or a minimum vertex cover, are still difficult, requiring a near-tight number of tildeΩ (n) rounds."
Broadcast Congested Clique: Planted Cliques and Pseudorandom Generators,"We develop techniques to prove lower bounds for the BCAST(log n) Broadcast Congested Clique model (a distributed message passing model where in each round, each processor can broadcast an O(log n)-sized message to all other processors). Our techniques are built to prove bounds for natural input distributions. So far, all lower bounds for problems in the model relied on constructing specifically tailored graph families for the specific problem at hand, resulting in lower bounds for artificially constructed inputs, instead of natural input distributions."
Connectivity Lower Bounds in Broadcast Congested Clique,"We prove three new lower bounds for graph connectivity in the 1-bit broadcast congested clique model, BCC(1). First, in the KT-0 version of BCC(1), in which nodes are aware of neighbors only through port numbers, we show an Ømega(log n) round lower bound for CONNECTIVITY even for constant-error randomized Monte Carlo algorithms. The deterministic version of this result can be obtained via the well-known ""edge-crossing"" argument, but, the randomized version of this result requires establishing new combinatorial results regarding the indistinguishability graph induced by inputs. In our second result, we show that the Ømega(log n) lower bound result extends to the KT-1 version of the BCC(1) model, in which nodes are aware of IDs of all neighbors, though our proof works only for deterministic algorithms. Since nodes know IDs of their neighbors in the KT-1 model, it is no longer possible to play ""edge-crossing"" tricks; instead we present a reduction from the 2-party communication complexity problem PARTITION in which Alice and Bob are give two set partitions on [n] and are required to determine if the join of these two set partitions equals the trivial one-part set partition. While our KT-1 CONNECTIVITY lower bound holds only for deterministic algorithms, in our third result we extend this Ømega(log n) KT-1 lower bound to constant-error Monte Carlo algorithms for the closely related CONNECTED COMPONENTS problem. We use information-theoretic techniques to obtain this result. All our results hold for the seemingly easy special case of CONNECTIVITY in which an algorithm has to distinguish an instance with one cycle from an instance with multiple cycles. Our results showcase three rather different lower bound techniques and lay the groundwork for further improvements in lower bounds for CONNECTIVITY in the BCC(1) model."
Does Preprocessing Help under Congestion?,"This paper investigates the power of preprocessing in the CONGEST model. Schmid and Suomela (ACM HotSDN 2013) introduced the SUPPORTED CONGEST model to study the application of distributed algorithms in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). In this paper, we show that a large class of lower bounds in the CONGEST model still hold in the SUPPORTED model, highlighting the robustness of these bounds. This also raises the question how much does preprocessing help in the CONGEST model"

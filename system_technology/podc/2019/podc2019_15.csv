Implementing Mediators with Asynchronous Cheap Talk,"A mediator can help non-cooperative agents obtain an equilibrium that may otherwise not be possible. We study the ability of players to obtain the same equilibrium without a mediator, using only cheap talk, that is, nonbinding pre-play communication. Previous work has considered this problem in a synchronous setting. Here we consider the effect of asynchrony on the problem, and provide upper bounds for implementing mediators. Considering asynchronous environments introduces new subtleties, including exactly what solution concept is most appropriate and determining what move is played if the cheap talk goes on forever. Different results are obtained depending on whether the move after such ""infinite play'' is under the control of the players or part of the description of the game."
Distributed Minimum Degree Spanning Trees,"The minimum degree spanning tree (MDST) problem requires the construction of a spanning tree T for graph G, such that the maximum degree of T is the smallest among all spanning trees of G. Let d be this MDST degree for a given graph. In this paper, we present a randomized distributed approximation algorithm for the MDST problem that constructs a spanning tree with maximum degree in O(d+log n ). With high probability in n, the algorithm runs in O((D + √n) log4 n) rounds, in the broadcast-CONGEST model, where D is the graph diameter and n is the graph size. We then show how to derandomize this algorithm, obtaining the same asymptotic guarantees on degree and time complexity, but now requiring the standard CONGEST model. Although efficient approximation algorithms for the MDST problem have been known in the sequential setting since the 1990's (finding an exact solution is NP-hard), our algorithms are the first efficient distributed solutions. We conclude by proving a lower bound that establishes that any randomized MDST algorithm that guarantees a maximum degree in ∼Ω (d) requires &Ø#8764;Ω (n1/3) rounds, and any deterministic solution requires ∼Ω (n1/2) rounds. These bounds proves our deterministic algorithm to be asymptotically optimal, and eliminates the possibility of significantly more efficient randomized solutions."
Improved Distributed Approximations for Minimum-Weight Two-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph,"The minimum-weight 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS) problem is a natural generalization of the well-studied minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) problem, and it has received considerable attention in the area of network design. The latter problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph with an edge connectivity of 1 between each pair of vertices while the former strengthens this edge-connectivity requirement to 2. Despite this resemblance, the 2-ECSS problem is considerably more complex than MST. While MST admits a linear-time centralized exact algorithm, 2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best known centralized approximation algorithm for it (that runs in polynomial time) gives a 2-approximation."
Near-Additive Spanners In Low Polynomial Deterministic CONGEST Time,"Given a pair of parameters α ≥ 1,β ≥ 0, a subgraph G'=(V,H) of an n-vertex unweighted undirected graph G=(V,E) is called an (α,β)-spanner if for every pair u,ν ∈ V of vertices, we have dG' (u,ν)≤ α dG (u,α)+β. If β=0 the spanner is called a multiplicative α-spanner, and if α = 1+ε, for an arbitrarily small ε>0, the spanner is said to be near-additive."
A Trivial Yet Optimal Solution to Vertex Fault Tolerant Spanners,"We give a short and easy upper bound on the worst-case size of fault tolerant spanners, which improves on all prior work and is fully optimal at least in the setting of vertex faults."

The Distributed Complexity of Locally Checkable Problems on Paths is Decidable,"Consider a computer network that consists of a path with n nodes. The nodes are labeled with inputs from a constant-sized set, and the task is to find output labels from a constant-sized set subject to some local constraints---more formally, we have an LCL (locally checkable labeling) problem. How many communication rounds are needed (in the standard LOCAL model of computing) to solve this problem?"
Hardness of Exact Distance Queries in Sparse Graphs Through Hub Labeling,"A distance labeling scheme is an assignment of bit-labels to the vertices of an undirected, unweighted graph such that the distance between any pair of vertices can be decoded solely from their labels. An important class of distance labeling schemes is that of hub labelings, where a node ν ∈ G stores its distance to the so-called hubs Sν ⊆ V, chosen so that for any u,ν ∈ V there is w ∈ Su ∩ Sv belonging to some shortest uv path. Notice that for most existing graph classes, the best distance labelling constructions existing use at some point a hub labeling scheme at least as a key building block."
On the Complexity of Distributed Splitting Problems,"One of the fundamental open problems in the area of distributed graph algorithms is whether randomization is needed for efficient symmetry breaking. While there are poly log n-time randomized algorithms for all the classic symmetry breaking problems, for many of them, the best deterministic algorithms are almost exponentially slower. The following basic local splitting problem, which is known as weak splitting, takes a central role in this context: Each node of a graph G=(V,E) has to be colored red or blue such that each node of sufficiently large degree has at least one neighbor of each color. Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus [STOC '17] showed that this seemingly simple problem is complete w.r.t. the above fundamental open question in the following sense: If there is an efficient poly log n-time determinstic distributed algorithm for weak splitting, then there is such an algorithm for all locally checkable graph problems for which an efficient randomized algorithm exists. We investigate the distributed complexity of weak splitting and some closely related problems and we in particular obtain the following results: We obtain efficient algorithms for special cases of weak splitting in nearly regular graphs. We show that if δ=Ø(log n) and Δ are the minimum and maximum degrees of G, weak splitting can be solved deterministically in time O #916;(√ over δ • poly(log n)). Further, if δ = Ø(log log n) and Δ ≤ 2ε δ, the time complexity is O(Δ over δ⋅poly(log log n)). We prove that the following two related problems are also complete in the same sense: (I) Color the nodes of a graph with C ≤ poly log n colors such that each node with a sufficiently large polylogarithmic degree has at least 2 log n different colors among its neighbors, and (II) Color the nodes with a large constant number of colors so that for each node of a sufficiently large at least logarithmic degree d(v), the number of neighbors of each color is at most (1-εd(v) for some constant ε > 0."
On the Use of Randomness in Local Distributed Graph Algorithms,"We attempt to better understand randomization in local distributed graph algorithms by exploring how randomness is used and what we can gain from it: We first ask the question of how much randomness is needed to obtain efficient randomized algorithms. We show that for all locally checkable problems with poly log n-time randomized algorithms, there are such algorithms even if either (I) there is a only a single (private) independent random bit in each poly log n-neighborhood of the graph, (II) the (private) bits of randomness of different nodes are only poly log n-wise independent, or (III) there are only poly log n bits of global shared randomness (and no private randomness).Second, we study how much we can improve the error probability of randomized algorithms. For all locally checkable problems with poly log n-time randomized algorithms, we show that there are such algorithms that succeed with probability 1-n-2 ε(log log n) 2 and more generally T-round algorithms, for T ≥ poly log n, with success probability 1-n-2 εlog 2T. We also show that poly log n-time randomized algorithms with success probability 1-2-2 log ε n for some ε > 0 can be derandomized to poly log n-time deterministic algorithms. Both of the directions mentioned above, reducing the amount of randomness and improving the success probability, can be seen as partial derandomization of existing randomized algorithms. In all the above cases, we also show that any significant improvement of our results would lead to a major breakthrough, as it would imply significantly more efficient deterministic distributed algorithms for a wide class of problems."
Message Reduction in the LOCAL Model is a Free Lunch,"A new spanner construction algorithm is presented, working under the LOCAL model assuming unique edge IDs. Given an n-node communication graph, a spanner with a constant stretch and Õ(n1 + c) edges (for any small constant c > 0) is constructed efficiently --- i.e., in a constant number of rounds and a message complexity of Õ (n1 + 2c) whp."

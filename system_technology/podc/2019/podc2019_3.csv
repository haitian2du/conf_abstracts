Improved Distributed Expander Decomposition and Nearly Optimal Triangle Enumeration,"An(ε,φ)-expander decomposition of a graph G=(V,E) is a clustering of the vertices V=V1∪…∪ Vx such that (1) each cluster Vi induces subgraph with conductance at least φ, and (2) the number of inter-cluster edges is at most ε|E|. In this paper, we give an improved distributed expander decomposition, and obtain a nearly optimal distributed triangle enumeration algorithm in the CONGEST model."
Fast Approximate Shortest Paths in the Congested Clique,"We design fast deterministic algorithms for distance computation in the CONGESTED CLIQUE model. Our key contributions include: A (2+ε)-approximation for all-pairs shortest paths problem in O(log2n / ε) rounds on unweighted undirected graphs. With a small additional additive factor, this also applies for weighted graphs. This is the first sub-polynomial constant-factor approximation for APSP in this model.A (1+ε)-approximation for multi-source shortest paths problem from O(√n) sources in O(log2 n / ε) rounds on weighted undirected graphs. This is the first sub-polynomial algorithm obtaining this approximation for a set of sources of polynomial size. Our main techniques are new distance tools that are obtained via improved algorithms for sparse matrix multiplication, which we leverage to construct efficient hopsets and shortest paths. Furthermore, our techniques extend to additional distance problems for which we improve upon the state-of-the-art, including diameter approximation, and an exact single-source shortest paths algorithm for weighted undirected graphs in Õ (n1/6) rounds."
Quantum Distributed Algorithm for the All-Pairs Shortest Path Problem in the CONGEST-CLIQUE Model,"The All-Pairs Shortest Path problem (APSP) is one of the most central problems in distributed computation. In the CONGEST-CLIQUE model, in which n nodes communicate with each other over a fully connected network by exchanging messages of O(łog n) bits in synchronous rounds, the best known general algorithm for APSP uses Õ(n1/3) rounds. Breaking this barrier is a fundamental challenge in distributed graph algorithms. In this paper we investigate for the first time quantum distributed algorithms in the CONGEST-CLIQUE model, where nodes can exchange messages of O(log n) quantum bits, and show that this barrier can be broken: we construct a Õ(n1/4)-round quantum distributed algorithm for the APSP over directed graphs with polynomial weights in the CONGEST-CLIQUE model. This speedup in the quantum setting contrasts with the case of the standard CONGEST model, for which Elkin et al. (PODC 2014) showed that quantum communication does not offer significant advantages over classical communication."
Deterministic Distributed Dominating Set Approximation in the CONGEST Model,"We develop deterministic approximation algorithms for the minimum dominating set problem in the CONGEST model with an almost optimal approximation guarantee. For ε 1/ poly log Δ we obtain two algorithms with approximation factor (1 + ε)(1 + ł n (Δ + 1)) and with runtimes 2O(√ log n log log n) and O(Δ poly log Δ + poly log Δ log* n), respectively. Further we show how dominating set approximations can be deterministically transformed into a connected dominating set in the CONGEST model while only increasing the approximation guarantee by a constant factor. This results in a deterministic O(log Δ)-approximation algorithm for the minimum connected dominating set with time complexity 2O(√ log n log log n)."
Optimal Distributed Covering Algorithms,"We present a time-optimal deterministic distributed algorithm for approximating a minimum weight vertex cover in hypergraphs of rank ƒ. This problem is equivalent to the Minimum Weight Set Cover problem in which the frequency of every element is bounded by ƒ. The approximation factor of our algorithm is (ƒ + ε). Let Δ denote the maximum degree in the hypergraph. Our algorithm runs in the CONGEST model and requires O(log Δ/log log Δ) rounds, for constants ε ∈ (0,1] and ƒ ∈ N+. This is the first distributed algorithm for this problem whose running time does not depend on the vertex weights nor the number of vertices. Thus adding another member to the exclusive family of emphprovably optimal distributed algorithms."

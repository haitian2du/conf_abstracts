Towards a Theory of Randomized Shared Memory Algorithms,"Randomization has become an invaluable tool to overcome some of the problems associated with asynchrony and faultiness. Allowing processors to use random bits helps to break symmetry, and to reduce the likelihood of undesirable schedules. As a consequence, randomized techniques can lead to simpler and more efficient algorithms, and sometimes to solutions of otherwise unsolvable computational problems. However, the design and the analysis of randomized shared memory algorithms remains challenging. This talk will give an overview of recent progress towards developing a theory of randomized shared memory algorithms."

Massively Parallel Algorithms for Finding Well-Connected Components in Sparse Graphs,"Massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithms for graph problems have witnessed a resurgence of interest in recent years. Despite major progress for numerous graph problems however, the complexity of the sparse graph connectivity problem in this model has remained elusive: While classical logarithmic-round PRAM algorithms for finding connected components in any n-vertex graph have been known for more than three decades (and imply the same bounds for MPC model), no o(log n)-round MPC algorithms are known for this task with truly sublinear in n memory per machine (which is the only interesting regime for sparse graphs with O(n) edges). It is conjectured that an o(log n)-round algorithm for connectivity on general sparse graphs with n1-Ω (1) per-machine memory may not exist, a conjecture that also forms the basis for multiple conditional hardness results on the round complexity of other problems in the MPC model."
"The Complexity of (Δ+1) Coloring in Congested Clique, Massively Parallel Computation, and Centralized Local Computation","In this paper, we present new randomized algorithms that improve the complexity of the classic (Δ+1)-coloring problem, and its generalization (Δ+1)-list-coloring, in three well-studied models of distributed, parallel, and centralized computation: Distributed Congested Clique: We present an O(1)-round randomized algorithm for (Δ + 1)-list-coloring in the congested clique model of distributed computing. This settles the asymptotic complexity of this problem. It moreover improves upon the O(log* Δ)-round randomized algorithms of Parter and Su [DISC'18] and O((log log Δ)⋅ log* Δ)-round randomized algorithm of Parter [ICALP'18]."
Massively Parallel Computation of Matching and MIS in Sparse Graphs,"The Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model serves as a common abstraction of many modern large-scale parallel computation frameworks and has recently gained a lot of importance, especially in the context of classic graph problems. In this work, we mainly consider maximal matching and maximal independent set problems in the MPC model."
Weighted Matchings via Unweighted Augmentations,We design a generic method to reduce the task of finding weighted matchings to that of finding short augmenting paths in unweighted graphs. This method enables us to provide efficient implementations for approximating weighted matchings in the massively parallel computation (MPC) model and in the streaming model.

Symmetry Breaking in the Plane: Rendezvous by Robots with Unknown Attributes,"We study a fundamental question related to the feasibility of deterministic symmetry breaking in the infinite Euclidean plane for two robots that have minimal or no knowledge of the respective capabilities and ""measuring instruments'' of themselves and each other. Assume that two anonymous mobile robots are placed at different locations at unknown distance d from each other on the infinite Euclidean plane. Each robot knows neither the location of itself nor of the other robot. The robots cannot communicate wirelessly, but have a certain nonzero visibility radius r (with range r unknown to the robots). By rendezvous we mean that they are brought at distance at most r of each other by executing symmetric (identical) mobility algorithms. The robots are moving with unknown and constant but not necessarily identical speeds, their clocks and pedometers may be asymmetric, and their chirality inconsistent."
Composable Computation in Discrete Chemical Reaction Networks,"We study the composability of discrete chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that stably compute (i.e., with probability 0 of error) integer-valued functions ƒ:Nd→ N. We consider output-oblivious CRNs in which the output species is never a reactant (input) to any reaction. The class of output-oblivious CRNs is fundamental, appearing in earlier studies of CRN computation, because it is precisely the class of CRNs that can be composed by simply renaming the output of the upstream CRN to match the input of the downstream CRN."
How to Spread a Rumor: Call Your Neighbors or Take a Walk?,"We study the problem of randomized information dissemination in networks. We compare the now standard PUSH-PULL protocol, with agent-based alternatives where information is disseminated by a collection of agents performing independent random walks. In the VISIT-EXCHANGE protocol, both nodes and agents store information, and each time an agent visits a node, the two exchange all the information they have. In the MEET-EXCHANGE protocol, only the agents store information, and exchange their information with each agent they meet."
Efficient Size Estimation and Impossibility of Termination in Uniform Dense Population Protocols,"We study uniform population protocols: networks of anonymous agents whose pairwise interactions are chosen at random, where each agent uses an identical transition algorithm that does not depend on the population size n. Many existing polylog(n) time protocols for leader election and majority computation are nonuniform: to operate correctly, they require all agents to be initialized with an approximate estimate of n (specifically, the value łfloorłog n\rfloor). Our first main result is a uniform protocol for calculating łog(n) \pm O(1) with high probability in O(łog^2 n) time and O(łog^4 n) states (O(łog łog n) bits of memory). The protocol is not terminating : it does not signal when the estimate is close to the true value of łog n. If it could be made terminating with high probability, this would allow composition with protocols requiring a size estimate initially. We do show how our main protocol can be indirectly composed with others in a simple and elegant way, based on leaderless phase clocks, demonstrating that those protocols can in fact be made uniform. However, our second main result implies that the protocol cannot be made terminating, a consequence of a much stronger result: a uniform protocol for any task requiring more than constant time cannot be terminating even with probability bounded above 0, if infinitely many initial configurations are dense : any state present initially occupies Ømega(n) agents. (In particular no leader is allowed.) Crucially, the result holds no matter the memory or time permitted."
On Counting the Population Size,"We consider the problem of counting the population size in the population model. In this model, we are given a distributed system of n identical agents which interact in pairs with the goal to solve a common task. In each time step, the two interacting agents are selected uniformly at random. In this paper, we consider so-called uniform protocols, where the actions of two agents upon an interaction may not depend on the population size n. We present two population protocols to count the size of the population: protocol Approximate, which computes with high probability either [log n] or [log n], and protocol CountExact, which computes the exact population size in optimal O(log n) interactions, using Õ (n) states. Both protocols can also be converted to stable protocols that give a correct result with probability 1 by using an additional multiplicative factor of O(log n) states."
Self-Stabilizing Leader Election,"In this paper, we study the self-stabilizing leader election (SSLE) problem in population protocols. We construct a non-deterministic population protocol that can solve SSLE on directed rings of all sizes. Our algorithm uses a constant number of states and can be converted to a deterministic population protocol on undirected rings using previous techniques [8]. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to perform SSLE on directed and undirected tori of arbitrary sizes."
Logarithmic Expected-Time Leader Election in Population Protocol Model,"In this paper, we present a leader election protocol in the population protocol model that stabilizes within O(log n) parallel time in expectation with O(log n) states per agent, where n is the number of agents. Given a rough knowledge m of the population size n such that m ≥ = log2 n and m=O(log n), this protocol guarantees that exactly one leader is elected and the unique leader is kept forever thereafter."
On Site Fidelity and the Price of Ignorance in Swarm Robotic Central Place Foraging Algorithms,"A key factor limiting the performance of central place foraging algorithms is the awareness of the agent(s) about the location of food items around the nest. We study the ratio of how much time an ignorant agent takes relative to an omniscient forager for complete collection of food items in the arena. This effectively quantifies the penalty each algorithm pays for not knowing (or choosing to ignore information gained about) where the resources are located. We model the effect of depletion of food items from the arena on the foraging efficiency over time and analytically verify that returning to the location of the last food item found strongly helps in counteracting this effect. To the best of our knowledge, these results have only been empirically argued so far."

Single-Source Shortest Paths in the CONGEST Model with Improved Bound,"We improve the time complexity of the single-source shortest path problem for weighted directed graphs (with non-negative integer weights) in the Broadcast CONGEST model of distributed computing. For polynomially bounded edge weights, the state-of-the-art algorithm for this problem requires [EQUATION] rounds [Forster and Nanongkai, FOCS 2018], which is quite far from the known lower bound of [EQUATION] rounds [Elkin, STOC 2014]; here D is the diameter of the underlying network and n is the number of vertices in it. For the approximate version of this problem, Forster and Nanongkai [FOCS 2018] obtained an upper bound of [EQUATION], and stated that achieving the same bound for the exact case remains a major open problem."
On Distributed Listing of Cliques,"We show an Õ(np/(p+2))-round algorithm in the CONGEST model for listing of Kp (a clique with p nodes), for all p = 4, p ≥ 6. For p = 5, we show an Õ(n3/4)-round algorithm."
Distributed Construction of Light Networks,"A t-spanner H of a weighted graph G = (V, E, w) is a subgraph that approximates all pairwise distances up to a factor of t. The lightness of H is defined as the ratio between the weight of H to that of the minimum spanning tree. An (α, β)-Shallow Light Tree (SLT) is a tree of lightness β, that approximates all distances from a designated root vertex up to a factor of α. A long line of works resulted in efficient algorithms that produce (nearly) optimal light spanners and SLTs."
Efficient and Simple Algorithms for Fault-Tolerant Spanners,"It was recently shown that a version of the greedy algorithm gives a construction of fault-tolerant spanners that is size-optimal, at least for vertex faults. However, the algorithm to construct this spanner is not polynomial-time, and the best-known polynomial time algorithm is significantly suboptimal. Designing a polynomial-time algorithm to construct (near-)optimal fault-tolerant spanners was given as an explicit open problem in the two most recent papers on fault-tolerant spanners ([Bodwin, Dinitz, Parter, Vassilevka Williams SODA '18] and [Bodwin, Patel PODC '19]). We give a surprisingly simple algorithm which runs in polynomial time and constructs fault-tolerant spanners that are extremely close to optimal (off by only a linear factor in the stretch) by modifying the greedy algorithm to run in polynomial time. To complement this result, we also give simple distributed constructions in both the LOCAL and CONGEST models."
Distributed Approximation on Power Graphs,"We investigate graph problems in the following setting: we are given a graph G and we are required to solve a problem on G2. While we focus mostly on exploring this theme in the distributed CONGEST model, we also show new results and surprising connections to the centralized model of computation. In the CONGEST model, it is natural to expect that problems on G2 would be quite difficult to solve efficiently on G, due to congestion. However, we show that the picture is both more complicated and more interesting."
Beyond Alice and Bob: Improved Inapproximability for Maximum Independent Set in CONGEST,"By far the most fruitful technique for showing lower bounds for the CONGEST model is reductions to two-party communication complexity. This technique has yielded nearly tight results for various fundamental problems such as distance computations, minimum spanning tree, minimum vertex cover, and more."

Distributed Edge Coloring in Time Quasi-Polylogarithmic in Delta,"The problem of coloring the edges of an n-node graph of maximum degree Δ with 2Δ − 1 colors is one of the key symmetry breaking problems in the area of distributed graph algorithms. While there has been a lot of progress towards the understanding of this problem, the dependency of the running time on Δ has been a longstanding open question. Very recently, Kuhn [SODA '20] showed that the problem can be solved in time [EQUATION]."
How much does randomness help with locally checkable problems?,"Locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) are distributed graph problems in which a solution is globally feasible if it is locally feasible in all constant-radius neighborhoods. Vertex colorings, maximal independent sets, and maximal matchings are examples of LCLs."
"Simple, Deterministic, Constant-Round Coloring in the Congested Clique","We settle the complexity of the (Δ + 1)-coloring and (Δ + 1)-list coloring problems in the CONGESTED CLIQUE model by presenting a simple deterministic algorithm for both problems running in a constant number of rounds. This matches the complexity of the recent breakthrough randomized constant-round (Δ + 1)-list coloring algorithm due to Chang et al. (PODC'19), and significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art O(log Δ)-round deterministic (Δ + 1)-coloring bound of Parter (ICALP'18)."
Compact Distributed Certification of Planar Graphs,"Naor, Parter, and Yogev (SODA 2020) have recently demonstrated the existence of a distributed interactive proof for planarity (i.e., for certifying that a network is planar), using a sophisticated generic technique for constructing distributed IP protocols based on sequential IP protocols. The interactive proof for planarity is based on a distributed certification of the correct execution of any given sequential linear-time algorithm for planarity testing. It involves three interactions between the prover and the randomized distributed verifier (i.e., it is a dMAM protocol), and uses small certificates, on O(log n) bits in n-node networks. We show that a single interaction from the prover suffices, and randomization is unecessary, by providing an explicit description of a proof-labeling scheme for planarity, still using certificates on just O(log n) bits. We also show that there are no proof-labeling schemes --- in fact, even no locally checkable proofs --- for planarity using certificates on o(log n) bits."
Generalizing the Sharp Threshold Phenomenon for the Distributed Complexity of the Lovász Local Lemma,"Recently, Brandt, Maus and Uitto [PODC'19] showed that, in a restricted setting, the dependency of the complexity of the distributed Lovász Local Lemma (LLL) on the chosen LLL criterion exhibits a sharp threshold phenomenon: They proved that, under the LLL criterion p2d < 1, if each random variable affects at most 3 events, the deterministic complexity of the LLL in the LOCAL model is O(d2 + log*n). In stark contrast, under the criterion p2d ≤ 1, there is a randomized lower bound of Ω(log log n) by Brandt et al. [STOC'16] and a deterministic lower bound of Ω(log n) by Chang, Kopelowitz and Pettie [FOCS'16]. Brandt, Maus and Uitto conjectured that the same behavior holds for the unrestricted setting where each random variable affects arbitrarily many events."
Multiple Source Replacement Path Problem,"One of the classical line of work in graph algorithms has been the Replacement Path Problem: given a graph G, s and t, find shortest paths from s to t avoiding each edge e on the shortest path from s to t. These paths are called replacement paths in literature. For an undirected and unweighted graph, (Malik, Mittal, and Gupta, Operation Research Letters, 1989) and (Hershberger and Suri, FOCS 2001) designed an algorithm that solves the replacement path problem in Õ (m + n) time1. It is natural to ask whether we can generalize the replacement path problem: can we find all replacement paths from a source s to all vertices in G? This problem is called the Single Source Replacement Path Problem."
Brief Announcement: Classification of Distributed Binary Labeling Problems,"We present a complete classification of the deterministic distributed time complexity for a family of graph problems: binary labeling problems in trees in the usual LOCAL model of distributed computing. These are locally checkable problems that can be encoded with an alphabet of size two in the edge labeling formalism. Examples of binary labeling problems include sinkless orientation, sinkless and sourceless orientation, 2-vertex coloring, and perfect matching. We show that the complexity of any such problem is in one of the following classes: O(1), Θ(log n), Θ(n), or unsolvable. Furthermore, given the description of any binary labeling problem, we can easily determine in which of the four classes it is and what is an asymptotically optimal algorithm for solving it."
Brief Announcement: Round eliminator: a tool for automatic speedup simulation,"In the last years, the round elimination technique has been successfully used to prove many lower bounds for the LOCAL model of distributed computing. In 2019, Brandt proved that this technique can be theoretically automated: given a locally checkable problem Π that can be solved in T rounds of communication, it is possible to mechanically define a problem Π′ that requires T − 1 rounds, and by repeating this procedure many times one can obtain interesting lower and upper bounds."

Distance-2 Coloring in the CONGEST Model,"We give efficient randomized and deterministic distributed algorithms for computing a distance-2 vertex coloring of a graph G in the CONGEST model. In particular, if Δ is the maximum degree of G, we show that there is a randomized CONGEST model algorithm to compute a distance-2 coloring of G with Δ2 + 1 colors in O(log Δ · log n) rounds. Further if the number of colors is slightly increased to (1 + ∈)Δ2 for some ∈ > 1/polylog n, we show that it is even possible to compute a distance-2 coloring deterministically in polylog n time in the CONGEST model. Finally, we give a O(Δ2 + log* n)-round deterministic CONGEST algorithm to compute distance-2 coloring with Δ2 + 1 colors."
Efficient Deterministic Distributed Coloring with Small Bandwidth,"We show that the (degree + 1)-list coloring problem can be solved deterministically in O(D · log n · log2 Δ) rounds in the CONGEST model, where D is the diameter of the graph, n the number of nodes, and Δ the maximum degree. Using the recent polylogarithmic-time deterministic network decomposition algorithm by Rozhoň and Ghaffari [49], this implies the first efficient (i.e., poly log n-time) deterministic CONGEST algorithm for the (Δ + 1)-coloring and the (degree + 1)-list coloring problem. Previously the best known algorithm required [EQUATION] rounds and was not based on network decompositions."
Want to Gather? No Need to Chatter!,"A team of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node and declare that they have all met. Agents have different labels which are positive integers, and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. The above task is known as gathering and was traditionally considered under the assumption that when some agents are at the same node then they can talk, i.e., exchange currently available information. In this paper we ask the question of whether this ability of talking is needed for gathering. The answer turns out to be no."
Tight Analysis of Asynchronous Rumor Spreading in Dynamic Networks,"The asynchronous rumor spreading algorithm propagates a piece of information, the so-called rumor, in a network. Starting with a single informed node, each node is associated with an exponential time clock with rate 1 and calls a random neighbor in order to possibly exchange the rumor. A well-studied parameter associated with the algorithm is the spread time, which is the first time when all nodes of a network are informed with high probability1. We consider the spread time of the algorithm in any dynamic evolving network, [EQUATION], which is a sequence of n-node graphs with the same set of nodes exposed at discrete time step t = 0, 1. ... We establish upper bounds for the spread time in terms of graph conductance and diligence. For a given connected simple graph G = (V, E), the diligence of cut set [EQUATION] is defined as"
The Energy Complexity of BFS in Radio Networks,"We consider a model of energy complexity in Radio Networks in which transmitting or listening on the channel costs one unit of energy and computation is free. This simplified model captures key aspects of battery-powered sensors: that battery-life is most influenced by transceiver usage, and that at low transmission powers, the actual cost of transmitting and listening are very similar."
Brief Announcement: Improved Distributed Approximations for Maximum-Weight Independent Set,"We present improved algorithms for approximating maximum-weight independent set (MaxIS) in the CONGEST model. Given an input graph, let n and Δ be the number of nodes and maximum degree, respectively, and let MIS(n, Δ) be the running time of finding a maximal independent set (MIS) in the CONGEST model. Bar-Yehuda et al. [PODC 2017] showed that there is an algorithm in the CONGEST model that finds a Δ-approximation for MaxIS in O(MIS(n, Δ) log W) rounds, where W is the maximum weight of a node in the graph, which can be as high as poly(n). Whether their algorithm is deterministic or randomized depends on the MIS algorithm that is used as a black-box. Our results:"
Brief Announcement: Resource Competitive Broadcast against Adaptive Adversary in Multi-channel Radio Networks,"Broadcasting in wireless networks is vulnerable to adversarial jamming. To thwart such behavior, researchers have proposed resource competitive analysis. In this framework, sending, listening, or jamming on one channel for one time slot costs one unit of energy. The adversary can employ arbitrary strategy to disrupt communication, but has a limited energy budget T. The honest nodes, on the other hand, aim to accomplish broadcast while spending only o(T). Previous work has shown, in a C-channels network containing n nodes, each node can receive the message in roughly O(T/C) time, while spending only roughly [EQUATION] energy. However, these algorithms only work for C = O(n), and can only tolerate an oblivious adversary. We improve the result by considering an adaptive adversary and arbitrary values of n and C. In our algorithms, for large T values, each node's runtime is O(T/C), and each node's energy cost is [EQUATION]. The time complexity is asymptotically optimal, while the energy complexity is near optimal in some cases. We use ""epidemic broadcast"" with proper working probabilities to achieve time efficiency and resource competitiveness, and leverage coupling arguments in the analysis to handle the adaptivity of the adversary."

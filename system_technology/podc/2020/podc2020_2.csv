Exponentially Faster Shortest Paths in the Congested Clique,We present improved deterministic algorithms for approximating shortest paths in the Congested Cliqe model of distributed computing. We obtain poly(log log n)-round algorithms for the following problems in unweighted undirected n-vertex graphs:
Truly Tight-in-Δ Bounds for Bipartite Maximal Matching and Variants,"In a recent breakthrough result, Balliu et al. [FOCS'19] proved a deterministic Ω(min(Δ, log n/ log log n))-round and a randomized Ω(min(Δ, log log n/ log log log n))-round lower bound for the complexity of the bipartite maximal matching problem on n-node graphs in the LOCAL model of distributed computing. Both lower bounds are asymptotically tight as a function of the maximum degree Δ."
Lower Bounds for Distributed Sketching of Maximal Matchings and Maximal Independent Sets,"Consider the following distributed graph sketching model: There is a referee and n vertices in an undirected graph G sharing public randomness. Each vertex v only knows its neighborhood in G and the referee receives no input initially. The vertices simultaneously each sends a message, called a sketch, to the referee who then based on the received sketches outputs a solution to some combinatorial problem on G, say, the minimum spanning tree problem."
Seeing Far vs. Seeing Wide: Volume Complexity of Local Graph Problems,"Assume we have a graph problem that is locally checkable but not locally solvable---given a solution we can check that it is feasible by verifying all constant-radius neighborhoods, but to find a feasible solution each node needs to explore the input graph at least up to distance Ω (log n) in order to produce its own part of the solution."
Sleeping is Efficient: MIS in O(1)-rounds Node-averaged Awake Complexity,"Maximal Independent Set (MIS) is one of the fundamental problems in distributed computing. The round (time) complexity of distributed MIS has traditionally focused on the worst-case time for all nodes to finish. The best-known (randomized) MIS algorithms take O(log n) worst-case rounds on general graphs (where n is the number of nodes). Breaking the O(log n) worst-case bound has been a longstanding open problem, while currently the best-known lower bound is [EQUATION] rounds."
Computing Shortest Paths and Diameter in the Hybrid Network Model,"The HYBRID model, introduced in [Augustine et al., SODA '20], provides a theoretical foundation for networks that allow multiple communication modes. The model follows the principles of synchronous message passing, whereas nodes are allowed to use two fundamentally different communication modes. First, a local mode where nodes may exchange arbitrary information per round over edges of a local communication graph G (akin to the LOCAL model). Second, a global mode where every node may exchange O(log n) messages of size O(log n) bits per round with arbitrary nodes in the network. The HYBRID model intends to reflect the conditions of many real hybrid networks, where high-bandwidth but inherently local communication is combined with highly flexible global communication with restricted bandwidth."
Massively Parallel Algorithms for Minimum Cut,"We present two Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) algorithms for the Minimum Cut problem: an O(1)-round exact algorithm with Õ(n) memory per machine, and an O(log n · log log n) round (2 + ε) approximation with Õ(nα) memory per machine, for any positive constant α < 1. Both algorithms use Õ(m) global memory."

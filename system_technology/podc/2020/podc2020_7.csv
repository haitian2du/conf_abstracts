Genuinely Distributed Byzantine Machine Learning,"Machine Learning (ML) solutions are nowadays distributed, according to the so-called server/worker architecture. One server holds the model parameters while several workers train the model. Clearly, such architecture is prone to various types of component failures, which can be all encompassed within the spectrum of a Byzantine behavior. Several approaches have been proposed recently to tolerate Byzantine workers. Yet all require trusting a central parameter server. We initiate in this paper the study of the ""general"" Byzantine-resilient distributed machine learning problem where no individual component is trusted. In particular, we distribute the parameter server computation on several nodes."
Fault-Tolerance in Distributed Optimization: The Case of Redundancy,"This paper considers the problem of Byzantine fault-tolerance in distributed multi-agent optimization. In this problem, each agent has a local cost function. The goal of a distributed optimization algorithm is to allow the agents to collectively compute a minimum of their aggregate cost function. We consider the case when a certain number of agents may be Byzantine faulty. Such faulty agents may not follow a prescribed algorithm, and they may send arbitrary or incorrect information regarding their local cost functions. Unless a fault-tolerance mechanism is employed, traditional distributed optimization algorithms cannot tolerate such faulty agents."
Probably Approximately Knowing,"Whereas deterministic protocols are typically guaranteed to obtain particular goals of interest, probabilistic protocols typically provide only probabilistic guarantees. This paper initiates an investigation of the interdependence between actions and subjective beliefs of agents in a probabilistic setting. In particular, we study what probabilistic beliefs an agent should have when performing actions, in a protocol that satisfies a probabilistic constraint of the form: Condition ϕ should hold with probability at least p when action α is performed. Our main result is that the expected degree of an agent's belief in ϕ when it performs α equals the probability that ϕ holds when α is performed. Indeed, if the threshold of the probabilistic constraint should hold with probability p = 1 − ε2 for some small value of ε then, with probability 1 − ε, when the agent acts it will assign a probabilistic belief no smaller than 1 − ε to the possibility that ϕ holds. In other words, viewing strong belief as, intuitively, approximate knowledge, the agent must Probably Approximately Know (PAK-know) that ϕ is true when it acts."
Positive Aging Admits Fast Asynchronous Plurality Consensus,"We study distributed plurality consensus among n nodes, each of which initially holds one of k opinions. The goal is to eventually agree on the initially dominant opinion. We consider an asynchronous communication model in which each node is equipped with a random clock. Whenever the clock of a node ticks, it may open communication channels to a constant number of other nodes, chosen uniformly at random or from a list of constantly many addresses acquired in previous steps. The tick rates and the delays for establishing communication channels (channel delays) follow some probability distribution. Once a channel is established, communication between nodes can be performed instantaneously."
K-set agreement bounds in round-based models through combinatorial topology,Round-based models are very common message-passing models; combinatorial topology applied to distributed computing provides sweeping results like general lower bounds. We combine both to study the computability of k-set agreement.
Brief Announcement: On Using Null Messages in a Byzantine Setting,"In reliable settings, null messages allow the transfer of information without explicit communication in cases of interest. We investigate the use of null messages in the much more challenging Byzantine model (without signatures). Different ways of using null messages are discussed. One of them, called a silent validation round, can provide processes with global information about all correct sites of the system, without any message exchange. As a case study, we consider optimizing the behavior in failure-free runs of protocols for the classic Byzantine Consensus problem."

"Dumbo-MVBA: Optimal Multi-Valued Validated Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement, Revisited","Multi-valued validated asynchronous Byzantine agreement (MVBA), proposed in the elegant work of Cachin et al. (CRYPTO '01), is fundamental for critical fault-tolerant services such as atomic broadcast in the asynchronous network. It was left as an open problem to asymptotically reduce the O(ℓn2 + λn2 + n3) communication (where n is the number of parties, ℓ is the input length, and λ is the security parameter). Recently, Abraham et al. (PODC '19) removed the n3 term to partially answer the question when input is small. However, in other typical cases, e.g., building atomic broadcast through MVBA, the input length ℓ ≥ λn, and thus the communication is dominated by the ℓn2 term and the problem raised by Cachin et al. remains open."
Revisiting Asynchronous Fault Tolerant Computation with Optimal Resilience,"The celebrated result of Fischer, Lynch and Paterson is the fundamental lower bound for asynchronous fault tolerant computation: any 1-crash resilient asynchronous agreement protocol must have some (possibly measure zero) probability of not terminating. In 1994, Ben-Or, Kelmer and Rabin published a proof-sketch of a lesser known lower bound for asynchronous fault tolerant computation with optimal resilience against a Byzantine adversary: if n ≤ 4t then any t-resilient asynchronous verifiable secret sharing protocol must have some non-zero probability of not terminating."
Asynchronous Byzantine Approximate Consensus in Directed Networks,"This paper considers the problem of approximate consensus in directed asynchronous message-passing networks where some nodes may become Byzantine faulty. We obtain a tight necessary and sufficient condition on the underlying directed communication network for asynchronous Byzantine approximate consensus to be achievable. Interestingly, this condition coincides with the tight condition for synchronous Byzantine exact consensus. Our consensus algorithm may be viewed as a non-trivial generalization of an algorithm previously proposed for the special case of complete networks. The tight condition and techniques identified in the paper shed light on the fundamental properties for solving approximate consensus in asynchronous directed networks."
On the Subject of Non-Equivocation: Defining Non-Equivocation in Synchronous Agreement Systems,"We study non-equivocation in synchronous agreement protocols: the restriction on faulty processes that they cannot act differently towards distinct non-faulty processes. Guarantees of non-equivocation have been used to provide improved fault tolerance in agreement protocols, and various mechanisms for achieving it have been proposed. However, the exact meaning of non-equivocation varies subtly in the literature. In this paper, we propose two different formal notions of non-equivocation: strong and weak. We define both as fault models for synchronous agreement protocols with reliable channels, and we show how the two models yield distinct bounds for the minimal number of communication rounds required and the maximum number of faulty processes tolerable to achieve agreement: 1 round, n > t for strong non-equivocation; and t + 1 rounds, n > 2t for weak non-equivocation. This makes weak non-equivocation the only fault model with a lower bound on fault tolerance of n > 2t for broadcast agreement and interactive consistency, confirming the folklore knowledge that equivocation is, in a sense, the most critical of the Byzantine faults. Finally, we show how the weak and strong non-equivocation fault models relate to well-known agreement problems: strong non-equivocation corresponds to Byzantine broadcast and weak non-equivocation to crusader agreement."
Brief Announcement: Almost-surely Terminating Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement Protocols with a Constant Expected Running Time,"We present almost-surely terminating asynchronous Byzantine agreement (ABA) protocols with a constant expected running time, in two different settings. The first protocol is in a completely asynchronous setting and has non-optimal resilience, outperforming the communication complexity of all the existing protocols in the asynchronous setting. The second protocol has optimal resilience and considers a hybrid setting for the first time, where the parties are available with one synchronous round at the beginning of the protocol execution, after which the network is completely asynchronous."
Brief Announcement: On the Significance of Consecutive Ballots in Paxos,"In this paper, we examine the Paxos protocol and demonstrate how the discrete numbering of ballots can be leveraged to weaken the conditions for learning. Specifically, we define the notion of consecutive ballots and use this to define Consecutive Quorums. Consecutive Quorums weaken the learning criterion such that a learner does not need matching accept messages sent in the same ballot from a majority of acceptors to learn a value. We prove that this modification preserves the original safety and liveness guarantees of Paxos. We define Consecutive Paxos which encapsulates the properties of discrete consecutive ballots. To establish the correctness of these results, in addition to a paper proof, we formally verify the correctness of a State Machine Replication Library built on top of an optimized version of Multi-Paxos modified to reflect Consecutive Paxos."
Brief Announcement: Not a COINcidence: Sub-Quadratic Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement WHP,"King and Saia were the first to break the quadratic word complexity bound for Byzantine Agreement in synchronous systems against an adaptive adversary, and Algorand broke this bound with near-optimal resilience (first in the synchronous model and then with eventual-synchrony). Yet the question of asynchronous sub-quadratic Byzantine Agreement remained open. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to answer this question in the affirmative. A key component of our solution is a shared coin algorithm based on a VRF. A second essential ingredient is VRF-based committee sampling, which we formalize and utilize in the asynchronous model for the first time. Our algorithms work against a delayed-adaptive adversary, which cannot perform after-the-fact removals but has full control of Byzantine processes and full information about communication in earlier rounds. Using committee sampling and our shared coin, we solve Byzantine Agreement with high probability, with a word complexity of Õ(n) and O(1) expected time, breaking the O(n2) bit barrier for asynchronous Byzantine Agreement."
Brief Announcement: Byzantine Agreement with Unknown Participants and Failures,"A set of participants that want to agree on a common opinion despite the presence of malicious or Byzantine participants need to solve an instance of a Byzantine agreement problem. This classic problem has been well studied but most of the existing solutions assume that the participants are aware of n --- the total number of participants in the system --- and f --- the upper bound on the number of Byzantine participants. In this paper, we examine a synchronous system with Byzantine faults where the participants are neither aware of n nor f. The participants have unique identifiers, which are not necessarily consecutive. For such a system, we give algorithms for rotor-coordinator and consensus, both with the resiliency of n > 3f, which is also the optimal resiliency for solving consensus when the participants know n and f. Thus, resiliency is unaffected even if the Byzantine participants can lie about n and f."

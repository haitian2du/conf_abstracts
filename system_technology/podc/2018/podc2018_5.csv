Round- and Message-Optimal Distributed Graph Algorithms,"Distributed graph algorithms that separately optimize for either the number of rounds used or the total number of messages sent have been studied extensively. However, algorithms simultaneously efficient with respect to both measures have been elusive. For example, only very recently was it shown that for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), an optimal message and round complexity is achievable (up to polylog terms) by a single algorithm in the CONGEST model of communication."
"Improved Massively Parallel Computation Algorithms for MIS, Matching, and Vertex Cover","We present O(loglog n) -round algorithms in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model, with Õ (n) memory per machine, that compute a maximal independent set, a 1+ε approximation of maximum matching, and a 2+εapproximation of minimum vertex cover, for any n-vertex graph and any constant \eps>0. These improve the state of the art as follows:"
Distributed Spanner Approximation,"We address the fundamental network design problem of constructing approximate minimum spanners. Our contributions are for the distributed setting, providing both algorithmic and hardness results."
Distributed Approximation of Minimum k-edge-connected Spanning Subgraphs,"In the minimum k-edge-connected spanning subgraph (k-ECSS) problem the goal is to find the minimum weight subgraph resistant to up to k-1 edge failures. This is a central problem in network design, and a natural generalization of the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem. While the MST problem has been studied extensively by the distributed computing community, for k ≥2 less is known in the distributed setting."
Brief Announcement: Distributed Minimum Vertex Coloring and Maximum Independent Set in Chordal Graphs,"We give deterministic distributed (1+ε)-approximation algorithms for Minimum Vertex Coloring and Maximum Independent Set on chordal graphs in the LOCAL model. Our coloring algorithm runs in O( 1/ε logn) rounds, and our independent set algorithm has a runtime of O( 1 ε log( 1/ε ) log? n) rounds. For coloring, existing lower bounds imply that the dependencies on 1/ε and logn are best possible. For independent set, we prove that Ω( 1/ε ) rounds are necessary."
Brief Announcement: Simple and Local Independent Set Approximation,"We bound the performance guarantees that follow from Turán-like bounds for unweighted and weighted independent sets in bounded-degree graphs. In particular, a randomized approach of Boppana forms a simple 1-round distributed algorithm, as well as a streaming and preemptive online algorithm. We show it gives a tight (Δ+1)/2-approximation in unweighted graphs of maximum degree Δ, which is best possible for 1-round distributed algorithms. For weighted graphs, it gives only a (Δ+1)-approximation, but a simple modification results in an asymptotic expected 0.529(Δ+1)-approximation."

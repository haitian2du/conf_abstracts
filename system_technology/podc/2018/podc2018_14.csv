Distributed Coloring in Sparse Graphs with Fewer Colors,"This paper is concerned with efficiently coloring sparse graphs in the distributed setting with as few colors as possible. According to the celebrated Four Color Theorem, planar graphs can be colored with at most 4 colors, and the proof gives a (sequential) quadratic algorithm finding such a coloring. A natural problem is to improve this complexity in the distributed setting. Using the fact that planar graphs contain linearly many vertices of degree at most 6, Goldberg, Plotkin, and Shannon obtained a deterministic distributed algorithm coloring n-vertex planar graphs with 7 colors in O(log n) rounds. Here, we show how to color planar graphs with 6 colors in polylog(n) rounds. Our algorithm indeed works more generally in the list-coloring setting and for sparse graphs (for such graphs we improve by at least one the number of colors resulting from an efficient algorithm of Barenboim and Elkin, at the expense of a slightly worst complexity). Our bounds on the number of colors turn out to be quite sharp in general. Among other results, we show that no distributed algorithm can color every n-vertex planar graph with 4 colors in o(n) rounds."
Improved Distributed Delta-Coloring,"We present a randomized distributed algorithm that computes a Δ- coloring in any non-complete graph with maximum degree Δ ≥ 4 in O(log Δ) +2O( √ log log n) rounds, as well as a randomized algorithm that computes a Δ-coloring in O((log logn)2) rounds when Δ ε [3,O(1)]. Both these algorithms improve on an O(log3 n/ log Δ)- round algorithm of Panconesi and Srinivasan [STOC'1993], which has remained the state of the art for the past 25 years. Moreover, the latter algorithm gets (exponentially) closer to an Ω(log logn) round lower bound of Brandt et al. [STOC'16]."
"Locally-Iterative Distributed (Δ+ 1): -Coloring below Szegedy-Vishwanathan Barrier, and Applications to Self-Stabilization and to Restricted-Bandwidth Models","We consider graph coloring and related problems in the distributed message-passing model. \em Locally-iterative algorithms are especially important in this setting. These are algorithms in which each vertex decides about its next color only as a function of the current colors in its 1 - hop-neighborhood. In STOC'93 Szegedy and Vishwanathan showed that any locally-iterative (Δ + 1)-coloring algorithm requires Ω(Δ log Δ + log^* n) rounds, unless there exists ""a very special type of coloring that can be very efficiently reduced"" \citeSV93."

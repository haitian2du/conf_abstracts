"Lower Bounds for Searching Robots, some Faulty","Suppose we are sending out k robots from √0√ to search the real line at constant speed (with turns) to find a target at an unknown location; f of the robots are faulty, meaning that they fail to report the target although visiting its location (called crash type). The goal is to find the target in time at most Λ|d|√, if the target is located at d, |d| \ge 1√, for √Λas small as possible. We show that this cannot be achieved for Λ < 2\fracρ^ρ (ρ-1)^ρ-1 +1 ρ := \frac2(f+1) k Λ < 2√[k]\frac(k+s)^k+s s^sk^k +1√ which is tight due to earlier work øldnew (see J. Czyzowitz, E. Kranakis, D. Krizanc, L. Narayanan, J. Opatrny, PODC'16, where this problem was introduced). This also gives some better than previously known lower bounds for so-called Byzantine-type faulty robots that may actually wrongly report a target."
Distributed Uniformity Testing,"In the uniformity testing problem, we are given access to samples from some unknown distribution μ on a fixed domain \set1,..,n , and our goal is to distinguish the case where μ is the uniform distribution from the case where μ is ε-far from uniform in L_1 distance. Centralized uniformity testing has been extensively studied, and it is known that Θ(√ /ε^2) samples are necessary and sufficient. In this paper we study distributed uniformity testing : in a network of k nodes, each node i has access to s_i samples from the underlying distribution μ. Our goal is to test uniformity, while minimizing the number of samples per node, as well as the running time. We consider several distributed models: the ŁOCAL model, the \CONGEST model, and a 0-round model where nodes cannot communicate with each other at all. We give upper bounds for each model, and a lower bound for the 0-round model. The key to our results is analyzing the centralized uniformity-testing problem in an unusual error regime, for which we give new upper and lower bounds."
Minor Excluded Network Families Admit Fast Distributed Algorithms,"Distributed network optimization problems, such as minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and shortest path, are an active research area in distributed computing. This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for such problems in the CONGEST model, on networks that exclude a fixed minor. On general graphs, many optimization problems, including the ones mentioned above, require Ω(√ n) rounds of communication in the CONGEST model, even if the network graph has a much smaller diameter. Naturally, the next step in algorithm design is to design efficient algorithms which bypass this lower bound on a restricted class of graphs. Currently, the only known method of doing so uses the low-congestion shortcut framework of Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA'16]. Building off of their work, this paper proves that excluded minor graphs admit high-quality shortcuts, leading to an Õ(D^2) round algorithm for the aforementioned problems, where D is the diameter of the network graph. To work with excluded minor graph families, we utilize the Graph Structure Theorem of Robertson and Seymour. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Graph Structure Theorem has been used for an algorithmic result in the distributed setting. Even though the proof is involved, merely showing the existence of good shortcuts is sufficient to obtain simple, efficient distributed algorithms. In particular, the shortcut framework can efficiently construct near-optimal shortcuts and then use them to solve the optimization problems. This, combined with the very general family of excluded minor graphs, which includes most other important graph classes, makes this result of significant interest."
Brief Announcement: Population Protocols Are Fast,"A population protocol describes a set of state change rules for a population of n indistinguishable finite-state agents (automata), undergoing random pairwise interactions. Within this very basic framework, it is possible to resolve a number of fundamental tasks in distributed computing, including: leader election, aggregate and threshold functions on the population, such as majority computation, and plurality consensus. For the first time, we show that solutions to all of these problems can be obtained quickly using finite-state protocols. For any input, the designed finite-state protocols converge under a fair random scheduler to an output which is correct with high probability in expected O(polylog n) parallel time. We also show protocols which always reach a valid solution, in expected parallel time O(n^ε), where the number of states depends only on the choice of ε>0. The stated time bounds hold for any semi-linear predicate computable in the population protocol framework. The key ingredient of our result is the decentralized design of a hierarchy of phase-clocks, which tick at different rates, with the rates of adjacent clocks separated by a factor of Θ(log n). The construction of this clock hierarchy relies on a new protocol composition technique, combined with an adapted analysis of a self-organizing process of oscillatory dynamics. This clock hierarchy is used to provide nested synchronization primitives, which allow us to view the population in a global manner and design protocols using a high-level imperative programming language with a (limited) capacity for loops and branching instructions."
Brief Announcement: Space-Optimal Naming in Population Protocols,"This paper gives a brief presentation of a comprehensive study on the necessary and sufficient state space conditions for the deterministic naming task in the population protocol model. This problem is studied under various combinations of model assumptions: weak or global fairness, arbitrary or uniform initialization of agents, existence or absence of a distinguishable agent (arbitrarily initialized or not), possibility of breaking symmetry in pair-wise interactions (symmetric or asymmetric transitions). For each possible combination of these assumptions, either an impossibility is proven or the necessary exact number of states (per mobile agent) is determined and an appropriate space-optimal naming protocol is given."
Brief Announcement: A Local Stochastic Algorithm for Separation in Heterogeneous Self-Organizing Particle Systems,"We investigate stochastic, distributed algorithms that can accomplish separation and integration behaviors in self-organizing particle systems, an abstraction of programmable matter. These particle systems are composed of individual computational units known as particles that have limited memory, strictly local communication abilities, and modest computational power, and which collectively solve system-wide problems of movement and coordination. In this work, we extend the usual notion of a particle system to treat heterogeneous systems by considering particles of different colors. We present a fully distributed, asynchronous, stochastic algorithm for separation, where the particle system self-organizes into segregated color classes using only local information about each particle's preference for being near others of the same color. Conversely, by simply changing the particles' preferences, the color classes become well-integrated. We rigorously analyze the convergence of our distributed, stochastic algorithm and prove that under certain conditions separation occurs. We also present simulations demonstrating our algorithm achieves both separation and integration."

Locking Timestamps versus Locking Objects,"We present multiversion timestamp locking (MVTL), a new genre of multiversion concurrency control algorithms for serializable transactions. The key idea behind MVTL is simple: lock individual timestamps instead of locking objects. After presenting a generic MVTL algorithm, we demonstrate MVTL's expressiveness: we give several simple MVTL algorithms that address limitations of current multiversion schemes, by committing transactions that previous schemes would abort, by avoiding the problems of serial aborts or ghost aborts, and by offering a way to prioritize transactions that should not be aborted. We give evidence that, in practice, MVTL-based algorithms can outperform alternative concurrency control schemes."
Relaxed Schedulers Can Efficiently Parallelize Iterative Algorithms,"There has been significant progress in understanding the parallelism inherent to iterative sequential algorithms: for many classic algorithms, the depth of the dependence structure is now well understood, and scheduling techniques have been developed to exploit this shallow dependence structure for efficient parallel implementations. A related, applied research strand has studied methods by which certain iterative task-based algorithms can be efficiently parallelized via relaxed concurrent priority schedulers. These allow for high concurrency when inserting and removing tasks, at the cost of executing superfluous work due to the relaxed semantics of the scheduler. In this work, we take a step towards unifying these two research directions, by showing that there exists a family of relaxed priority schedulers that can efficiently and deterministically execute classic iterative algorithms such as greedy maximal independent set (MIS) and matching. Our primary result shows that, given a randomized scheduler with an expected relaxation factor of k in terms of the maximum allowed priority inversions on a task, and any graph on n vertices, the scheduler is able to execute greedy MIS with only an additive factor of \poly(k) expected additional iterations compared to an exact (but not scalable) scheduler. This counter-intuitive result demonstrates that the overhead of relaxation when computing MIS is not dependent on the input size or structure of the input graph. Experimental results show that this overhead can be clearly offset by the gain in performance due to the highly scalable scheduler. In sum, we present an efficient method to deterministically parallelize iterative sequential algorithms, with provable runtime guarantees in terms of the number of executed tasks to completion."
An Asynchronous Computability Theorem for Fair Adversaries,"This paper proposes a simple topological characterization of a large class of fair adversarial models via affine tasks: sub-complexes of the second iteration of the standard chromatic subdivision. We show that the task computability of a model in the class is precisely captured by iterations of the corresponding affine task. Fair adversaries include, but are not restricted to, the models of wait-freedom, t-resilience, and k-concurrency. Our results generalize and improve all previously derived topological characterizations of the ability of a model to solve distributed tasks."
Population Stability: Regulating Size in the Presence of an Adversary,"We introduce a new coordination problem in distributed computing that we call the population stability problem. A system of agents each with limited memory and communication, as well as the ability to replicate and self-destruct, is subjected to attacks by a worst-case adversary that can at a bounded rate (1) delete agents chosen arbitrarily and (2) insert additional agents with arbitrary initial state into the system. The goal is perpetually to maintain a population whose size is within a constant factor of the target size N. The problem is inspired by the ability of complex biological systems composed of a multitude of memory-limited individual cells to maintain a stable population size in an adverse environment. Such biological mechanisms allow organisms to heal after trauma or to recover from excessive cell proliferation caused by inflammation, disease, or normal development. We present a population stability protocol in a communication model that is a synchronous variant of the population model of Angluin et al. In each round, pairs of agents selected at random meet and exchange messages, where at least a constant fraction of agents is matched in each round. Our protocol uses three-bit messages and Ï‰(log^2 N) states per agent. We emphasize that our protocol can handle an adversary that can both insert and delete agents, a setting in which existing approximate counting techniques do not seem to apply. The protocol relies on a novel coloring strategy in which the population size is encoded in the variance of the distribution of colors. Individual agents can locally obtain a weak estimate of the population size by sampling from the distribution, and make individual decisions that robustly maintain a stable global population size."
Brief Announcement: 2D-Stack -- A Scalable Lock-Free Stack Design that Continuously Relaxes Semantics for Better Performance,"We briefly describe an efficient lock-free concurrent stack design with tunable and tenable relaxed semantics to allow for better performance. The design is tunable and allow for a continuous monotonic trade of weaker semantics for better throughput performance. Concurrent stacks have an inherent scalability bottleneck due to their single access point for both their operations. Elimination and semantics relaxation have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. Semantics relaxation has the potential to reach monotonically very high throughput by continuously trading relaxation for throughput. Previous solutions could not fully leverage this potential. We suggest a new two dimensional design that can achieve this by exploiting disjoint access parallelism in one dimension and locality in the other within tight accuracy bounds. The behaviour of the algorithm is tightly bound. We compare experimentally to previous work, with respect to throughput and relaxed behaviour observed, on different relaxation and concurrency settings. The experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm significantly outperform all other algorithms in terms of performance, also maintain better accuracy in contrast to other designs with relaxed semantics."
Brief Announcement: Performance Prediction for Coarse-Grained Locking,"A standard design pattern found in many concurrent data structures, such as hash tables or ordered containers, is an alternation of parallelizable sections that incur no data conflicts and critical sections that must run sequentially and are protected with locks. A lock can be viewed as a queue that arbitrates the order in which the critical sections are executed, and a natural question is whether we can use stochastic analysis to predict the resulting throughput. As a preliminary evidence to the affirmative, we describe a simple model that can be used to predict the throughput of coarse-grained lock-based algorithms. We show that our model works well for CLH lock, and we expect it to work for other popular lock designs such as TTAS, MCS, etc."
Brief Announcement: Automatic Log Enhancement for Fault Diagnosis,"When systems fail, logs are frequently the only evidence available for underlying fault diagnosis. Consequently, the quality of logs-how well system faults can be reflected by these log messages, is of significant importance. To improve the quality of logs, we propose a novel log enhancement approach which automatically identifies logging points that reflect anomalous behavior during system fault time. We further evaluate our approach with three popular open source projects. Results show that it can significantly improve over 50% accuracy of automatic fault diagnosis on average."

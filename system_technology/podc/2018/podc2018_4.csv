Leveraging Indirect Signaling for Topology Inference and Fast Broadcast,"The physical (or SINR) model of wireless communication is more intricate than radio networks and still not well understood. If two neighbors of a node are transmitting, the node may be able to decode one of the transmissions, depending on the relative nearness of the transmitters. Thus, even the lack of proper reception carries indirect information. We explore here the power of such indirect signaling to infer the approximate topology of the network. In particular, we obtain a polylogarithmic time algorithm to compute a backbone: a set of nodes of constant density that dominates every Îµ-neighborhood. A backbone has wide utility for information dissemination, functioning as a sparse spanner. It also leads to fast broadcast, running in O(Diameter) time after a polylogarithmic precomputation, which previously was only known when additional features such as carrier sense, collision detection, geometric coordinates, or power control were available."
The Energy Complexity of Broadcast,"Energy is often the most constrained resource in networks of batterypowered devices, and as devices become smaller, they spend a larger fraction of their energy on communication (transceiver usage) not computation. As an imperfect proxy for true energy usage, we define energy complexity to be the number of time slots a device transmits/listens; idle time and computation are free."
Deterministic Digital Clustering of Wireless Ad Hoc Networks,"We consider deterministic distributed communication in wireless ad hoc networks of identical devices in the SINR model without predefined infrastructure. Most algorithmic results in this model rely on additional features or capabilities, e.g., randomization, access to geographic coordinates, power control, carrier sensing with various precision of measurements, and interference cancellation. We study a pure scenario, when no such features are available."
"Brief Announcement: Broadcast in Radio Networks, Time vs. Energy Tradeoffs","In wireless networks, consisting of battery-powered devices, energy is a costly resource and most of it is spent on transmitting messages. Broadcast is a problem where a message needs to be transmitted from one node to all other nodes of the network. We study algorithms that can work under limited energy measured as the maximum number of transmissions among all the stations. The goal of the paper is to study tradeoffs between time and energy complexity of broadcast problem in unknown multi-hop radio networks with no collision detection."

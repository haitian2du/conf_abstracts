A Deterministic Distributed Algorithm for Exact Weighted All-Pairs Shortest Paths in Õ(n 3/2 ) Rounds,"We present a deterministic distributed algorithm to compute all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) in an edge-weighted directed or undirected graph. Our algorithm runs in Õ (n^3/2 ) rounds in the Congest model, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. This is the first o(n^2) rounds deterministic distributed algorithm for the weighted APSP problem. Our algorithm is fairly simple and incorporates a deterministic distributed algorithm we develop for computing a 'blocker set' [King99], which has been used earlier in sequential dynamic computation of APSP."
Near-Optimal Distributed Routing with Low Memory,"Distributed \em routing is one of the most central and fundamental problems in the area of Distributed Graph Algorithms. It was extensively studied for almost thirty years. Nevertheless, the currently existing solutions for this problem require either prohibitively large construction (aka preprocessing) time, or prohibitively large memory usage either during the construction or during the routing phase, and suffer from suboptimal labels and tables' sizes. We devise a distributed routing scheme that enjoys the best of all worlds. Specifically, its construction time and memory requirements during the construction phase are near-optimal, and so is also the tradeoff between the sizes of routing tables and labels on the one hand, and the stretch on the other. On the way to this result, we also improve upon existing solutions for the distributed exact \em tree routing problem. Previous solutions require Ω(√ ) memory, and provide tables and labels of size O(log n) and O(log^2 n), respectively. Our solution, on the other hand, requires just O(log n) memory, and has tables of size O(1), and labels of size O(log n). These bounds match the bounds of the best-known centralized solution."
Fair Leader Election for Rational Agents in Asynchronous Rings and Networks,"We study a game theoretic model where a coalition of processors might collude to bias the outcome of the protocol, where we assume that the processors always prefer any legitimate outcome over a non-legitimate one. We show that the problems of Fair Leader Election and Fair Coin Toss are equivalent, and focus on Fair Leader Election."
Leader Election in Well-Connected Graphs,"In this paper, we look at the problem of randomized leader election in synchronous distributed networks with a special focus on the message complexity. We provide an algorithm that solves the implicit version of leader election (where non-leader nodes need not be aware of the identity of the leader) in any general network with O( √ n log7/2 n tmix ) messages and in O(tmix log2 n) time, where n is the number of nodes and tmix refers to the mixing time of a random walk in the network graph G. For several classes of wellconnected networks (that have a large conductance or alternatively small mixing times e.g. expanders, hypercubes, etc), the above result implies extremely efficient (sublinear running time and messages) leader election algorithms. Correspondingly, we show that any substantial improvement is not possible over our algorithm, by presenting an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader election. We show that Ω( √ n/Φ3/4) messages are needed for any leader election algorithm that succeeds with probability at least 1 - o(1), where Φ refers to the conductance of a graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows a dependence between the time and message complexity to solve leader election and the connectivity of the graph G, which is often characterized by the graph's conductance Φ. Apart from the Ω(m) bound in [23] (where m denotes the number of edges of the graph), this work also provides one of the first non-trivial lower bounds for leader election in general networks."
Brief Announcement: Beeping a Time-Optimal Leader Election,"The beeping model is an extremely restrictive broadcast communication model that relies only on carrier sensing. In this model, we solve the deterministic leader election problem with an asymptotically optimal round complexity. Using this result, we obtain an asymptotically optimal randomized leader election algorithm for anonymous networks, as well as improved algorithms for symmetry-breaking and communication primitives. The techniques that we introduce give a new insight as to how local constraints on the exchangeable messages can result in efficient algorithms, when dealing with the beeping model."
Brief Announcement: Graph Exploration Using Constant-Size Memory and Storage,"We consider the exploration problem in undirected graphs without node labels, which requires that a mobile agent initially placed at an arbitrary node visits all nodes and terminates. We assume that both of the agent and nodes are equipped with little memory, and the algorithm cannot use any initial knowledge on the topology of the graph. In this paper, we propose a new deterministic polynomial-time exploration (more precisely, depth-first search) algorithm which can be implemented using only O(1)-bit memory of the agent and O(1)-bit storage for each node. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time exploration algorithm achieving both sublogarithmic memory and sublogarithmic storage. The technical ingredient of our algorithm consists of the idea from the recent progress on small-space DFS algorithms by Asano et al. [ISAAC2014] and Elmasry et al. [STACS2015], and a new distributed backtrack algorithm for DFS paths. The algorithm also includes a new compact (i.e., using O(1)-bit storage) s-t path maintenance mechanism, which may be of independent interest."

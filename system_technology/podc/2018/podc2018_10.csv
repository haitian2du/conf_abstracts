Silence,"The cost of communication is a substantial factor affecting the scalability of many distributed applications. Every message sent can incur a cost in storage, computation, energy and bandwidth. Consequently, reducing the communication costs of distributed applications is highly desirable. The best way to reduce message costs is by communicating without sending any messages whatsoever. This paper initiates a rigorous investigation into the use of silence in synchronous settings, in which processes can fail. We formalize sufficient conditions for information transfer using silence, as well as necessary conditions for particular cases of interest. This allows us to identify message patterns that enable communication through silence. In particular, a pattern called a \em silent choir is identified, and shown to be central to information transfer via silence in failure-prone systems. The power of the new framework is demonstrated on the \em atomic commitment problem (AC). A complete characterization of the tradeoff between message complexity and round complexity in the synchronous model with crash failures is provided, in terms of lower bounds and matching protocols. In particular, a new message-optimal AC protocol is designed using silence, in which processes decide in~3 rounds in the common case. This significantly improves on the best previously known message-optimal AC protocol, in which decisions were performed in Θ(n) rounds."
Almost-Surely Terminating Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement Revisited,"The problem of Byzantine Agreement (BA) is of interest to both distributed computing and cryptography community. Following well-known results from the distributed computing literature, BA problem in the asynchronous network setting encounters inevitable non-termination issues. The impasse is overcome via randomization that allows construction of BA protocols in two flavours of termination guarantee - with overwhelming probability and with probability one. The latter type termed as almost-surely terminating BAs are the focus of this paper. An eluding problem in the domain of almost-surely terminating BAs is achieving a constant expected running time. Our work makes progress in this direction."
Nearly-Tight Analysis for 2-Choice and 3-Majority Consensus Dynamics,"We present improved analyses for two of the well-studied randomized dynamics of stabilizing consensus, namely 2-choice and 3-majority. The resulting bounds are tight up to logarithmic factors. In the latter case, this answers an open question of Becchetti et al. [SODA'16]. Consider a distributed system of n nodes, each initially holding an opinion in \1, 2, ...., k\ . The system should converge to a setting where all (non-corrupted) nodes hold the same opinion. This consensus opinion should be valid, meaning that it should be among the initially supported opinions, and the (fast) convergence should happen even in the presence of a malicious adversary who can corrupt a bounded number of nodes per round and in particular modify their opinions. Two of the well-studied distributed algorithms for this problem work as follows: In both of these dynamics, each node gathers the opinion of three nodes and sets its new opinion equal to the majority of this set. In the 2-choice dynamics, the three nodes are the node itself and two random nodes and ties are broken towards the node's own opinion. In the 3-majority dynamics, the three nodes are selected at random and ties are broken randomly. Becchetti et al. [SODA'16] showed that the 3-majority dynamics converges to consensus in O((k^2\sq√rtlog n + klog n)(k+log n)) rounds, even in the presence of a limited adversary, for k bounded by some polynomial of n. We prove that, even with a stronger adversary, the convergence happens within O(klog n) rounds, both for 3-majority and 2-choice. For 3-majority, this bound is known to be optimal for k=\tildeO (√ ). More generally, we prove that 3-majority converges always in Õ (n^2/3 ) time, improving on a Õ (n^3/4 ) upper bound of Berenbrink et al. [PODC'17]."
Sublinear Message Bounds for Randomized Agreement,This paper focuses on understanding the message complexity of randomized agreement in synchronous distributed networks. We focus on the so-called implicit agreement problem where each node starts with an input value (0 or 1) and at the end one or more nodes should decide on a common input value which should be equal to some node's input value (there can be undecided nodes). Implicit agreement is a generalization of the fundamental agreement and leader election problems.
Tight Bounds for Asymptotic and Approximate Consensus,"We study the performance of asymptotic and approximate consensus algorithms under harsh environmental conditions. The asymptotic consensus problem requires a set of agents to repeatedly set their outputs such that the outputs converge to a common value within the convex hull of initial values. This problem, and the related approximate consensus problem, are fundamental building blocks in distributed systems where exact consensus among agents is not required or possible, e.g., man-made distributed control systems, and have applications in the analysis of natural distributed systems, such as flocking and opinion dynamics. We prove tight lower bounds on the contraction rates of asymptotic consensus algorithms in dynamic networks, from which we deduce bounds on the time complexity of approximate consensus algorithms. In particular, the obtained bounds show optimality of asymptotic and approximate consensus algorithms presented in [Charron-Bost et al., ICALP'16] for certain dynamic networks, including the weakest dynamic network model in which asymptotic and approximate consensus are solvable. As a corollary we also obtain asymptotically tight bounds for asymptotic consensus in the classical asynchronous model with crashes. Central to our lower bound proofs is an extended notion of valency, the set of reachable limits of an asymptotic consensus algorithm starting from a given configuration. We further relate topological properties of valencies to the solvability of exact consensus, shedding some light on the relation of these three fundamental problems in dynamic networks."

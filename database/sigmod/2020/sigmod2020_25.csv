Application Driven Graph Partitioning,"Graph partitioning is crucial to parallel computations on large graphs. The choice of partitioning strategies has strong impact on not only the performance of graph algorithms, but also the design of the algorithms. For an algorithm of our interest, what partitioning strategy fits it the best and improves its parallel execution? Is it possible to develop graph algorithms with partition transparency, such that the algorithms work under different partitions without changes? This paper aims to answer these questions. We propose an application-driven hybrid partitioning strategy that, given a graph algorithm A, learns a cost model for A as polynomial regression. We develop partitioners that given the learned cost model, refine an edge-cut or vertex-cut partition to a hybrid partition and reduce the parallel cost of A. Moreover, we identify a general condition under which graph-centric algorithms are partition transparent. We show that a number of graph algorithms can be made partition transparent. Using real-life and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify that our partitioning strategy improves the performance of a variety of graph computations, up to 22.5 times."
Progressive Top-K Nearest Neighbors Search in Large Road Networks,"Computing top-k nearest neighbors (kNN) is a fundamental problem in road networks. Existing solutions either need a complicated parameter configuration in index construction or incur high costs when scanning an unbounded number of vertices in query processing. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-free index-based solution for the kNN query based on the concept of tree decomposition in large road networks. Based on our index structure, we propose an efficient and progressive algorithm that returns each result in a bounded delay. We also optimize the index structure, which improves the efficiency of both index construction and index maintenance in large road networks. We conduct extensive experiments to show the efficiency of our proposed algorithms and the effectiveness of our optimization techniques in real-world road networks from ten regions."
Memory-Aware Framework for Efficient Second-Order Random Walk on Large Graphs,"Second-order random walk is an important technique for graph analysis. Many applications use it to capture higher-order patterns in the graph, thus improving the model accuracy. However, the memory explosion problem of this technique hinders it from analyzing large graphs. When processing a billion-edge graph like Twitter, existing solutions (e.g., alias method) of the second-order random walk may take up 1796TB memory. Such high memory overhead comes from the memory-unaware strategies for node sampling across the graph. In this paper, to clearly study the efficiency of various node sampling methods in the context of second-order random walk, we design a cost model, and then propose a new node sampling method following the acceptance-rejection paradigm to achieve a better balance between memory and time cost. Further, to guarantee the efficiency of the second-order random walk within arbitrary memory budgets, we propose a memory-aware framework on the basis of the cost model. The framework applies a cost-based optimizer to assign desirable node sampling method for each node in the graph within a memory budget while minimizing the time cost. Finally, we provide general programming interfaces for users to benefit from the memory-aware framework easily. The empirical studies demonstrate that our memory-aware framework is robust with respect to memory and is able to achieve considerable efficiency by reducing 90% of the memory cost."
Hub Labeling for Shortest Path Counting,"The notion of shortest path is fundamental in graph analytics. While many works have devoted to devising efficient distance oracles to compute the shortest distance between any vertices s and t, we study the problem of efficiently counting the number of shortest paths between s and t in light of its applications in tasks such as betweenness-related analysis. Specifically, we propose a hub labeling scheme based on hub pushing and discuss several graph reduction techniques to reduce the index size. Furthermore, we prove several theoretical results on the performance of the scheme for some special graph classes. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms. In particular, a query evaluation takes only hundreds of microseconds in average for graphs with up to hundreds of millions of edges. We report our findings in this paper."
CHASSIS: Conformity Meets Online Information Diffusion,"Online information diffusion generates huge volumes of social activities (eg. tweets, retweets posts, comments, likes) among individuals. Existing information diffusion modeling techniques are oblivious to conformity of individuals during the diffusion process, a fundamental human trait according to social psychology theories. Intuitively, conformity captures the extent to which an individual complies with social norms or expectations. In this paper, we present a novel framework called chassis to characterize online information diffusion by bridging classical information diffusion model with conformity from social psychology. To this end, we first extend ""Hawkes Process"", a well-known statistical technique utilized to model information diffusion, to quantitatively capture two flavors of conformity, informational conformity and normative conformity, hidden in activity sequences. Next, we present a novel semi-parametric inference approach to learn the proposed model. Experimental study with real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of chassis to state-of-the-art conformity-unaware information diffusion models."

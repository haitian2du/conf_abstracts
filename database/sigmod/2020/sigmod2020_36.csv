Improving Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search through Learned Adaptive Early Termination,"In applications ranging from image search to recommendation systems, the problem of identifying a set of ""similar"" real-valued vectors to a query vector plays a critical role. However, retrieving these vectors and computing the corresponding similarity scores from a large database is computationally challenging. Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search relaxes the guarantee of exactness for efficiency by vector compression and/or by only searching a subset of database vectors for each query. Searching a larger subset increases both accuracy and latency. State-of-the-art ANN approaches use fixed configurations that apply the same termination condition (the size of subset to search) for all queries, which leads to undesirably high latency when trying to achieve the last few percents of accuracy. We find that due to the index structures and the vector distributions, the number of database vectors that must be searched to find the ground-truth nearest neighbor varies widely among queries. Critically, we further identify that the intermediate search result after a certain amount of search is an important runtime feature that indicates how much more search should be performed. To achieve a better tradeoff between latency and accuracy, we propose a novel approach that adaptively determines search termination conditions for individual queries. To do so, we build and train gradient boosting decision tree models to learn and predict when to stop searching for a certain query. These models enable us to achieve the same accuracy with less total amount of search compared to the fixed configurations. We apply the learned adaptive early termination to state-of-the-art ANN approaches, and evaluate the end-to-end performance on three million to billion-scale datasets. Compared with fixed configurations, our approach consistently improves the average end-to-end latency by up to 7.1 times faster under the same high accuracy targets. Our approach is open source at github.com/efficient/faiss-learned-termination."
Theoretically-Efficient and Practical Parallel DBSCAN,"The DBSCAN method for spatial clustering has received significant attention due to its applicability in a variety of data analysis tasks. There are fast sequential algorithms for DBSCAN in Euclidean space that take O(n≈Çog n) work for two dimensions, sub-quadratic work for three or more dimensions, and can be computed approximately in linear work for any constant number of dimensions. However, existing parallel DBSCAN algorithms require quadratic work in the worst case. This paper bridges the gap between theory and practice of parallel DBSCAN by presenting new parallel algorithms for Euclidean exact DBSCAN and approximate DBSCAN that match the work bounds of their sequential counterparts, and are highly parallel (polylogarithmic depth). We present implementations of our algorithms along with optimizations that improve their practical performance. We perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our algorithms on a variety of datasets and parameter settings. Our experiments on a 36-core machine with two-way hyper-threading show that our implementations outperform existing parallel implementations by up to several orders of magnitude, and achieve speedups of up to 33x over the best sequential algorithms."
A Relational Matrix Algebra and its Implementation in a Column Store,"Analytical queries often require a mixture of relational and linear algebra operations applied to the same data. This poses a challenge to analytic systems that must bridge the gap between relations and matrices. Previous work has mainly strived to fix the problem at the implementation level. This paper proposes a principled solution at the logical level. We introduce the relational matrix algebra (RMA), which seamlessly integrates linear algebra operations into the relational model and eliminates the dichotomy between matrices and relations. RMA is closed: All our relational matrix operations are performed on relations and result in relations; no additional data structure is required. Our implementation in MonetDB shows the feasibility of our approach, and empirical evaluations suggest that in-database analytics performs well for mixed workloads."
Locality-Sensitive Hashing Scheme based on Longest Circular Co-Substring,"Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is one of the most popular methods for c-Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (c-ANNS) in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel LSH scheme based on the Longest Circular Co-Substring (LCCS) search framework (LCCS-LSH) with a theoretical guarantee. We introduce a novel concept of LCCS and a new data structure named Circular Shift Array (CSA) for k-LCCS search. The insight of LCCS search framework is that close data objects will have a longer LCCS than the far-apart ones with high probability. LCCS-LSH is LSH-family-independent, and it supports c-ANNS with different kinds of distance metrics. We also introduce a multi-probe version of LCCS-LSH and conduct extensive experiments over five real-life datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that LCCS-LSH outperforms state-of-the-art LSH schemes."
Continuously Adaptive Similarity Search,"Similarity search is the basis for many data analytics techniques, including k-nearest neighbor classification and outlier detection. Similarity search over large data sets relies on i) a distance metric learned from input examples and ii) an index to speed up search based on the learned distance metric. In interactive systems, input to guide the learning of the distance metric may be provided over time. As this new input changes the learned distance metric, a naive approach would adopt the costly process of re-indexing all items after each metric change. In this paper, we propose the first solution, called OASIS, to instantaneously adapt the index to conform to a changing distance metric without this prohibitive re-indexing process. To achieve this, we prove that locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) provides an invariance property, meaning that an LSH index built on the original distance metric is equally effective at supporting similarity search using an updated distance metric as long as the transform matrix learned for the new distance metric satisfies certain properties. This observation allows OASIS to avoid recomputing the index from scratch in most cases. Further, for the rare cases when an adaption of the LSH index is shown to be necessary, we design an efficient incremental LSH update strategy that re-hashes only a small subset of the items in the index. In addition, we develop an efficient distance metric learning strategy that incrementally learns the new metric as inputs are received. Our experimental study using real world public datasets confirms the effectiveness of OASIS at improving the accuracy of various similarity search-based data analytics tasks by instantaneously adapting the distance metric and its associated index in tandem, while achieving an up to 3 orders of magnitude speedup over the state-of-art techniques."

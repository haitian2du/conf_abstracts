Elastic Machine Learning Algorithms in Amazon SageMaker,"There is a large body of research on scalable machine learning (ML). Nevertheless, training ML models on large, continuously evolving datasets is still a difficult and costly undertaking for many companies and institutions. We discuss such challenges and derive requirements for an industrial-scale ML platform. Next, we describe the computational model behind Amazon SageMaker, which is designed to meet such challenges. SageMaker is an ML platform provided as part of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and supports incremental training, resumable and elastic learning as well as automatic hyperparameter optimization. We detail how to adapt several popular ML algorithms to its computational model. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation on large datasets, comparing SageMaker to several scalable, JVM-based implementations of ML algorithms, which we significantly outperform with regard to computation time and cost."
Timon: A Timestamped Event Database for Efficient Telemetry Data Processing and Analytics,"With the increasing demand for real-time system monitoring and tracking in various contexts, the amount of time-stamped event data grows at an astonishing rate. Analytics on time-stamped events must be real time and the aggregated results need to be accurate even when data arrives out of order. Unfortunately, frequent occurrences of out-of-order data will significantly slow down the processing, and cause a large delay in the query response. Timon is a timestamped event database that aims to support aggregations and handle late arrivals both correctly (i.e., upholding the exactly-once semantics) and efficiently. Our insight is that a broad range of applications can be implemented with data structures and corresponding operators that satisfy associative and commutative properties. Records arriving after the low watermark are appended to Timon directly, allowing aggregations to be performed lazily. To improve query efficiency, Timon maintains a TS-LSM-Tree, which keeps the most recent data in memory and contains a time-partitioning tree on disk for high-volume data accumulated over long time span. Besides, Timon supports materialized aggregation views and correlation analysis across multiple streams. Timon has been successfully deployed at Alibaba Cloud and is a critical building block for Alibaba cloud's continuous monitoring and anomaly analysis infrastructure."
Vertica-ML: Distributed Machine Learning in Vertica Database,"A growing number of companies rely on machine learning as a key element for gaining a competitive edge from their collected Big Data. An in-database machine learning system can provide many advantages in this scenario, e.g., eliminating the overhead of data transfer, avoiding the maintenance costs of a separate analytical system, and addressing data security and provenance concerns. In this paper, we present our distributed machine learning subsystem within the Vertica database. This subsystem, Vertica-ML, includes machine learning functionalities with SQL API which cover a complete data science workflow as well as model management. We treat machine learning models in Vertica as first-class database objects like tables and views; therefore, they enjoy a similar mechanism for archiving and managing. We explain the architecture of the subsystem, and present a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the machine learning algorithms implemented on top of it."
Database Workload Capacity Planning using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning,"When procuring or administering any I.T. system or a component of an I.T. system, it is crucial to understand the computational resources required to run the critical business functions that are governed by any Service Level Agreements. Predicting the resources needed for future consumption is like looking into the proverbial crystal ball. In this paper we look at the forecasting techniques in use today and evaluate if those techniques are applicable to the deeper layers of the technological stack such as clustered database instances, applications and groups of transactions that make up the database workload. The approach has been implemented to use supervised machine learning to identify traits such as reoccurring patterns, shocks and trends that the workloads exhibit and account for those traits in the forecast. An experimental evaluation shows that the approach we propose reduces the complexity of performing a forecast, and accurate predictions have been produced for complex workloads."
The Machine Learning Bazaar: Harnessing the ML Ecosystem for Effective System Development,"As machine learning is applied more widely, data scientists often struggle to find or create end-to-end machine learning systems for specific tasks. The proliferation of libraries and frameworks and the complexity of the tasks have led to the emergence of ""pipeline jungles"" - brittle, ad hoc ML systems. To address these problems, we introduce the Machine Learning Bazaar, a new framework for developing machine learning and automated machine learning software systems. First, we introduce ML primitives, a unified API and specification for data processing and ML components from different software libraries. Next, we compose primitives into usable ML pipelines, abstracting away glue code, data flow, and data storage. We further pair these pipelines with a hierarchy of AutoML strategies - Bayesian optimization and bandit learning. We use these components to create a general-purpose, multi-task, end-to-end AutoML system that provides solutions to a variety of data modalities (image, text, graph, tabular, relational, etc.) and problem types (classification, regression, anomaly detection, graph matching, etc.). We demonstrate 5 real-world use cases and 2 case studies of our approach. Finally, we present an evaluation suite of 456 real-world ML tasks and describe the characteristics of 2.5 million pipelines searched over this task suite."

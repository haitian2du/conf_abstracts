Automatically Generating Data Exploration Sessions Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential yet highly demanding task. To get a head start before exploring a new dataset, data scientists often prefer to view existing EDA notebooks -- illustrative, curated exploratory sessions, on the same dataset, that were created by fellow data scientists who shared them online. Unfortunately, such notebooks are not always available (e.g., if the dataset is new or confidential). To address this, we present ATENA, a system that takes an input dataset and auto-generates a compelling exploratory session, presented in an EDA notebook. We shape EDA into a control problem, and devise a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture to effectively optimize the notebook generation. Though ATENA uses a limited set of EDA operations, our experiments show that it generates useful EDA notebooks, allowing users to gain actual insights."
Auto-Suggest: Learning-to-Recommend Data Preparation Steps Using Data Science Notebooks,"Data preparation is widely recognized as the most time-consuming process in modern business intelligence (BI) and machine learning (ML) projects. Automating complex data preparation steps (e.g., Pivot, Unpivot, Normalize-JSON, etc.)holds the potential to greatly improve user productivity, and has therefore become a central focus of research. We propose a novel approach to ""auto-suggest"" contextualized data preparation steps, by ""learning"" from how data scientists would manipulate data, which are documented by data science notebooks widely available today. Specifically, we crawled over 4M Jupyter notebooks on GitHub, and replayed them step-by-step, to observe not only full input/output tables (data-frames) at each step, but also the exact data-preparation choices data scientists make that they believe are best suited to the input data (e.g., how input tables are Joined/Pivoted/Unpivoted, etc.). By essentially ""logging"" how data scientists interact with diverse tables, and using the resulting logs as a proxy of ""ground truth"", we can learn-to-recommend data preparation steps best suited to given user data, just like how search engines (Google or Bing) leverage their click-through logs to learn-to-rank documents. This data-driven and log-driven approach leverages the ""collective wisdom"" of data scientists embodied in the notebooks, and is shown to significantly outperform strong baselines including commercial systems in terms of accuracy."
IDEBench: A Benchmark for Interactive Data Exploration,"In recent years, many query processing techniques have been developed to better support interactive data exploration (IDE) of large structured datasets. To evaluate and compare database engines in terms of how well they support such workloads, experimenters have mostly used self-designed evaluation procedures rather than established benchmarks. In this paper we argue that this is due to the fact that the workloads and metrics of popular analytical benchmarks such as TPC-H or TPC-DS were designed for traditional performance reporting scenarios, and do not capture distinctive IDE characteristics. Guided by the findings of several user studies we present a new benchmark called IDEBench, designed to evaluate database engines based on common IDE workflows and metrics that matter to the end-user. We demonstrate the applicability of IDEBench through a number of experiments with five different database engines, and present and discuss our findings."
Database Benchmarking for Supporting Real-Time Interactive Querying of Large Data,"In this paper, we present a new benchmark to validate the suitability of database systems for interactive visualization workloads. While there exist proposals for evaluating database systems on interactive data exploration workloads, none rely on real user traces for database benchmarking. To this end, our long term goal is to collect user traces that represent workloads with different exploration characteristics. In this paper, we present an initial benchmark that focuses on ""crossfilter""-style applications, which are a popular interaction type for data exploration and a particularly demanding scenario for testing database system performance. We make our benchmark materials, including input datasets, interaction sequences, corresponding SQL queries, and analysis code, freely available as a community resource, to foster further research in this area: https://osf.io/9xerb/?view_only=81de1a3f99d04529b6b173a3bd5b4d23."
Benchmarking Spreadsheet Systems,"Spreadsheet systems are used for storing and analyzing data across domains by programmers and non-programmers alike.While spreadsheet systems have continued to support increasingly large datasets, they are prone to hanging and freezing while performing computations even on much smaller ones. We present a benchmarking study that evaluates and compares the performance of three popular systems, Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, and Google Sheets, on a range of canonical spreadsheet computation operations. We find that spreadsheet systems lack interactivity for several operations, on datasets well below their advertised scalability limits. We further evaluate whether spreadsheet systems adopt database optimization techniques such as indexing, intelligent data layout, and incremental and shared computation,to efficiently execute computation operations. We outline several ways future spreadsheet systems can be redesigned to offer interactive response times on large datasets."

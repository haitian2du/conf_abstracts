Querying Shared Data with Security Heterogeneity,"There has been increasing need for secure data sharing. In practice a group of data owners often adopt a heterogeneous security scheme under which each pair of parties decide their own protocol to share data with diverse levels of trust. The scheme also keeps track of how the data is used. This paper studies distributed SQL query answering in the heterogeneous security setting. We define query plans by incorporating toll functions determined by data sharing agreements and reflected in the use of various security facilities. We formalize query answering as a bi-criteria optimization problem, to minimize both data sharing toll and parallel query evaluation cost. We show that this problem is PSPACE-hard for SQL and Σ_3^p-hard for SPC, and it is in NEXPTIME. Despite the hardness, we develop a set of approximate algorithms to generate distributed query plans that minimize data sharing toll and reduce parallel evaluation cost. Using real-life and synthetic data, we empirically verify the effectiveness, scalability and efficiency of our algorithms."
SAGMA: Secure Aggregation Grouped by Multiple Attributes,"Encryption can protect data in outsourced databases -- in the cloud -- while still enabling query processing over the encrypted data. However, the processing leaks information about the data specific to the type of query, e.g., aggregation queries. Aggregation over user-defined groups using SQL's GROUP BY clause is extensively used in data analytics, e.g., to calculate the total number of visitors each month or the average salary in each department. The information leaked, e.g., the access pattern to a group, may reveal the group's frequency enabling simple, yet detrimental leakage-abuse attacks. In this work we present SAGMA -- an encryption scheme for performing secure aggregation grouped by multiple attributes. The querier can choose any combination of one or multiple attributes in the GROUP BY clause among the set of all grouping attributes. The encryption scheme only stores semantically secure ciphertexts at the cloud and query processing hides the access pattern, i.e., the frequency of each group. We implemented our scheme and our evaluation results underpin its practical feasibility."
Cryptϵ: Crypto-Assisted Differential Privacy on Untrusted Servers,"Differential privacy (DP) is currently the de-facto standard for achieving privacy in data analysis, which is typically implemented either in the ""central"" or ""local"" model. The local model has been more popular for commercial deployments as it does not require a trusted data collector. This increased privacy, however, comes at the cost of utility and algorithmic expressibility as compared to the central model. In this work, we propose, Cryptε, a system and programming framework that (1) achieves the accuracy guarantees and algorithmic expressibility of the central model (2) without any trusted data collector like in the local model. Cryptε achieves the ""best of both worlds"" by employing two non-colluding untrusted servers that run DP programs on encrypted data from the data owners. In theory, straightforward implementations of DP programs using off-the-shelf secure multi-party computation tools can achieve the above goal. However, in practice, they are beset with many challenges like poor performance and tricky security proofs. To this end, Cryptε allows data analysts to author logical DP programs that are automatically translated to secure protocols that work on encrypted data. These protocols ensure that the untrusted servers learn nothing more than the noisy outputs, thereby guaranteeing DP (for computationally bounded adversaries) for all Cryptε programs. Cryptε supports a rich class of DP programs that can be expressed via a small set of transformation and measurement operators followed by arbitrary post-processing. Further, we propose performance optimizations leveraging the fact that the output is noisy. We demonstrate Cryptε's practical feasibility with extensive empirical evaluations on real world datasets."
Estimating Numerical Distributions under Local Differential Privacy,"When collecting information, local differential privacy (LDP) relieves the concern of privacy leakage from users' perspective, as user's private information is randomized before sent to the aggregator. We study the problem of recovering the distribution over a numerical domain while satisfying LDP. While one can discretize a numerical domain and then apply the protocols developed for categorical domains, we show that taking advantage of the numerical nature of the domain results in better trade-off of privacy and utility. We introduce a new reporting mechanism, called the square wave (SW) mechanism, which exploits the numerical nature in reporting. We also develop an Expectation Maximization with Smoothing (EMS) algorithm, which is applied to aggregated histograms from the SW mechanism to estimate the original distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach, SW with EMS, consistently outperforms other methods in a variety of utility metrics."
FalconDB: Blockchain-based Collaborative Database,"Nowadays an emerging class of applications are based oncollaboration over a shared database among different entities. However, the existing solutions on shared database may require trust on others, have high hardware demand that is unaffordable for individual users, or have relatively low performance. In other words, there is a trilemma among security, compatibility and efficiency. In this paper, we present FalconDB, which enables different parties with limited hardware resources to efficiently and securely collaborate on a database. FalconDB adopts database servers with verification interfaces accessible to clients and stores the digests for query/update authentications on a blockchain. Using blockchain as a consensus platform and a distributed ledger, FalconDB is able to work without any trust on each other. Meanwhile, FalconDB requires only minimal storage cost on each client, and provides anywhere-available, real-time and concurrent access to the database. As a result, FalconDB over-comes the disadvantages of previous solutions, and enables individual users to participate in the collaboration with high efficiency, low storage cost and blockchain-level security guarantees."

Cleaning Denial Constraint Violations through Relaxation,"Data cleaning is a time-consuming process that depends on the data analysis that users perform. Existing solutions treat data cleaning as a separate offline process that takes place before analysis begins. Applying data cleaning before analysis assumes a priori knowledge of the inconsistencies and the query workload, thereby requiring effort on understanding and cleaning the data that is unnecessary for the analysis. We propose an approach that performs probabilistic repair of denial constraint violations on-demand, driven by the exploratory analysis that users perform. We introduce Daisy, a system that seamlessly integrates data cleaning into the analysis by relaxing query results. Daisy executes analytical query-workloads over dirty data by weaving cleaning operators into the query plan. Our evaluation shows that Daisy adapts to the workload and outperforms traditional offline cleaning on both synthetic and real-world workloads."
On Multiple Semantics for Declarative Database Repairs,"We study the problem of database repairs through a rule-based framework that we refer to as Delta Rules. Delta rules are highly expressive and allow specifying complex, cross-relations repair logic associated with Denial Constraints, Causal Rules, and allowing to capture Database Triggers of interest. We show that there are no one-size-fits-all semantics for repairs in this inclusive setting, and we consequently introduce multiple alternative semantics, presenting the case for using each of them. We then study the relationships between the semantics in terms of their output and the complexity of computation. Our results formally establish the tradeoff between the permissiveness of the semantics and its computational complexity. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework in capturing multiple data repair scenarios for an academic search database and the TPC-H databases, showing how using different semantics affects the repair in terms of size and runtime, and examining the relationships between the repairs. We also compare our approach with SQL triggers and a state-of-the-art data repair system."
Discovery Algorithms for Embedded Functional Dependencies,"Embedded functional dependencies (eFDs) advance data management applications by data completeness and integrity requirements. We show that the discovery problem of eFDs is NP-complete, W[2]-complete in the output, and has a minimum solution space that is larger than the maximum solution space for functional dependencies. Nevertheless, we use novel data structures and search strategies to develop row-efficient, column-efficient, and hybrid algorithms for eFD discovery. Our experiments demonstrate that the algorithms scale well in terms of their design targets, and that ranking the eFDs by the number of redundant data values they cause can provide useful guidance in identifying meaningful eFDs for applications. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of introducing completeness requirements and ranking by the number of redundant data values for approximate and genuine functional dependencies."
SCODED: Statistical Constraint Oriented Data Error Detection,"Statistical Constraints (SCs) play an important role in statistical modeling and analysis. This paper brings the concept to data cleaning and studies how to leverage SCs for error detection. SCs provide a novel approach that has various application scenarios and works harmoniously with downstream statistical modeling. Entailment relationships between SCs and integrity constraints provide analytical insight into SCs. We develop SCODED, an SC-Oriented Data Error Detection system, comprising two key components: (1) SC Violation Detection : checks whether an SC is violated on a given dataset, and (2) Error Drill Down : identifies the top-k records that contribute most to the violation of an SC. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that SCs are effective in detecting data errors that violate them, compared to state-of-the-art approaches."
A Statistical Perspective on Discovering Functional Dependencies in Noisy Data,"We study the problem of discovering functional dependencies (FD) from a noisy data set. We adopt a statistical perspective and draw connections between FD discovery and structure learning in probabilistic graphical models. We show that discovering FDs from a noisy data set is equivalent to learning the structure of a model over binary random variables, where each random variable corresponds to a functional of the data set attributes. We build upon this observation to introduce FDX a conceptually simple framework in which learning functional dependencies corresponds to solving a sparse regression problem. We show that FDX can recover true functional dependencies across a diverse array of real-world and synthetic data sets, even in the presence of noisy or missing data. We find that FDX scales to large data instances with millions of tuples and hundreds of attributes while it yields an average F1 improvement of 2x against state-of-the-art FD discovery methods."

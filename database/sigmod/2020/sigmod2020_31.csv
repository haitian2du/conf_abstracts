The Solution Distribution of Influence Maximization: A High-level Experimental Study on Three Algorithmic Approaches,"Influence maximization is among the most fundamental algorithmic problems in social influence analysis. Over the last decade, a great effort has been devoted to developing efficient algorithms for influence maximization, so that identifying the ""best"" algorithm has become a demanding task. In SIGMOD'17, Arora, Galhotra, and Ranu reported benchmark results on eleven existing algorithms and demonstrated that there is no single state-of-the-art offering the best trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality. In this paper, we report a high-level experimental study on three well-established algorithmic approaches for influence maximization, referred to as Oneshot, Snapshot, and Reverse Influence Sampling (RIS). Different from Arora et al., our experimental methodology is so designed that we examine the distribution of random solutions, characterize the relation between the sample number and the actual solution quality, and avoid implementation dependencies. Our main findings are as follows: 1. For a sufficiently large sample number, we obtain a unique solution regardless of algorithms. 2. The average solution quality of Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS improves at the same rate up to scaling of sample number. 3. Oneshot requires more samples than Snapshot, and Snapshot requires fewer but larger samples than RIS. We discuss the time efficiency when conditioning Oneshot, Snapshot, and RIS to be of identical accuracy. Our conclusion is that Oneshot is suitable only if the size of available memory is limited, and RIS is more efficient than Snapshot for large networks; Snapshot is preferable for small, low-probability networks."
Influence Maximization Revisited: Efficient Reverse Reachable Set Generation with Bound Tightened,"Given a social network G with n nodes and m edges, a positive integer k, and a cascade model C, the influence maximization (IM) problem asks for k nodes in G such that the expected number of nodes influenced by the k nodes under cascade model C is maximized. The state-of-the-art approximate solutions run in O(k(n+m)log(n)/ε2) expected time while returning a (1-1/e -ε) approximate solution with at least 1-1/n probability. A key phase of these IM algorithms is the random reverse reachable (RR) set generation, and this phase significantly affects the efficiency and scalability of the state-of-the-art IM algorithms. In this paper, we present a study on this key phase and propose an efficient random RR set generation algorithm under IC model. With the new algorithm, we show that the expected running time of existing IM algorithms under IC model can be improved to O(k· n log(n)/ε2), when for any node v, the total weight of its incoming edges is no larger than a constant. Moreover, existing approximate IM algorithms suffer from scalability issues in high influence networks where the size of random RR sets is usually quite large. We tackle this challenging issue by reducing the average size of random RR sets without sacrificing the approximation guarantee. The proposed solution is orders of magnitude faster than states of the art as shown in our experiment."
Truss-based Community Search over Large Directed Graphs,"Community search enables personalized community discovery and has wide applications in large real-world graphs. While community search has been extensively studied for undirected graphs, the problem for directed graphs has received attention only recently. However, existing studies suffer from several drawbacks, e.g., the vertices with varied in-degrees and out-degrees cannot be included in a community at the same time. To address the limitations, in this paper, we systematically study the problem of community search over large directed graphs. We start by presenting a novel community model, called D-truss, based on two distinct types of directed triangles, i.e., flow triangle and cycle triangle. The D-truss model brings nice structural and computational properties and has many advantages in comparison with the existing models. With this new model, we then formulate the D-truss community search problem, which is proved to be NP-hard. In view of its hardness, we propose two efficient 2-approximation algorithms, named Global and Local, that run in polynomial time yet with quality guarantee. To further improve the efficiency of the algorithms, we devise an indexing method based on D-truss decomposition. Consequently, the D-truss community search can be solved upon the D-truss index without time-consuming accesses to the original graph. Experimental studies on real-world graphs with ground-truth communities validate the quality of the solutions we obtain and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."
Densely Connected User Community and Location Cluster Search in Location-Based Social Networks,"Searching for a community based on query nodes in a graph is a fundamental problem and has been extensively investigated. Most of the existing approaches focus on finding a community in a social network, and very few studies consider location-based social networks where users can check in locations. In this paper we propose the GeoSocial Community Search problem (GCS) which aims to find a social community and a cluster of spatial locations that are densely connected in a location-based social network simultaneously. The GCS can be useful for marketing and user/location recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to find a social community and a cluster of spatial locations that are densely connected from location-based social networks. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and is not in APX, unless P = NP. To solve this problem, we propose three algorithms: core-based basic algorithm, top-down greedy removing algorithm, and an expansion algorithm. Finally, we report extensive experimental studies that offer insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solutions."
Global Reinforcement of Social Networks: The Anchored Coreness Problem,"The stability of a social network has been widely studied as an important indicator for both the network holders and the participants. Existing works on reinforcing networks focus on a local view, e.g., the anchored k-core problem aims to enlarge the size of the k-core with a fixed input k. Nevertheless, it is more promising to reinforce a social network in a global manner: considering the engagement of every user (vertex) in the network. Since the coreness of a user has been validated as the ""best practice"" for capturing user engagement, we propose and study the anchored coreness problem in this paper: anchoring a small number of vertices to maximize the coreness gain (the total increment of coreness) of all the vertices in the network. We prove the problem is NP-hard and show it is more challenging than the existing local-view problems. An efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed with novel techniques on pruning search space and reusing the intermediate results. Extensive experiments on real-life data demonstrate that our model is effective for reinforcing social networks and our algorithm is efficient."

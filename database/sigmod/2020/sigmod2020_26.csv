Architecture-Intact Oracle for Fastest Path and Time Queries on Dynamic Spatial Networks,"Given two vertices of interest (POIs) s and t on a spatial network, a distance (path) query returns the shortest network distance (shortest path) from s to t. This query has a variety of applications in practice and is a fundamental operation for many database and data mining algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient distance and path oracle on dynamic road networks using the randomization technique. Our oracle has a good performance in practice and remarkably, and at the same time, it has a favorable theoretical bound. Specifically, it has O(n log2 n) (resp. O(n log2n)) preprocessing time (resp. space) and O(log4n log log n) (resp. O(log4n log log n+l)) distance query time (resp. shortest path query time) as well as O(log3n) update time with high probability (w.h.p.), where n is the number of vertices in the spatial network and l is the number of edges on the shortest path. Our experiments show that the existing oracles suffer from a huge updating time that renders them impractical and our oracle enjoys a negligible updating time and meanwhile has comparable query time and indexing cost with the best existing oracle."
Data Series Progressive Similarity Search with Probabilistic Quality Guarantees,"Existing systems dealing with the increasing volume of data series cannot guarantee interactive response times, even for fundamental tasks such as similarity search. Therefore, it is necessary to develop analytic approaches that support exploration and decision making by providing progressive results, before the final and exact ones have been computed. Prior works lack both efficiency and accuracy when applied to large-scale data series collections. We present and experimentally evaluate a new probabilistic learning-based method that provides quality guarantees for progressive Nearest Neighbor (NN) query answering. We provide both initial and progressive estimates of the final answer that are getting better during the similarity search, as well suitable stopping criteria for the progressive queries. Experiments with synthetic and diverse real datasets demonstrate that our prediction methods constitute the first practical solution to the problem, significantly outperforming competing approaches."
A GPU-friendly Geometric Data Model and Algebra for Spatial Queries,"The availability of low cost sensors has led to an unprecedented growth in the volume of spatial data. Unfortunately, the time required to evaluate even simple spatial queries over large data sets greatly hampers our ability to interactively explore these data sets and extract actionable insights. While Graphics Processing Units~(GPUs) are increasingly being used to speed up spatial queries, existing solutions have two important drawbacks: they are often tightly coupled to the specific query types they target, making it hard to adapt them for other queries; and since their design is based on CPU-based approaches, it can be difficult to effectively utilize all the benefits provided by the GPU. As a first step towards making GPU spatial query processing mainstream, we propose a new model that represents spatial data as geometric objects and define an algebra consisting of GPU-friendly composable operators that operate over these objects. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the proposed algebra and present a proof-of-concept prototype that supports a subset of the operators, which shows that it is orders of magnitude faster than a CPU-based implementation and outperforms custom GPU-based approaches."
Debunking Four Long-Standing Misconceptions of Time-Series Distance Measures,"Distance measures are core building blocks in time-series analysis and the subject of active research for decades. Unfortunately, the most detailed experimental study in this area is outdated (over a decade old) and, naturally, does not reflect recent progress. Importantly, this study (i) omitted multiple distance measures, including a classic measure in the time-series literature; (ii) considered only a single time-series normalization method; and (iii) reported only raw classification error rates without statistically validating the findings, resulting in or fueling four misconceptions in the time-series literature. Motivated by the aforementioned drawbacks and our curiosity to shed some light on these misconceptions, we comprehensively evaluate 71 time-series distance measures. Specifically, our study includes (i) 8 normalization methods; (ii) 52 lock-step measures; (iii) 4 sliding measures; (iv) 7 elastic measures; (v) 4 kernel functions; and (vi) 4 embedding measures. We extensively evaluate these measures across 128 time-series datasets using rigorous statistical analysis. Our findings debunk four long-standing misconceptions that significantly alter the landscape of what is known about existing distance measures. With the new foundations in place, we discuss open challenges and promising directions."
MIRIS: Fast Object Track Queries in Video,"Video databases that enable queries with object-track predicates are useful in many applications. Such queries include selecting objects that move from one region of the camera frame to another (e.g., finding cars that turn right through a junction) and selecting objects with certain speeds (e.g., finding animals that stop to drink water from a lake). Processing such predicates efficiently is challenging because they involve the movement of an object over several video frames. We propose a novel query-driven tracking approach that integrates query processing with object tracking to efficiently process object track queries and address the computational complexity of object detection methods. By processing video at low framerates when possible, but increasing the framerate when needed to ensure high-accuracy on a query, our approach substantially speeds up query execution. We have implemented query-driven tracking in MIRIS, a video query processor, and compare MIRIS against four baselines on a diverse dataset consisting of five sources of video and nine distinct queries. We find that, at the same accuracy, MIRIS accelerates video query processing by 9x on average over the IOU tracker, an overlap-based tracking-by-detection method used in existing video database systems."

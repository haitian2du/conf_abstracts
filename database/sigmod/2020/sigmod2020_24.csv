Vista: Optimized System for Declarative Feature Transfer from Deep CNNs at Scale,"Scalable systems for machine learning (ML) are largely siloed into dataflow systems for structured data and deep learning systems for unstructured data. This gap has left workloads that jointly analyze both forms of data with poor systems support, leading to both low system efficiency and grunt work for users. We bridge this gap for an important class of such workloads: feature transfer from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for analyzing images along with structured data. Executing feature transfer on scalable dataflow and deep learning systems today faces two key systems issues: inefficiency due to redundant computations and crash-proneness due to mismanaged memory. We present Vista, a new data system that resolves these issues by elevating this workload to a declarative level on top of dataflow and deep learning systems. Vista automatically optimizes the configuration and execution of this workload to reduce both computational redundancy and the potential for workload crashes. Experiments on real datasets show that apart from making feature transfer easier, Vista avoids workload crashes and reduces runtimes by 58% to 92% compared to baselines."
Optimizing Machine Learning Workloads in Collaborative Environments,"Effective collaboration among data scientists results in high-quality and efficient machine learning (ML) workloads. In a collaborative environment, such as Kaggle or Google Colabratory, users typically re-execute or modify published scripts to recreate or improve the result. This introduces many redundant data processing and model training operations. Reusing the data generated by the redundant operations leads to the more efficient execution of future workloads. However, existing collaborative environments lack a data management component for storing and reusing the result of previously executed operations. In this paper, we present a system to optimize the execution of ML workloads in collaborative environments by reusing previously performed operations and their results. We utilize a so-called Experiment Graph (EG) to store the artifacts, i.e., raw and intermediate data or ML models, as vertices and operations of ML workloads as edges. In theory, the size of EG can become unnecessarily large, while the storage budget might be limited. At the same time, for some artifacts, the overall storage and retrieval cost might outweigh the recomputation cost. To address this issue, we propose two algorithms for materializing artifacts based on their likelihood of future reuse. Given the materialized artifacts inside EG, we devise a linear-time reuse algorithm to find the optimal execution plan for incoming ML workloads. Our reuse algorithm only incurs a negligible overhead and scales for the high number of incoming ML workloads in collaborative environments. Our experiments show that we improve the run-time by one order of magnitude for repeated execution of the workloads and 50% for the execution of modified workloads in collaborative environments."
GOGGLES: Automatic Image Labeling with Affinity Coding,"Generating large labeled training data is becoming the biggest bottleneck in building and deploying supervised machine learning models. Recently, the data programming paradigm has been proposed to reduce the human cost in labeling training data. However, data programming relies on designing labeling functions which still requires significant domain expertise. Also, it is prohibitively difficult to write labeling functions for image datasets as it is hard to express domain knowledge using raw features for images (pixels). We propose affinity coding, a new domain-agnostic paradigm for automated training data labeling. The core premise of affinity coding is that the affinity scores of instance pairs belonging to the same class on average should be higher than those of pairs belonging to different classes, according to some affinity functions. We build the GOGGLES system that implements affinity coding for labeling image datasets by designing a novel set of reusable affinity functions for images, and propose a novel hierarchical generative model for class inference using a small development set. We compare GOGGLES with existing data programming systems on 5 image labeling tasks from diverse domains. GOGGLES achieves labeling accuracies ranging from a minimum of 71% to a maximum of 98% without requiring any extensive human annotation. In terms of end-to-end performance, GOGGLES outperforms the state-of-the-art data programming system Snuba by 21% and a state-of-the-art few-shot learning technique by 5%, and is only 7% away from the fully supervised upper bound."
DeepSqueeze: Deep Semantic Compression for Tabular Data,"With the rapid proliferation of large datasets, efficient data compression has become more important than ever. Columnar compression techniques (e.g., dictionary encoding, run-length encoding, delta encoding) have proved highly effective for tabular data, but they typically compress individual columns without considering potential relationships among columns, such as functional dependencies and correlations. Semantic compression techniques, on the other hand, are designed to leverage such relationships to store only a subset of the columns necessary to infer the others, but existing approaches cannot effectively identify complex relationships across more than a few columns at a time. We propose DeepSqueeze, a novel semantic compression framework that can efficiently capture these complex relationships within tabular data by using autoencoders to map tuples to a lower-dimensional representation. DeepSqueeze also supports guaranteed error bounds for lossy compression of numerical data and works in conjunction with common columnar compression formats. Our experimental evaluation uses real-world datasets to demonstrate that DeepSqueeze can achieve over a 4x size reduction compared to state-of-the-art alternatives."
TRACER: A Framework for Facilitating Accurate and Interpretable Analytics for High Stakes Applications,"In high stakes applications such as healthcare and finance analytics, the interpretability of predictive models is required and necessary for domain practitioners to trust the predictions. Traditional machine learning models, e.g., logistic regression (LR), are easy to interpret in nature. However, many of these models aggregate time-series data without considering the temporal correlations and variations. Therefore, their performance cannot match up to recurrent neural network (RNN) based models, which are nonetheless difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework TRACER to facilitate accurate and interpretable predictions, with a novel model TITV devised for healthcare analytics and other high stakes applications such as financial investment and risk management. Different from LR and other existing RNN-based models, TITV is designed to capture both the time-invariant and the time-variant feature importance using a feature-wise transformation subnetwork and a self-attention subnetwork, for the feature influence shared over the entire time series and the time-related importance respectively. Healthcare analytics is adopted as a driving use case, and we note that the proposed TRACER is also applicable to other domains, e.g., fintech. We evaluate the accuracy of TRACER extensively in two real-world hospital datasets, and our doctors/clinicians further validate the interpretability of TRACER in both the patient level and the feature level. Besides, TRACER is also validated in a critical financial application. The experimental results confirm that TRACER facilitates both accurate and interpretable analytics for high stakes applications."

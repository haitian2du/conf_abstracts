A Comprehensive Benchmark Framework for Active Learning Methods in Entity Matching,"Entity Matching (EM) is a core data cleaning task, aiming to identify different mentions of the same real-world entity. Active learning is one way to address the challenge of scarce labeled data in practice, by dynamically collecting the necessary examples to be labeled by an Oracle and refining the learned model (classifier) upon them. In this paper, we build a unified active learning benchmark framework for EM that allows users to easily combine different learning algorithms with applicable example selection algorithms. The goal of the framework is to enable concrete guidelines for practitioners as to what active learning combinations will work well for EM. Towards this, we perform comprehensive experiments on publicly available EM datasets from product and publication domains to evaluate active learning methods, using a variety of metrics including EM quality, #labels and example selection latencies. Our most surprising result finds that active learning with fewer labels can learn a classifier of comparable quality as supervised learning. In fact, for several of the datasets, we show that there is an active learning combination that beats the state-of-the-art supervised learning result. Our framework also includes novel optimizations that improve the quality of the learned model by roughly 9% in terms of F1-score and reduce example selection latencies by up to 10Ã— without affecting the quality of the model."
ZeroER: Entity Resolution using Zero Labeled Examples,"Entity resolution (ER) refers to the problem of matching records in one or more relations that refer to the same real-world entity. While supervised machine learning (ML) approaches achieve the state-of-the-art results, they require a large amount of labeled examples that are expensive to obtain and often times infeasible. We investigate an important problem that vexes practitioners: is it possible to design an effective algorithm for ER that requires Zero labeled examples, yet can achieve performance comparable to supervised approaches? In this paper, we answer in the affirmative through our proposed approach dubbed ZeroER. Our approach is based on a simple observation --- the similarity vectors for matches should look different from that of unmatches. Operationalizing this insight requires a number of technical innovations. First, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model based on Gaussian Mixture Models for learning the match and unmatch distributions. Second, we propose an adaptive regularization technique customized for ER that ameliorates the issue of feature overfitting. Finally, we incorporate the transitivity property into the generative model in a novel way resulting in improved accuracy. On five benchmark ER datasets, we show that ZeroER greatly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches and achieves comparable performance to supervised approaches."
Towards Interpretable and Learnable Risk Analysis for Entity Resolution,"Machine-learning-based entity resolution has been widely studied. However, some entity pairs may be mislabeled by machine learning models and existing studies do not study the risk analysis problem -- predicting and interpreting which entity pairs are mislabeled. In this paper, we propose an interpretable and learnable framework for risk analysis, which aims to rank the labeled pairs based on their risks of being mislabeled. We first describe how to automatically generate interpretable risk features, and then present a learnable risk model and its training technique. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on real data. Our extensive experiments have shown that the learning risk model can identify the mislabeled pairs with considerably higher accuracy than the existing alternatives."
SLIM: Scalable Linkage of Mobility Data,"We present a scalable solution to link entities across mobility datasets using their spatio-temporal information. This is a fundamental problem in many applications such as linking user identities for security, understanding privacy limitations of location based services, or producing a unified dataset from multiple sources for urban planning. Such integrated datasets are also essential for service providers to optimise their services and improve business intelligence. In this paper, we first propose a mobility based representation and similarity computation for entities. An efficient matching process is then developed to identify the final linked pairs, with an automated mechanism to decide when to stop the linkage. We scale the process with a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) based approach that significantly reduces candidate pairs for matching. To realize the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques in practice, we introduce an algorithm called SLIM. In the experimental evaluation, SLIM outperforms the two existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision and recall. Moreover, the LSH-based approach brings two to four orders of magnitude speedup."
Monotonic Cardinality Estimation of Similarity Selection: A Deep Learning Approach,"In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of utilizing deep learning for cardinality estimation of similarity selection. Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data management applications, especially for query optimization. Moreover, in some applications the estimated cardinality is supposed to be consistent and interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any data type and distance function. Our method consists of a feature extraction model and a regression model. The feature extraction model transforms original data and threshold to a Hamming space, in which a deep learning-based regression model is utilized to exploit the incremental property of cardinality w.r.t. the threshold for both accuracy and monotonicity. We develop a training strategy tailored to our model as well as techniques for fast estimation. We also discuss how to handle updates. We demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of our method through experiments, and show how it improves the performance of a query optimizer."

Organizing Data Lakes for Navigation,"We consider the problem of creating an effective navigation structure over a data lake. We define an organization as a navigation graph that contains nodes representing sets of attributes within a data lake and edges indicating subset relationships among nodes. We propose the data lake organization problem as the problem of finding an organization that allows a user to most effectively navigate a data lake. We present a new probabilistic model of how users interact with an organization and propose an approximate algorithm for the data lake organization problem. We show the effectiveness of the algorithm on both a real data lake containing data from open data portals and on a benchmark that contains rich metadata emulating the observed characteristics of real data lakes. Through a formal user study, we show that navigation can help users find relevant tables that cannot be found by keyword search."
Finding Related Tables in Data Lakes for Interactive Data Science,"Many modern data science applications build on data lakes, schema-agnostic repositories of data files and data products that offer limited organization and management capabilities. There is a need to build data lake search capabilities into data science environments, so scientists and analysts can find tables, schemas, workflows, and datasets useful to their task at hand. We develop search and management solutions for the Jupyter Notebook data science platform, to enable scientists to augment training data, find potential features to extract, clean data, and find joinable or linkable tables. Our core methods also generalize to other settings where computational tasks involve execution of programs or scripts."
Web Data Extraction using Hybrid Program Synthesis: A Combination of Top-down and Bottom-up Inference,"Automatic synthesis of web data extraction programs has been explored in a variety of settings, but in practice there remain various robustness and usability challenges. In this work we present a novel program synthesis approach which combines the benefits of deductive and enumerative synthesis strategies, yielding a semi-supervised technique with which concise programs expressible in standard languages can be synthesized from very few examples. We demonstrate improvement over existing techniques in terms of overall accuracy, number of examples required, and program complexity. Our method has been deployed as a web extraction feature in the mass market Microsoft Power BI product."
SPARQL Rewriting: Towards Desired Results,"Recent years witnessed the emergence of various applications on knowledge graphs, which are often represented as RDF graphs. However, due to the lack of data schema and the complexity of SPARQL language, there is usually a gap between the user's real desire and the actual meaning of a SPARQL query, especially when the query itself is complicated. In this paper, we try to narrow this gap by modifying a given query with a set of modifiers, so that its result approaches a user-provided example set. Specifically, we model this problem as two individual sub-problems, query-restricting, and query-relaxing, both of which are shown to be NP-hard. We further prove that unless P=NP, query-restricting has no polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS), and query-relaxing has no polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm. Despite their hardness, we propose a (1-1/Îµ)-approximation method for query-restricting and 2 heuristics for query-relaxing. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world knowledge graphs to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solutions."
Realistic Re-evaluation of Knowledge Graph Completion Methods: An Experimental Study,"In the active research area of employing embedding models for knowledge graph completion, particularly for the task of link prediction, most prior studies used two benchmark datasets FB15k and WN18 in evaluating such models. Most triples in these and other datasets in such studies belong to reverse and duplicate relations which exhibit high data redundancy due to semantic duplication, correlation or data incompleteness. This is a case of excessive data leakage---a model is trained using features that otherwise would not be available when the model needs to be applied for real prediction. There are also Cartesian product relations for which every triple formed by the Cartesian product of applicable subjects and objects is a true fact. Link prediction on the aforementioned relations is easy and can be achieved with even better accuracy using straightforward rules instead of sophisticated embedding models. A more fundamental defect of these models is that the link prediction scenario, given such data, is non-existent in the real-world. This paper is the first systematic study with the main objective of assessing the true effectiveness of embedding models when the unrealistic triples are removed. Our experiment results show these models are much less accurate than what we used to perceive. Their poor accuracy renders link prediction a task without truly effective automated solution. Hence, we call for re-investigation of possible effective approaches."

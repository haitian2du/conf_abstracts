Fast Searchable Encryption With Tunable Locality,"Searchable encryption (SE) allows a client to outsource a dataset to an untrusted server while enabling the server to answer keyword queries in a private manner. SE can be used as a building block to support more expressive private queries such as range/point and boolean queries, while providing formal security guarantees. To scale SE to big data using external memory, new schemes with small locality have been proposed, where locality is defined as the number of non-continuous reads that the server makes for each query. Previous space-efficient SE schemes achieve optimal locality by increasing the read efficiency-the number of additional memory locations (false positives) that the server reads per result item. This can hurt practical performance."
Cryptanalysis of Comparable Encryption in SIGMOD'16,"Comparable Encryption proposed by Furukawa (ESORICS 2013, CANS 2014) is a variant of order-preserving encryption (OPE) and order-revealing encryption (ORE); we cannot compare a ciphertext of v and another ciphertext of v', but we can compare a ciphertext of v and a token of b and compare a token of $b$ and another token of b'. Comparable encryption allows us to implement range and point queries while keeping the order of v's as secret as possible."
BLOCKBENCH: A Framework for Analyzing Private Blockchains,"Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms."

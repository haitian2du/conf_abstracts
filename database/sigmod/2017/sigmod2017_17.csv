Two-Level Sampling for Join Size Estimation,"Join size estimation is a critical step in query optimization, and has been extensively studied in the literature. Among the many techniques, sampling based approaches are particularly appealing, due to their ability to handle arbitrary selection predicates. In this paper, we propose a new sampling algorithm for join size estimation, called two-level sampling, which combines the advantages of three previous sampling methods while making further improvements. Both analytical and empirical comparisons show that the new algorithm outperforms all the previous algorithms on a variety of joins, including primary key-foreign key joins, many-to-many joins, and multi-table joins. The new sampling algorithm is also very easy to implement, requiring just one pass over the data. It only relies on some basic statistical information about the data, such as the â„“k-norms and the heavy hitters."
A General-Purpose Counting Filter: Making Every Bit Count,"Approximate Membership Query (AMQ) data structures, such as the Bloom filter, quotient filter, and cuckoo filter, have found numerous applications in databases, storage systems, networks, computational biology, and other domains. However, many applications must work around limitations in the capabilities or performance of current AMQs, making these applications more complex and less performant. For example, many current AMQs cannot delete or count the number of occurrences of each input item, take up large amounts of space, are slow, cannot be resized or merged, or have poor locality of reference and hence perform poorly when stored on SSD or disk. This paper proposes a new general-purpose AMQ, the counting quotient filter (CQF). The CQF supports approximate membership testing and counting the occurrences of items in a data set. This general-purpose AMQ is small and fast, has good locality of reference, scales out of RAM to SSD, and supports deletions, counting (even on skewed data sets), resizing, merging, and highly concurrent access. The paper reports on the structure's performance on both manufactured and application-generated data sets."
BePI: Fast and Memory-Efficient Method for Billion-Scale Random Walk with Restart,"How can we measure similarity between nodes quickly and accurately on large graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good measure, and has been used in various data mining applications including ranking, recommendation, link prediction and community detection. However, existing methods for computing RWR do not scale to large graphs containing billions of edges; iterative methods are slow in query time, and preprocessing methods require too much memory."

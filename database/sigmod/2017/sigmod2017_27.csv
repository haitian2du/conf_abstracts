Pufferfish Privacy Mechanisms for Correlated Data,"Many modern databases include personal and sensitive correlated data, such as private information on users connected together in a social network, and measurements of physical activity of single subjects across time. However, differential privacy, the current gold standard in data privacy, does not adequately address privacy issues in this kind of data."
Bolt-on Differential Privacy for Scalable Stochastic Gradient Descent-based Analytics,"While significant progress has been made separately on analytics systems for scalable stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and private SGD, none of the major scalable analytics frameworks have incorporated differentially private SGD. There are two inter-related issues for this disconnect between research and practice: (1) low model accuracy due to added noise to guarantee privacy, and (2) high development and runtime overhead of the private algorithms. This paper takes a first step to remedy this disconnect and proposes a private SGD algorithm to address both issues in an integrated manner. In contrast to the white-box approach adopted by previous work, we revisit and use the classical technique of output perturbation to devise a novel ``bolt-on'' approach to private SGD. While our approach trivially addresses (2), it makes (1) even more challenging. We address this challenge by providing a novel analysis of the L2-sensitivity of SGD, which allows, under the same privacy guarantees, better convergence of SGD when only a constant number of passes can be made over the data. We integrate our algorithm, as well as other state-of-the-art differentially private SGD, into Bismarck, a popular scalable SGD-based analytics system on top of an RDBMS. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm can be easily integrated, incurs virtually no overhead, scales well, and most importantly, yields substantially better (up to 4X) test accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms on many real datasets."
Pythia: Data Dependent Differentially Private Algorithm Selection,"Differential privacy has emerged as a preferred standard for ensuring privacy in analysis tasks on sensitive datasets. Recent algorithms have allowed for significantly lower error by adapting to properties of the input data. These so-called data-dependent algorithms have different error rates for different inputs. There is now a complex and growing landscape of algorithms without a clear winner that can offer low error over all datasets. As a result, the best possible error rates are not attainable in practice, because the data curator cannot know which algorithm to select prior to actually running the algorithm."
Utility Cost of Formal Privacy for Releasing National Employer-Employee Statistics,"National statistical agencies around the world publish tabular summaries based on combined employer-employee (ER-EE) data. The privacy of both individuals and business establishments that feature in these data are protected by law in most countries. These data are currently released using a variety of statistical disclosure limitation (SDL) techniques that do not reveal the exact characteristics of particular employers and employees, but lack provable privacy guarantees limiting inferential disclosures."

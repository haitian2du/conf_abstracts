Access Path Selection in Main-Memory Optimized Data Systems: Should I Scan or Should I Probe?,"The advent of columnar data analytics engines fueled a series of optimizations on the scan operator. New designs include column-group storage, vectorized execution, shared scans, working directly over compressed data, and operating using SIMD and multi-core execution. Larger main memories and deeper cache hierarchies increase the efficiency of modern scans, prompting a revisit of the question of access path selection."
Optimization of Disjunctive Predicates for Main Memory Column Stores,"Optimization of disjunctive predicates is a very challenging task which has been vastly neglected by the research community and commercial databases. In this work, we focus on the complex problem of optimizing disjunctive predicates by means of the bypass processing technique. In bypass processing, selection operators split the input tuple stream into two disjoint output streams: the true-stream with tuples that satisfy the selection predicate and the false-stream with tuples that do not. Bypass processing is crucial in avoiding expensive predicates whenever the outcome of the query predicate can be determined by evaluating the less expensive ones."
A Top-Down Approach to Achieving Performance Predictability in Database Systems,"While much of the research on transaction processing has focused on improving overall performance in terms of throughput and mean latency, surprisingly less attention has been given to performance predictability: how often individual transactions exhibit execution latency far from the mean. Performance predictability is increasingly important when transactions lie on the critical path of latency-sensitive applications, enterprise software, or interactive web services."

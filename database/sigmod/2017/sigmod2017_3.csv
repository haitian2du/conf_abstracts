Enabling Signal Processing over Data Streams,"Internet of Things applications analyze the data coming from large networks of sensor devices using relational and signal processing operations and running the same query logic over groups of sensor signals. To support such increasingly important scenarios, many data management systems integrate with numerical frameworks like R. Such solutions, however, incur significant performance penalties as relational data processing engines and numerical tools operate on fundamentally different data models with expensive inter-communication mechanisms. In addition, none of these solutions supports efficient real-time and incremental analysis."
Complete Event Trend Detection in High-Rate Event Streams,"Event processing applications from financial fraud detection to health care analytics continuously execute event queries with Kleene closure to extract event sequences of arbitrary, statically unknown length, called Complete Event Trends (CETs). Due to common event sub-sequences in CETs, either the responsiveness is delayed by repeated computations or an exorbitant amount of memory is required to store partial results. To overcome these limitations, we define the CET graph to compactly encode all CETs matched by a query. Based on the graph, we define the spectrum of CET detection algorithms from CPU-optimal to memory-optimal. We find the middle ground between these two extremes by partitioning the graph into time-centric graphlets and caching partial CETs per graphlet to enable effective reuse of these intermediate results. We reveal cost monotonicity properties of the search space of graph partitioning plans. Our CET optimizer leverages these properties to prune significant portions of the search to produce a partitioning plan with minimal CPU costs yet within the given memory limit. Our experimental study demonstrates that our CET detection solution achieves up to 42--fold speed-up even under rigid memory constraints compared to the state-of-the-art techniques in diverse scenarios."

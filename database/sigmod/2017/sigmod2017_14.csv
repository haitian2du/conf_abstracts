Discovering Your Selling Points: Personalized Social Influential Tags Exploration,"Social influence has attracted significant attention owing to the prevalence of social networks (SNs). In this paper, we study a new social influence problem, called personalized social tags exploration (PITEX), to help any user in the SN explore how she influences the network. Given a target user, it finds a size-k tag set that maximizes this user's social influence. We prove the problem is NP-hard to be approximated within any constant ratio. To solve it, we introduce a sampling-based framework, which has an approximation ratio of 1-ε over 1+ε with high probabilistic guarantee. To speedup the computation, we devise more efficient sampling techniques and propose best-effort exploration to quickly prune tag sets with small influence. To further enable instant exploration, we devise a novel index structure and develop effective pruning and materialization techniques. Experimental results on real large-scale datasets validate our theoretical findings and show high performances of our proposed methods."
Coarsening Massive Influence Networks for Scalable Diffusion Analysis,"Fueled by the increasing popularity of online social networks, social influence analysis has attracted a great deal of research attention in the past decade. The diffusion process is often modeled using influence graphs, and there has been a line of research that involves algorithmic problems in influence graphs. However, the vast size of today's real-world networks raises a serious issue with regard to computational efficiency."
Debunking the Myths of Influence Maximization: An In-Depth Benchmarking Study,"Influence maximization (IM) on social networks is one of the most active areas of research in computer science. While various IM techniques proposed over the last decade have definitely enriched the field, unfortunately, experimental reports on existing techniques fall short in validity and integrity since many comparisons are not based on a common platform or merely discussed in theory. In this paper, we perform an in-depth benchmarking study of IM techniques on social networks. Specifically, we design a benchmarking platform, which enables us to evaluate and compare the existing techniques systematically and thoroughly under identical experimental conditions. Our benchmarking results analyze and diagnose the inherent deficiencies of the existing approaches and surface the open challenges in IM even after a decade of research. More fundamentally, we unearth and debunk a series of myths and establish that there is no single state-of-the-art technique in IM. At best, a technique is the state of the art in only one aspect."

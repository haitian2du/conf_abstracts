Interactive Mapping Specification with Exemplar Tuples,"While schema mapping specification is a cumbersome task for data curation specialists, it becomes unfeasible for non-expert users, who are unacquainted with the semantics and languages of the involved transformations."
Foofah: Transforming Data By Example,"Data transformation is a critical first step in modern data analysis: before any analysis can be done, data from a variety of sources must be wrangled into a uniform format that is amenable to the intended analysis and analytical software package. This data transformation task is tedious, time-consuming, and often requires programming skills beyond the expertise of data analysts. In this paper, we develop a technique to synthesize data transformation programs by example, reducing this burden by allowing the analyst to describe the transformation with a small input-output example pair, without being concerned with the transformation steps required to get there. We implemented our technique in a system, FOOFAH, that efficiently searches the space of possible data transformation operations to generate a program that will perform the desired transformation. We experimentally show that data transformation programs can be created quickly with FOOFAH for a wide variety of cases, with 60% less user effort than the well-known WRANGLER system."
QIRANA: A Framework for Scalable Query Pricing,"Users are increasingly engaging in buying and selling data over the web. Facilitated by the proliferation of online marketplaces that bring such users together, data brokers need to serve requests where they provide results for user queries over the underlying datasets, and price them fairly according to the information disclosed by the query. In this work, we present a novel pricing system, called QIRANA, that performs query-based data pricing for a large class of SQL queries (including aggregation) in real time. QIRANA provides prices with formal guarantees: for example, it avoids prices that create arbitrage opportunities. Our framework also allows flexible pricing, by allowing the data seller to choose from a variety of pricing functions, as well as specify relation and attribute-level parameters that control the price of queries and assign different value to different portions of the data. We test QIRANA on a variety of real-world datasets and query workloads, and we show that it can efficiently compute the prices for queries over large-scale data."

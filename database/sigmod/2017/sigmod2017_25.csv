Utility-Aware Ridesharing on Road Networks,"Ridesharing enables drivers to share any empty seats in their vehicles with riders to improve the efficiency of transportation for the benefit of both drivers and riders. Different from existing studies in ridesharing that focus on minimizing the travel costs of vehicles, we consider that the satisfaction of riders (the utility values) is more important nowadays. Thus, we formulate the problem of utility-aware ridesharing on road networks (URR) with the goal of providing the optimal rider schedules for vehicles to maximize the overall utility, subject to spatial-temporal and capacity constraints. To assign a new rider to a given vehicle, we propose an efficient algorithm with a minimum increase in travel cost without reordering the existing schedule of the vehicle. We prove that the URR problem is NP-hard by reducing it from the 0-1 Knapsack problem and it is unlikely to be approximated within any constant factor in polynomial time through a reduction from the DENS k-SUBGRAPH problem. Therefore, we propose three efficient approximate algorithms, including a bilateral arrangement algorithm, an efficient greedy algorithm and a grouping-based scheduling algorithm, to assign riders to suitable vehicles with a high overall utility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our URR approaches on both real and synthetic data sets."
Distance Oracle on Terrain Surface,"Due to the advance of the geo-spatial positioning and the computer graphics technology, digital terrain data become more and more popular nowadays. Query processing on terrain data has attracted considerable attention from both the academic community and the industry community. One fundamental and important query is the shortest distance query and many other applications such as proximity queries (including nearest neighbor queries and range queries), 3D object feature vector construction and 3D object data mining are built based on the result of the shortest distance query. In this paper, we study the shortest distance query which is to find the shortest distance between a point-of-interest and another point-of-interest on the surface of the terrain due to a variety of applications. As observed by existing studies, computing the exact shortest distance is very expensive. Some existing studies proposed ε-approximate distance oracles where ε is a non-negative real number and is an error parameter. However, the best-known algorithm has a large oracle construction time, a large oracle size and a large distance query time. Motivated by this, we propose a novel ε-approximate distance oracle called the Space Efficient distance oracle (SE) which has a small oracle construction time, a small oracle size and a small distance query time due to its compactness storing concise information about pairwise distances between any two points-of-interest. Our experimental results show that the oracle construction time, the oracle size and the distance query time of SE are up to two orders of magnitude, up to 3 orders of magnitude and up to 5 orders of magnitude faster than the best-known algorithm."
Efficient Computation of Top-k Frequent Terms over Spatio-temporal Ranges,"The wide availability of tracking devices has drastically increased the role of geolocation in social networks, resulting in new commercial applications; for example, marketers can identify current trending topics within a region of interest and focus their products accordingly. In this paper we study a basic analytics query on geotagged data, namely: given a spatiotemporal region, find the most frequent terms among the social posts in that region. While there has been prior work on keyword search on spatial data (find the objects nearest to the query point that contain the query keywords), and on group keyword search on spatial data (retrieving groups of objects), our problem is different in that it returns keywords and aggregated frequencies as output, instead of having the keyword as input. Moreover, we differ from works addressing the streamed version of this query in that we operate on large, disk resident data and we provide exact answers. We propose an index structure and algorithms to efficiently answer such top-k spatiotemporal range queries, which we refer as Top-k Frequent Spatiotemporal Terms (kFST) queries. Our index structure employs an R-tree augmented by top-k sorted term lists (STLs), where a key challenge is to balance the size of the index to achieve faster execution and smaller space requirements. We theoretically study and experimentally validate the ideal length of the stored term lists, and perform detailed experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to baselines on real datasets."

Approximate Query Processing: No Silver Bullet,"In this paper, we reflect on the state of the art of Approximate Query Processing. Although much technical progress has been made in this area of research, we are yet to see its impact on products and services. We discuss two promising avenues to pursue towards integrating Approximate Query Processing into data platforms."
Approximate Query Engines: Commercial Challenges and Research Opportunities,"Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in Approximate Query Processing (AQP) solutions, both in academia and the commercial world. In addition to well-known open problems in this area, there are many new research challenges that have surfaced as a result of the first interaction of AQP technology with commercial and real-world customers. We categorize these into deployment, planning, and interface challenges. At the same time, AQP settings introduce many interesting opportunities that would not be possible in a database with precise answers. These opportunities create hopes for overcoming some of the major limitations of traditional database systems. For example, we discuss how a database can reuse its past work in a generic way, and become smarter as it answers new queries. Our goal in this talk is to suggest some of the exciting research directions in this field that are worth pursuing."
Approximate Query Processing for Interactive Data Science,"shift in the algorithms and tools used to analyze data towards more interactive systems with highly collaborative and visual interfaces. Ideally, a data scientist and a domain expert should be able to make discoveries together by directly manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data on the spot, for example, using an interactive whiteboard like the recently released Microsoft Surface Hub."

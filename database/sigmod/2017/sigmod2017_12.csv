Controlling False Discoveries During Interactive Data Exploration,"Recent tools for interactive data exploration significantly increase the chance that users make false discoveries. They allow users to (visually) examine many hypotheses and make inference with simple interactions, and thus incur the issue commonly known in statistics as the ""multiple hypothesis testing error."" In this work, we propose a solution to integrate the control of multiple hypothesis testing into interactive data exploration systems. A key insight is that existing methods for controlling the false discovery rate (such as FDR) are not directly applicable to interactive data exploration. We therefore discuss a set of new control procedures that are better suited for this task and integrate them in our system, QUDE. Via extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data sets we demonstrate how QUDE can help experts and novice users alike to efficiently control false discoveries."
MacroBase: Prioritizing Attention in Fast Data,"As data volumes continue to rise, manual inspection is becoming increasingly untenable. In response, we present MacroBase, a data analytics engine that prioritizes end-user attention in high-volume fast data streams. MacroBase enables efficient, accurate, and modular analyses that highlight and aggregate important and unusual behavior, acting as a search engine for fast data. MacroBase is able to deliver order-of-magnitude speedups over alternatives by optimizing the combination of explanation and classification tasks and by leveraging a new reservoir sampler and heavy-hitters sketch specialized for fast data streams. As a result, MacroBase delivers accurate results at speeds of up to 2M events per second per query on a single core. The system has delivered meaningful results in production, including at a telematics company monitoring hundreds of thousands of vehicles."
Data Canopy: Accelerating Exploratory Statistical Analysis,"During exploratory statistical analysis, data scientists repeatedly compute statistics on data sets to infer knowledge. Moreover, statistics form the building blocks of core machine learning classification and filtering algorithms. Modern data systems, software libraries, and domain-specific tools provide support to compute statistics but lack a cohesive framework for storing, organizing, and reusing them. This creates a significant problem for exploratory statistical analysis as data grows: Despite existing overlap in exploratory workloads (which are repetitive in nature), statistics are always computed from scratch. This leads to repeated data movement and recomputation, hindering interactive data exploration."

Landmark Indexing for Evaluation of Label-Constrained Reachability Queries,"Consider a directed edge-labeled graph, such as a social network or a citation network. A fundamental query on such data is to determine if there is a path in the graph from a given source vertex to a given target vertex, using only edges with labels in a restricted subset of the edge labels in the graph. Such label-constrained reachability (LCR) queries play an important role in graph analytics, for example, as a core fragment of the so-called regular path queries which are supported in practical graph query languages such as the W3C's SPARQL 1.1, Neo4j's Cypher, and Oracle's PGQL. Current solutions for LCR evaluation, however, do not scale to large graphs which are increasingly common in a broad range of application domains. In this paper we present the first practical solution for efficient LCR evaluation, leveraging landmark-based indexes for large graphs. We show through extensive experiments that our indexes are significantly smaller than state-of-the-art LCR indexing techniques, while supporting up to orders of magnitude faster query evaluation times. Our complete C++ codebase is available as open source for further research."
Efficient Ad-Hoc Graph Inference and Matching in Biological Databases,"In many real applications such as bioinformatics and biological network analysis, it has always been an important, yet challenging, topic to accurately infer/reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from microarray data, and efficiently identify those matching GRNs with similar interaction structures for potential disease analysis and treatment tasks. Motivated by this, in this paper, we formalize the problem of ad-hoc inference and matching over gene regulatory networks (IM-GRN), which deciphers ad-hoc GRN graph structures online from gene feature databases (without full GRN materializations), and retrieves the inferred GRNs that are subgraph-isomorphic to a query GRN graph with high confidences. Specifically, we propose a novel probabilistic score to measure the possible interaction between any two genes (inferred from gene feature vectors), and thus model GRNs by probabilistic graphs, containing edge existence probabilities. In order to efficiently process IM-GRN queries, we propose effective reduction, pruning, and embedding strategies to significantly reduce the search space of GRN inference and matching, without materializing all GRNs. We also present an effective indexing mechanism and an efficient IM-GRN query processing algorithm by the index traversal. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed IM-GRN query answering approaches over real/synthetic GRN data sets."
DAG Reduction: Fast Answering Reachability Queries,"Answering reachability queries is one of the fundamental graph operations. The existing approaches build indexes and answer reachability queries on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G, which is constructed by coalescing each strongly connected component of the given directed graph G into a node of G. Considering that G can still be large to be processed efficiently, there are studies to further reduce G to a smaller graph. However, these approaches suffer from either inefficiency in answering reachability queries, or cannot scale to large graphs."
Flexible and Feasible Support Measures for Mining Frequent Patterns in Large Labeled Graphs,"In recent years, the popularity of graph databases has grown rapidly. This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph setting, there are two main problems: support measure and search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing support measures that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based support measures. Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs. Based on that, we present two new support measures: minimum instance (MI) measure and minimum vertex cover (MVC) measure, that combine the advantages of existing measures. In particular, we show that the existing minimum-image-based support measure is an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time computable and results in counts that are close to number of instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NP-hard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. We also provide polynomial-time relaxations for both measures and bounding theorems for all presented support measures in the hypergraph setting. We further show that the hypergraph-based framework can unify all support measures studied in this paper. This framework is also flexible in that more variants of support measures can be defined and profiled in it."

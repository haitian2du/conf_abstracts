Determining the Impact Regions of Competing Options in Preference Space,"In rank-aware processing, user preferences are typically represented by a numeric weight per data attribute, collectively forming a weight vector. The score of an option (data record) is defined as the weighted sum of its individual attributes. The highest-scoring options across a set of alternatives (dataset) are shortlisted for the user as the recommended ones. In that setting, the user input is a vector (equivalently, a point) in a d-dimensional preference space, where d is the number of data attributes. In this paper we study the problem of determining in which regions of the preference space the weight vector should lie so that a given option (focal record) is among the top-k score-wise. In effect, these regions capture all possible user profiles for which the focal record is highly preferable, and are therefore essential in market impact analysis, potential customer identification, profile-based marketing, targeted advertising, etc. We refer to our problem as k-Shortlist Preference Region identification (kSPR), and exploit its computational geometric nature to develop a framework for its efficient (and exact) processing. Using real and synthetic benchmarks, we show that our most optimized algorithm outperforms by three orders of magnitude a competitor we constructed from previous work on a different problem."
Efficient Computation of Regret-ratio Minimizing Set: A Compact Maxima Representative,"Finding the maxima of a database based on a user preference, especially when the ranking function is a linear combination of the attributes, has been the subject of recent research. A critical observation is that the em convex hull is the subset of tuples that can be used to find the maxima of any linear function. However, in real world applications the convex hull can be a significant portion of the database, and thus its performance is greatly reduced. Thus, computing a subset limited to $r$ tuples that minimizes the regret ratio (a measure of the user's dissatisfaction with the result from the limited set versus the one from the entire database) is of interest."
FEXIPRO: Fast and Exact Inner Product Retrieval in Recommender Systems,"Recommender systems have many successful applications in e-commerce and social media, including Amazon, Netflix, and Yelp. Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of the most popular recommendation approaches; the original user-product rating matrix R with millions of rows and columns is decomposed into a user matrix Q and an item matrix P, such that the product QT P approximates R. Each column q (p) of Q (P) holds the latent factors of the corresponding user (item), and qT p is a prediction of the rating to item p by user q. Recommender systems based on MF suggest to a user in q the items with the top-k scores in qT P. For this problem, we propose a Fast and EXact Inner PROduct retrieval (FEXIPRO) framework, based on sequential scan, which includes three elements. First, FEXIPRO applies an SVD transformation to P, after which the first several dimensions capture a large percentage of the inner products. This enables us to prune item vectors by only computing their partial inner products with q. Second, we construct an integer approximation version of P, which can be used to compute fast upper bounds for the inner products that can prune item vectors. Finally, we apply a lossless transformation to P, such that the resulting matrix has only positive values, allowing for the inner products to be monotonically increasing with dimensionality. Experiments on real data demonstrate that our framework outperforms alternative approaches typically by an order of magnitude."
Feedback-Aware Social Event-Participant Arrangement,"Online event-based social networks (EBSNs) and studies on global event-participant arrangement strategies for EBSNs are becoming popular recently. Existing works measure satisfaction of an arrangement by a linear combination of few factors, weights of which are predefined and fixed, and do not allow users to provide feedbacks on whether accepting the arrangement or not. Besides, most of them only consider offline scenarios, where full information of users is known in advance. However, on real-world EBSN platforms, users can dynamically log in the platform and register for events on a first come, first served basis. In other words, online scenarios of event-participant arrangement strategies should be considered. In this work, we study a new event-participant arrangement strategy for online scenarios, the Feedback-Aware Social Event-participant Arrangement (FASEA) problem, where satisfaction scores of an arrangement are learned adaptively and users can choose to accept or reject the arranged events. Particularly, we model the problem as a contextual combinatorial bandit setting and use efficient and effective algorithms to solve the problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of the solutions are evaluated with extensive experimental studies and our findings indicate that the state-of-the-art Thompson Sampling that is reported to work well under basic multi-armed bandit does not perform well under FASEA."

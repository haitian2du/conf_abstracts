Top-k Relevant Semantic Place Retrieval on Spatial RDF Data,"RDF data are traditionally accessed using structured query languages, such as SPARQL. However, this requires users to understand the language as well as the RDF schema. Keyword search on RDF data aims at relieving the user from these requirements; the user only inputs a set of keywords and the goal is to find small RDF subgraphs which contain all keywords. At the same time, popular RDF knowledge bases also include spatial semantics, which opens the road to location-based search operations. In this work, we propose and study a novel location-based keyword search query on RDF data. The objective of top-k relevant semantic places (kSP) retrieval is to find RDF subgraphs which contain the query keywords and are rooted at spatial entities close to the query location. The novelty of kSP queries is that they are location-aware and that they do not rely on the use of structured query languages. We design a basic method for the processing of kSP queries. To further accelerate kSP retrieval, two pruning approaches and a data preprocessing technique are proposed. Extensive empirical studies on two real datasets demonstrate the superior and robust performance of our proposals compared to the basic method."
Local Similarity Search for Unstructured Text,"With the growing popularity of electronic documents, replication can occur for many reasons. People may copy text segments from various sources and make modifications. In this paper, we study the problem of local similarity search to find partially replicated text. Unlike existing studies on similarity search which find entirely duplicated documents, our target is to identify documents that approximately share a pair of sliding windows which differ by no more than Ï„ tokens. Our problem is technically challenging because for sliding windows the tokens to be indexed are less selective than entire documents, rendering set similarity join-based algorithms less efficient. Our proposed method is based on enumerating token combinations to obtain signatures with high selectivity. In order to strike a balance between signature and candidate generation, we partition the token universe and for different partitions we generate combinations composed of different numbers of tokens. A cost-aware algorithm is devised to find a good partitioning of the token universe. We also propose to leverage the overlap between adjacent windows to share computation and thus speed up query processing. In addition, we develop the techniques to support the large thresholds. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our method against alternative solutions."
Similarity Join over Array Data,"Scientific applications are generating an ever-increasing volume of multi-dimensional data that are largely processed inside distributed array databases and frameworks. Similarity join is a fundamental operation across scientific workloads that requires complex processing over an unbounded number of pairs of multi-dimensional points. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed similarity join operator for multi-dimensional arrays. Unlike immediate extensions to array join and relational similarity join, the proposed operator minimizes the overall data transfer and network congestion while providing load-balancing, without completely repartitioning and replicating the input arrays. We define formally array similarity join and present the design, optimization strategies, and evaluation of the first array similarity join operator."
LazyLSH: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for Multiple Distance Functions with a Single Index,"Due to the ""curse of dimensionality"" problem, it is very expensive to process the nearest neighbor (NN) query in high-dimensional spaces; and hence, approximate approaches, such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), are widely used for their theoretical guarantees and empirical performance. Current LSH-based approaches target at the L1 and L2 spaces, while as shown in previous work, the fractional distance metrics (Lp metrics with 0 < p < 1) can provide more insightful results than the usual L1 and L2 metrics for data mining and multimedia applications. However, none of the existing work can support multiple fractional distance metrics using one index. In this paper, we propose LazyLSH that answers approximate nearest neighbor queries for multiple Lp metrics with theoretical guarantees. Different from previous LSH approaches which need to build one dedicated index for every query space, LazyLSH uses a single base index to support the computations in multiple Lp spaces, significantly reducing the maintenance overhead. Extensive experiments show that LazyLSH provides more accurate results for approximate kNN search under fractional distance metrics."
Set-based Similarity Search for Time Series,"A fundamental problem of time series is k nearest neighbor (k-NN) query processing. However, existing methods are not fast enough for large dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, STS3, to process k-NN queries by transforming time series to sets and measure the similarity under Jaccard metric. Our approach is more accurate than Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) in our suitable scenarios and it is faster than most of the existing methods, due to the efficient similarity search for sets. Besides, we also developed an index, a pruning and an approximation technique to improve the k-NN query procedure. As shown in the experimental results, all of them could accelerate the query processing effectively."
Range-based Obstructed Nearest Neighbor Queries,"In this paper, we study a novel variant of obstructed nearest neighbor queries, namely, range-based obstructed nearest neighbor (RONN) search. A natural generalization of continuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN), an RONN query retrieves the obstructed nearest neighbor for every point in a specified range. To process RONN, we first propose a CONN-Based (CONNB) algorithm as our baseline, which reduces the RONN query into a range query and four CONN queries processed using an R-tree. To address the shortcomings of the CONNB algorithm, we then propose a new RONN by R-tree Filtering (RONN-RF) algorithm, which explores effective filtering, also using R-tree. Next, we propose a new index, called O-tree, dedicated for indexing objects in the obstructed space. The novelty of O-tree lies in the idea of dividing the obstructed space into non-obstructed subspaces, aiming to efficiently retrieve highly qualified candidates for RONN processing. We develop an O-tree construction algorithm and propose a space division scheme, called optimal obstacle balance (OOB) scheme, to address the tree balance problem. Accordingly, we propose an efficient algorithm, called RONN by O-tree Acceleration (RONN-OA), which exploits O-tree to accelerate query processing of RONN. In addition, we extend O-tree for indexing polygons. At last, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation using both real and synthetic datasets to validate our ideas and the proposed algorithms. The experimental result shows that the RONN-OA algorithm outperforms the two R-tree based algorithms significantly. Moreover, we show that the OOB scheme achieves the best tree balance in O-tree and outperforms two baseline schemes."

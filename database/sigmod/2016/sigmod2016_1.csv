Learning Linear Regression Models over Factorized Joins,"We investigate the problem of building least squares regression models over training datasets defined by arbitrary join queries on database tables. Our key observation is that joins entail a high degree of redundancy in both computation and data representation, which is not required for the end-to-end solution to learning over joins."
To Join or Not to Join?: Thinking Twice about Joins before Feature Selection,"Closer integration of machine learning (ML) with data processing is a booming area in both the data management industry and academia. Almost all ML toolkits assume that the input is a single table, but many datasets are not stored as single tables due to normalization. Thus, analysts often perform key-foreign key joins to obtain features from all base tables and apply a feature selection method, either explicitly or implicitly, with the aim of improving accuracy. In this work, we show that the features brought in by such joins can often be ignored without affecting ML accuracy significantly, i.e., we can ""avoid joins safely."" We identify the core technical issue that could cause accuracy to decrease in some cases and analyze this issue theoretically. Using simulations, we validate our analysis and measure the effects of various properties of normalized data on accuracy. We apply our analysis to design easy-to-understand decision rules to predict when it is safe to avoid joins in order to help analysts exploit this runtime-accuracy trade-off. Experiments with multiple real normalized datasets show that our rules are able to accurately predict when joins can be avoided safely, and in some cases, this led to significant reductions in the runtime of some popular feature selection methods."
Real-time Video Recommendation Exploration,"Video recommendation has attracted growing attention in recent years. However, conventional techniques have limitations in real-time processing, accuracy or scalability for the large-scale video data. To address the deficiencies of current recommendation systems, we introduce some new techniques to provide real-time and accurate recommendations to users in the video recommendation system of Tencent Inc.. We develop a scalable online collaborative filtering algorithm based upon matrix factorization, with an adjustable updating strategy considering implicit feedback solution of different user actions. To select high-quality candidate videos for real-time top-N recommendation generation, we utilize additional factors like video type and time factor to compute similar videos. In addition, we propose the scalable implementation of our algorithm together with some optimizations to make the recommendations more efficient and accurate, including the demographic filtering and demographic training. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model, we conduct comprehensive experiments by collecting real data from Tencent Video. Furthermore, our video recommendation system is in production to provide recommendation services in Tencent Video, one of the largest video sites in China, and verifies its superiority in performance."
Towards Globally Optimal Crowdsourcing Quality Management: The Uniform Worker Setting,"We study crowdsourcing quality management, that is, given worker responses to a set of tasks, our goal is to jointly estimate the true answers for the tasks, as well as the quality of the workers. Prior work on this problem relies primarily on applying Expectation-Maximization (EM) on the underlying maximum likelihood problem to estimate true answers as well as worker quality. Unfortunately, EM only provides a locally optimal solution rather than a globally optimal one. Other solutions to the problem (that do not leverage EM) fail to provide global optimality guarantees as well. In this paper, we focus on filtering, where tasks require the evaluation of a yes/no predicate, and rating, where tasks elicit integer scores from a finite domain. We design algorithms for finding the global optimal estimates of correct task answers and worker quality for the underlying maximum likelihood problem, and characterize the complexity of these algorithms. Our algorithms conceptually consider all mappings from tasks to true answers (typically a very large number), leveraging two key ideas to reduce, by several orders of magnitude, the number of mappings under consideration, while preserving optimality. We also demonstrate that these algorithms often find more accurate estimates than EM-based algorithms. This paper makes an important contribution towards understanding the inherent complexity of globally optimal crowdsourcing quality management."
Building the Enterprise Fabric for Big Data with Vertica and Spark Integration,"Enterprise customers increasingly require greater flexibility in the way they access and process their Big Data while at the same time they continue to request advanced analytics and access to diverse data sources. Yet customers also still require the robustness of enterprise class analytics for their mission-critical data. In this paper, we present our initial efforts toward a solution that satisfies the above requirements by integrating the HPE Vertica enterprise database with Apache Spark's open source big data computation engine. In particular, it enables fast, reliable transferring of data between Vertica and Spark; and deploying Machine Learning models created by Spark into Vertica for predictive analytics on Vertica data. This integration provides a fabric on which our customers get the best of both worlds: it extends Vertica's extensive SQL analytics capabilities with Spark's machine learning library (MLlib), giving Vertica users access to a wide range of ML functions; it also enables customers to leverage Spark as an advanced ETL engine for all data that require the guarantees offered by Vertica."
Truss Decomposition of Probabilistic Graphs: Semantics and Algorithms,"A key operation in network analysis is the discovery of cohesive subgraphs. The notion of $k$-truss has gained considerable popularity in this regard, based on its rich structure and efficient computability. However, many complex networks such as social, biological and communication networks feature uncertainty, best modeled using probabilities. Unfortunately the problem of discovering k-trusses in probabilistic graphs has received little attention to date. In this paper, given a probabilistic graph G, number k and parameter γ --(0,1], we define a (k,γ)-truss as a maximal connected subgraph H ⊆ G, in which for each edge, the probability that it is contained in at least (k-2) triangles is at least γ. We develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for decomposing a probabilistic graph into such maximal (k,γ)-trusses. The above definition of a (k,γ)-truss is local in that the ""witness"" graphs that has the (k-2) triangles containing an edge in H may be quite different for distinct edges. Hence, we also propose: a global (k,γ)-truss, which in addition to being a local (k,γ)-truss, has to satisfy the condition that the probability that H contains a k-truss is at least γ. We show that unlike local (k,γ)-trusses, the global (k,γ)-truss decomposition on a probabilistic graph is intractable. We propose a novel sampling technique which enables approximate discovery of global (k,γ)-trusses with high probability. Our extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach and the usefulness of local and global (k,γ)-truss."
Efficient and Progressive Group Steiner Tree Search,"The Group Steiner Tree (GST) problem is a fundamental problem in database area that has been successfully applied to keyword search in relational databases and team search in social networks. The state-of-the-art algorithm for the GST problem is a parameterized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which finds the optimal tree in O(3kn+2k(n log n + m)) time, where k is the number of given groups, m and n are the number of the edges and nodes of the graph respectively. The major limitations of the parameterized DP algorithm are twofold: (i) it is intractable even for very small values of k (e.g., k=8) in large graphs due to its exponential complexity, and (ii) it cannot generate a solution until the algorithm has completed its entire execution. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient and progressive GST algorithm in this paper, called PrunedDP. It is based on newly-developed optimal-tree decomposition and conditional tree merging techniques. The proposed algorithm not only drastically reduces the search space of the parameterized DP algorithm, but it also produces progressively-refined feasible solutions during algorithm execution. To further speed up the PrunedDP algorithm, we propose a progressive A*-search algorithm, based on several carefully-designed lower-bounding techniques. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our algorithms on several large scale real-world graphs. The results show that our best algorithm is not only able to generate progressively-refined feasible solutions, but it also finds the optimal solution with at least two orders of magnitude acceleration over the state-of-the-art algorithm, using much less memory."

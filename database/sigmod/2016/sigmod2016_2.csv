Publishing Attributed Social Graphs with Formal Privacy Guarantees,"Many data analysis tasks rely on the abstraction of a graph to represent relations between entities, with attributes on the nodes and edges. Since the relationships encoded are often sensitive, we seek effective ways to release representative graphs which nevertheless protect the privacy of the data subjects. Prior work on this topic has focused primarily on the graph structure in isolation, and has not provided ways to handle richer graphs with correlated attributes."
Publishing Graph Degree Distribution with Node Differential Privacy,"Graph data publishing under node-differential privacy (node-DP) is challenging due to the huge sensitivity of queries. However, since a node in graph data oftentimes represents a person, node-DP is necessary to achieve personal data protection. In this paper, we investigate the problem of publishing the degree distribution of a graph under node-DP by exploring the projection approach to reduce the sensitivity. We propose two approaches based on aggregation and cumulative histogram to publish the degree distribution. The experiments demonstrate that our approaches greatly reduce the error of approximating the true degree distribution and have significant improvement over existing works. We also present the introspective analysis for understanding the factors of publishing the degree distribution with node-DP."
Principled Evaluation of Differentially Private Algorithms using DPBench,"Differential privacy has become the dominant standard in the research community for strong privacy protection. There has been a flood of research into query answering algorithms that meet this standard. Algorithms are becoming increasingly complex, and in particular, the performance of many emerging algorithms is data dependent, meaning the distribution of the noise added to query answers may change depending on the input data. Theoretical analysis typically only considers the worst case, making empirical study of average case performance increasingly important. In this paper we propose a set of evaluation principles which we argue are essential for sound evaluation. Based on these principles we propose DPBench, a novel evaluation framework for standardized evaluation of privacy algorithms. We then apply our benchmark to evaluate algorithms for answering 1- and 2-dimensional range queries. The result is a thorough empirical study of 15 published algorithms on a total of 27 datasets that offers new insights into algorithm behavior---in particular the influence of dataset scale and shape---and a more complete characterization of the state of the art. Our methodology is able to resolve inconsistencies in prior empirical studies and place algorithm performance in context through comparison to simple baselines. Finally, we pose open research questions which we hope will guide future algorithm design."
PrivTree: A Differentially Private Algorithm for Hierarchical Decompositions,"Given a set D of tuples defined on a domain Omega, we study differentially private algorithms for constructing a histogram over Omega to approximate the tuple distribution in D. Existing solutions for the problem mostly adopt a hierarchical decomposition approach, which recursively splits Omega into sub-domains and computes a noisy tuple count for each sub-domain, until all noisy counts are below a certain threshold. This approach, however, requires that we (i) impose a limit h on the recursion depth in the splitting of Omega and (ii) set the noise in each count to be proportional to h. The choice of h is a serious dilemma: a small h makes the resulting histogram too coarse-grained, while a large h leads to excessive noise in the tuple counts used in deciding whether sub-domains should be split. Furthermore, h cannot be directly tuned based on D; otherwise, the choice of h itself reveals private information and violates differential privacy. To remedy the deficiency of existing solutions, we present PrivTree, a histogram construction algorithm that adopts hierarchical decomposition but completely eliminates the dependency on a pre-defined h. The core of PrivTree is a novel mechanism that (i) exploits a new analysis on the Laplace distribution and (ii) enables us to use only a constant amount of noise in deciding whether a sub-domain should be split, without worrying about the recursion depth of splitting. We demonstrate the application of PrivTree in modelling spatial data, and show that it can be extended to handle sequence data (where the decision in sub-domain splitting is not based on tuple counts but a more sophisticated measure). Our experiments on a variety of real datasets show that PrivTree considerably outperforms the states of the art in terms of data utility."
Adaptive Indexing over Encrypted Numeric Data,"Today, outsourcing query processing tasks to remote cloud servers becomes a viable option; such outsourcing calls for encrypting data stored at the server so as to render it secure against eavesdropping adversaries and/or an honest-but-curious server itself. At the same time, to be efficiently managed, outsourced data should be indexed, and even adaptively so, as a side-effect of query processing. Computationally heavy encryption schemes render such outsourcing unattractive; an alternative, Order-Preserving Encryption Scheme (OPES), intentionally preserves and reveals the order in the data, hence is unattractive from the security viewpoint. In this paper, we propose and analyze a scheme for lightweight and indexable encryption, based on linear-algebra operations. Our scheme provides higher security than OPES and allows for range and point queries to be efficiently evaluated over encrypted numeric data, with decryption performed at the client side. We implement a prototype that performs incremental, query-triggered adaptive indexing over encrypted numeric data based on this scheme, without leaking order information in advance, and without prohibitive overhead, as our extensive experimental study demonstrates."
Practical Private Range Search Revisited,"We consider a data owner that outsources its dataset to an untrusted server. The owner wishes to enable the server to answer range queries on a single attribute, without compromising the privacy of the data and the queries. There are several schemes on ""practical"" private range search (mainly in Databases venues) that attempt to strike a trade-off between efficiency and security. Nevertheless, these methods either lack provable security guarantees, or permit unacceptable privacy leakages. In this paper, we take an interdisciplinary approach, which combines the rigor of Security formulations and proofs with efficient Data Management techniques. We construct a wide set of novel schemes with realistic security/performance trade-offs, adopting the notion of Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) primarily proposed for keyword search. We reduce range search to multi-keyword search using range covering techniques with tree-like indexes. We demonstrate that, given any secure SSE scheme, the challenge boils down to (i) formulating leakages that arise from the index structure, and (ii) minimizing false positives incurred by some schemes under heavy data skew. We analytically detail the superiority of our proposals over prior work and experimentally confirm their practicality."
Privacy Preserving Subgraph Matching on Large Graphs in Cloud,"The wide presence of large graph data and the increasing popularity of storing data in the cloud drive the needs for graph query processing on a remote cloud. But a fundamental challenge is to process user queries without compromising sensitive information. This work focuses on privacy preserving subgraph matching in a cloud server. The goal is to minimize the overhead on both cloud and client sides for subgraph matching, without compromising users' sensitive information. To that end, we transform an original graph $G$ into a privacy preserving graph Gk, which meets the requirement of an existing privacy model known as k-automorphism. By making use of the symmetry in a k-automorphic graph, a subgraph matching query can be efficiently answered using a graph Go, a small subset of Gk. This approach saves both space and query cost in the cloud server. We also anonymize the query graphs to protect their label information using label generalization technique. To reduce the search space for a subgraph matching query, we propose a cost model to select the more effective label combinations. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are demonstrated through extensive experimental results on real datasets."

Time Adaptive Sketches (Ada-Sketches) for Summarizing Data Streams,"Obtaining frequency information of data streams, in limited space, is a well-recognized problem in literature. A number of recent practical applications (such as those in computational advertising) require temporally-aware solutions: obtaining historical count statistics for both time-points as well as time-ranges. In these scenarios, accuracy of estimates is typically more important for recent instances than for older ones; we call this desirable property Time Adaptiveness. With this observation, [20] introduced the Hokusai technique based on count-min sketches for estimating the frequency of any given item at any given time. The proposed approach is problematic in practice, as its memory requirements grow linearly with time, and it produces discontinuities in the estimation accuracy. In this work, we describe a new method, Time-adaptive Sketches, (Ada-sketch), that overcomes these limitations, while extending and providing a strict generalization of several popular sketching algorithms. The core idea of our method is inspired by the well-known digital Dolby noise reduction procedure that dates back to the 1960s. The theoretical analysis presented could be of independent interest in itself, as it provides clear results for the time-adaptive nature of the errors. An experimental evaluation on real streaming datasets demonstrates the superiority of the described method over Hokusai in estimating point and range queries over time. The method is simple to implement and offers a variety of design choices for future extensions. The simplicity of the procedure and the method's generalization of classic sketching techniques give hope for wide applicability of Ada-sketches in practice."
Streaming Algorithms for Robust Distinct Elements,"We study the problem of estimating distinct elements in the data stream model, which has a central role in traffic monitoring, query optimization, data mining and data integration. Different from all previous work, we study the problem in the noisy data setting, where two different looking items in the stream may reference the same entity (determined by a distance function and a threshold value), and the goal is to estimate the number of distinct entities in the stream. In this paper, we formalize the problem of robust distinct elements, and develop space and time-efficient streaming algorithms for datasets in the Euclidean space, using a novel technique we call bucket sampling. We also extend our algorithmic framework to other metric spaces by establishing a connection between bucket sampling and the theory of locality sensitive hashing. Moreover, we formally prove that our algorithms are still effective under small distinct elements ambiguity. Our experiments demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms."
Augmented Sketch: Faster and More Accurate Stream Processing,"Approximated algorithms are often used to estimate the frequency of items on high volume, fast data streams. The most common ones are variations of Count-Min sketch, which use sub-linear space for the count, but can produce errors in the counts of the most frequent items and can misclassify low-frequency items. In this paper, we improve the accuracy of sketch-based algorithms by increasing the frequency estimation accuracy of the most frequent items and reducing the possible misclassification of low-frequency items, while also improving the overall throughput. Our solution, called Augmented Sketch (ASketch), is based on a pre-filtering stage that dynamically identifies and aggregates the most frequent items. Items overflowing the pre-filtering stage are processed using a conventional sketch algorithm, thereby making the solution general and applicable in a wide range of contexts. The pre-filtering stage can be efficiently implemented with SIMD instructions on multi-core machines and can be further parallelized through pipeline parallelism where the filtering stage runs in one core and the sketch algorithm runs in another core."
Matrix Sketching Over Sliding Windows,"Large-scale matrix computation becomes essential for many data data applications, and hence the problem of sketching matrix with small space and high precision has received extensive study for the past few years. This problem is often considered in the row-update streaming model, where the data set is a matrix A -- Rn x d, and the processor receives a row (1 x d) of A at each timestamp. The goal is to maintain a smaller matrix (termed approximation matrix, or simply approximation) B -- Rl x d as an approximation to A, such that the covariance error |AT A - BTB| is small and l ll n."
Graph Stream Summarization: From Big Bang to Big Crunch,"A graph stream, which refers to the graph with edges being updated sequentially in a form of a stream, has important applications in cyber security and social networks. Due to the sheer volume and highly dynamic nature of graph streams, the practical way of handling them is by summarization. Given a graph stream G, directed or undirected, the problem of graph stream summarization is to summarize G as SG with a much smaller (sublinear) space, linear construction time and constant maintenance cost for each edge update, such that SG allows many queries over G to be approximately conducted efficiently. The widely used practice of summarizing data streams is to treat each stream element independently by e.g., hash- or sample-based methods, without maintaining the connections (or relationships) between elements. Hence, existing methods can only solve ad-hoc problems, without supporting diversified and complicated analytics over graph streams. We present TCM, a novel generalized graph stream summary. Given an incoming edge, it summarizes both node and edge information in constant time. Consequently, the summary forms a graphical sketch where edges capture the connections inside elements, and nodes maintain relationships across elements. We discuss a wide range of supported queries and establish some error bounds. In addition, we experimentally show that TCM can effectively and efficiently support analytics over graph streams, which demonstrates its potential to start a new line of research and applications in graph stream management."
Scalable Approximate Query Tracking over Highly Distributed Data Streams,"The recently-proposed Geometric Monitoring (GM) method has provided a general tool for the distributed monitoring of arbitrary non-linear queries over streaming data observed by a collection of remote sites, with numerous practical applications. Unfortunately, GM-based techniques can suffer from serious scalability issues with increasing numbers of remote sites. In this paper, we propose novel techniques that effectively tackle the aforementioned scalability problems by exploiting a carefully designed sample of the remote sites for efficient approximate query tracking. Our novel sampling-based scheme utilizes a sample of cardinality proportional to âˆšN (compared to N for the original GM), where $N$ is the number of sites in the network, to perform the monitoring process. Our experimental evaluation over a variety of real-life data streams demonstrates that our sampling-based techniques can significantly reduce the communication cost during distributed monitoring with controllable, predefined accuracy guarantees."

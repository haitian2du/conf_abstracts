Stop-and-Stare: Optimal Sampling Algorithms for Viral Marketing in Billion-scale Networks,"Influence Maximization (IM), that seeks a small set of key users who spread the influence widely into the network, is a core problem in multiple domains. It finds applications in viral marketing, epidemic control, and assessing cascading failures within complex systems. Despite the huge amount of effort, IM in billion-scale networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and World Wide Web has not been satisfactorily solved. Even the state-of-the-art methods such as TIM+ and IMM may take days on those networks. In this paper, we propose SSA and D-SSA, two novel sampling frameworks for IM-based viral marketing problems. SSA and D-SSA are up to 1200 times faster than the SIGMOD'15 best method, IMM, while providing the same (1-1/e-Îµ) approximation guarantee. Underlying our frameworks is an innovative Stop-and-Stare strategy in which they stop at exponential check points to verify (stare) if there is adequate statistical evidence on the solution quality. Theoretically, we prove that SSA and D-SSA are the first approximation algorithms that use (asymptotically) minimum numbers of samples, meeting strict theoretical thresholds characterized for IM. The absolute superiority of SSA and D-SSA are confirmed through extensive experiments on real network data for IM and another topic-aware viral marketing problem, named TVM."
Spheres of Influence for More Effective Viral Marketing,"What is the set of nodes of a social network that, under a probabilistic contagion model, would get infected if a given node $s$ gets infected? We call this set the sphere of influence of s. Due to the stochastic nature of the contagion model we need to define a notion of ""expected"" or ""typical"" cascade: this is a set of nodes which is the closest to all the possible cascades starting from s. We thus formalize the Typical Cascade problem which requires, for a given source node s, to find the set of nodes minimizing the expected Jaccard distance to all the possible cascades from s. The expected cost of a typical cascade also provides us a measure of the stability of cascade propagation, i.e., how much random cascades from a source node s deviate from the ""typical"" cascade. In this sense source nodes with lower expected costs are more reliable."
Continuous Influence Maximization: What Discounts Should We Offer to Social Network Users?,"Imagine we are introducing a new product through a social network, where we know for each user in the network the purchase probability curve with respect to discount. Then, what discount should we offer to those social network users so that the adoption of the product is maximized in expectation under a predefined budget? Although influence maximization has been extensively explored, surprisingly, this appealing practical problem still cannot be answered by the existing influence maximization methods. In this paper, we tackle the problem systematically. We formulate the general continuous influence maximization problem, investigate the essential properties, and develop a general coordinate descent algorithm as well as the engineering techniques for practical implementation. Our investigation does not assume any specific influence model and thus is general and principled. At the same time, using the most popularly adopted independent influence model as a concrete example, we demonstrate that more efficient methods are feasible under specific influence models. Our extensive empirical study on four benchmark real world networks with synthesized purchase probability curves clearly illustrates that continuous influence maximization can improve influence spread significantly with very moderate extra running time comparing to the classical influence maximization methods."
Holistic Influence Maximization: Combining Scalability and Efficiency with Opinion-Aware Models,"The steady growth of graph data from social networks has resulted in wide-spread research in finding solutions to the influence maximization problem. In this paper, we propose a holistic solution to the influence maximization (IM) problem. (1) We introduce an opinion-cum-interaction (OI) model that closely mirrors the real-world scenarios. Under the OI model, we introduce a novel problem of Maximizing the Effective Opinion (MEO) of influenced users. We prove that the MEO problem is NP-hard and cannot be approximated within a constant ratio unless P=NP. (2) We propose a heuristic algorithm OSIM to efficiently solve the MEO problem. To better explain the OSIM heuristic, we first introduce EaSyIM - the opinion-oblivious version of OSIM, a scalable algorithm capable of running within practical compute times on commodity hardware. In addition to serving as a fundamental building block for OSIM, EaSyIM is capable of addressing the scalability aspect - memory consumption and running time, of the IM problem as well. Empirically, our algorithms are capable of maintaining the deviation in the spread always within 5% of the best known methods in the literature. In addition, our experiments show that both OSIM and EaSyIM are effective, efficient, scalable and significantly enhance the ability to analyze real datasets."
Potential and Pitfalls of Domain-Specific Information Extraction at Web Scale,"In many domains, a plethora of textual information is available on the web as news reports, blog posts, community portals, etc. Information extraction (IE) is the default technique to turn unstructured text into structured fact databases, but systematically applying IE techniques to web input requires highly complex systems, starting from focused crawlers over quality assurance methods to cope with the HTML input to long pipelines of natural language processing and IE algorithms. Although a number of tools for each of these steps exists, their seamless, flexible, and scalable combination into a web scale end-to-end text analytics system still is a true challenge. In this paper, we report our experiences from building such a system for comparing the ""web view"" on health related topics with that derived from a controlled scientific corpus, i.e., Medline. The system combines a focused crawler, applying shallow text analysis and classification to maintain focus, with a sophisticated text analytic engine inside the Big Data processing system Stratosphere. We describe a practical approach to seed generation which led us crawl a corpus of ~1 TB web pages highly enriched for the biomedical domain. Pages were run through a complex pipeline of best-of-breed tools for a multitude of necessary tasks, such as HTML repair, boilerplate detection, sentence detection, linguistic annotation, parsing, and eventually named entity recognition for several types of entities. Results are compared with those from running the same pipeline (without the web-related tasks) on a corpus of 24 million scientific abstracts and a third corpus made of ~250K scientific full texts. We evaluate scalability, quality, and robustness of the employed methods and tools. The focus of this paper is to provide a large, real-life use case to inspire future research into robust, easy-to-use, and scalable methods for domain-specific IE at web scale."
Robust and Noise Resistant Wrapper Induction,"Wrapper induction is the problem of automatically inferring a query from annotated web pages of the same template. This query should not only select the annotated content accurately but also other content following the same template. Beyond accurately matching the template, we consider two additional requirements: (1) wrappers should be robust against a large class of changes to the web pages, and (2) the induction process should be noise resistant, i.e., tolerate slightly erroneous (e.g., machine generated) samples. Key to our approach is a query language that is powerful enough to permit accurate selection, but limited enough to force noisy samples to be generalized into wrappers that select the likely intended items. We introduce such a language as subset of XPATH and show that even for such a restricted language, inducing optimal queries according to a suitable scoring is infeasible. Nevertheless, our wrapper induction framework infers highly robust and noise resistant queries. We evaluate the queries on snapshots from web pages that change over time as provided by the Internet Archive, and show that the induced queries are as robust as the human-made queries. The queries often survive hundreds sometimes thousands of days, with many changes to the relative position of the selected nodes (including changes on template level). This is due to the few and discriminative anchor (intermediately selected) nodes of the generated queries. The queries are highly resistant against positive noise (up to 50%) and negative noise (up to 20%)."

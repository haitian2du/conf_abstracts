Topic Exploration in Spatio-Temporal Document Collections,"Huge amounts of data with both spatial and temporal information (e.g., geo-tagged tweets) are being generated, and are often used to share and spread personal updates, spontaneous ideas, and breaking news. We refer to such data as spatio-temporal documents. It is of great interest to explore topics in a collection of spatio-temporal documents."
ParTime: Parallel Temporal Aggregation,"This paper presents ParTime, a parallel algorithm for temporal aggregation. Temporal aggregation is one of the most important, yet most complex temporal query operators. It has been extensively studied in the past, but so far there has only been one attempt to parallelize this operator. ParTime supports data parallelism and has a number of additional advantages: It supports the full bitemporal data model, it requires no a-priori indexing, it supports shared computation, and it runs well on modern hardware (i.e., NUMA machines with large main memories). We implemented ParTime in a parallel database system and carried out comprehensive performance experiments with a real workload from the airline industry and a synthetic benchmark, the TPC-BiH benchmark. The results show that ParTime significantly outperforms any other available temporal database system. Furthermore, the results show that ParTime is competitive as compared to the Timeline Index, the best known technique to process temporal queries from the research literature and which is based on pre-computation and indexing."
Data Polygamy: The Many-Many Relationships among Urban Spatio-Temporal Data Sets,"The increasing ability to collect data from urban environments, coupled with a push towards openness by governments, has resulted in the availability of numerous spatio-temporal data sets covering diverse aspects of a city. Discovering relationships between these data sets can produce new insights by enabling domain experts to not only test but also generate hypotheses. However, discovering these relationships is difficult. First, a relationship between two data sets may occur only at certain locations and/or time periods. Second, the sheer number and size of the data sets, coupled with the diverse spatial and temporal scales at which the data is available, presents computational challenges on all fronts, from indexing and querying to analyzing them. Finally, it is non-trivial to differentiate between meaningful and spurious relationships. To address these challenges, we propose Data Polygamy, a scalable topology-based framework that allows users to query for statistically significant relationships between spatio-temporal data sets. We have performed an experimental evaluation using over 300 spatial-temporal urban data sets which shows that our approach is scalable and effective at identifying interesting relationships."
Distributed Evaluation of Top-k Temporal Joins,"We study a particular kind of join, coined Ranked Temporal Join (RTJ), featuring predicates that compare time intervals and a scoring function associated with each predicate to quantify how well it is satisfied. RTJ queries are prevalent in a variety of applications such as network traffic monitoring, task scheduling, and tweet analysis. RTJ queries are often best interpreted as top-k queries where only the best matches are returned. We show how to exploit the nature of temporal predicates and the properties of their associated scoring semantics to design TKIJ, an efficient query evaluation approach on a distributed Map-Reduce architecture. TKIJ relies on an offline statistics computation that, given a time partitioning into granules, computes the distribution of intervals' endpoints in each granule, and an online computation that generates query-dependent score bounds. Those statistics are used for workload assignment to reducers. This aims at reducing data replication, to limit I/O cost. Additionally, high-scoring results are distributed evenly to enable each reducer to prune unnecessary results. Our extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that TKIJ outperforms state-of-the-art competitors and provides very good performance for n-ary RTJ queries on temporal data."
AT-GIS: Highly Parallel Spatial Query Processing with Associative Transducers,"Users in many domains, including urban planning, transportation, and environmental science want to execute analytical queries over continuously updated spatial datasets. Current solutions for large-scale spatial query processing either rely on extensions to RDBMS, which entails expensive loading and indexing phases when the data changes, or distributed map/reduce frameworks, running on resource-hungry compute clusters. Both solutions struggle with the sequential bottleneck of parsing complex, hierarchical spatial data formats, which frequently dominates query execution time. Our goal is to fully exploit the parallelism offered by modern multi-core CPUs for parsing and query execution, thus providing the performance of a cluster with the resources of a single machine. We describe AT-GIS, a highly-parallel spatial query processing system that scales linearly to a large number of CPU cores. AT-GIS integrates the parsing and querying of spatial data using a new computational abstraction called associative transducers (ATs). ATs can form a single data-parallel pipeline for computation without requiring the spatial input data to be split into logically independent blocks. Using ATs, AT-GIS can execute, in parallel, spatial query operators on the raw input data in multiple formats, without any pre-processing. On a single 64-core machine, AT-GIT provides 3x the performance of an 8-node Hadoop cluster with 192 cores for containment queries, and 10x for aggregation queries."
Towards Best Region Search for Data Exploration,"The increasing popularity and growth of mobile devices and location-based services enable us to utilize large-scale geo-tagged data to support novel location-based applications. This paper introduces a novel problem called the best region search (BRS) problem and provides efficient solutions to it. Given a set O of spatial objects, a submodular monotone aggregate score function, and the size a x b of a query rectangle, the BRS problem aims to find a x b rectangular region such that the aggregate score of the spatial objects inside the region is maximized. This problem is fundamental to support several real-world applications such as most influential region search (eg. the best location for a signage to attract most audience) and most diversified region search (eg. region with most diverse facilities). We propose an efficient algorithm called SliceBRS to find the exact answer to the BRS problem. Furthermore, we propose an approximate solution called CoverBRS and prove that the answer found by it is bounded by a constant. Our experimental study with real-world datasets and applications demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed algorithms."
Simba: Efficient In-Memory Spatial Analytics,"Large spatial data becomes ubiquitous. As a result, it is critical to provide fast, scalable, and high-throughput spatial queries and analytics for numerous applications in location-based services (LBS). Traditional spatial databases and spatial analytics systems are disk-based and optimized for IO efficiency. But increasingly, data are stored and processed in memory to achieve low latency, and CPU time becomes the new bottleneck. We present the Simba (Spatial In-Memory Big data Analytics) system that offers scalable and efficient in-memory spatial query processing and analytics for big spatial data. Simba is based on Spark and runs over a cluster of commodity machines. In particular, Simba extends the Spark SQL engine to support rich spatial queries and analytics through both SQL and the DataFrame API. It introduces indexes over RDDs in order to work with big spatial data and complex spatial operations. Lastly, Simba implements an effective query optimizer, which leverages its indexes and novel spatial-aware optimizations, to achieve both low latency and high throughput. Extensive experiments over large data sets demonstrate Simba's superior performance compared against other spatial analytics system."

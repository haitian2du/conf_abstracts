Data Management on Non-Volatile Memory,"We are at an exciting point in the evolution of memory technology. Device manufacturers have created a new non- volatile memory (NVM) technology that can serve as both system memory and storage. NVM supports fast reads and writes similar to volatile memory, but all writes to it are persistent like a solid-state disk. The advent of NVM invalidates decades of design decisions that are deeply embedded in today's database management systems (DBMSs). These systems are unable to take full advantage of NVM because their internal architectures are predicated on the assumption that memory is volatile. With NVM, many of the components of today's DBMSs are unnecessary and will degrade the performance of data-intensive applications. Thus, the best way to resolve these shortcomings is by designing a new system explicitly tailored for NVM. In this talk, I will present our research on the design and development of an NVM DBMS, called Peloton. Peloton's architecture shows that the impact of NVM spans across all the layers of the DBMS. I will first introduce write-behind logging, an NVM-centric protocol that improves the availability of the database system by two orders-of-magnitude compared to the widely-used write- ahead logging protocol. I will then present the BzTree, an NVM-centric index data structure that illustrates how to simplify programming on NVM. In drawing broader lessons from this work, I will argue that all types of software systems, including file systems, machine-learning systems, and key-value stores, are amenable to similar architectural changes to achieve high performance and availability on NVM."
Formal Approaches to Querying Big Data in Shared-Nothing Systems,"To meet today's data management needs, it is a widespread practice to use distributed data storage and processing systems. Since the publication of the MapReduce paradigm, a plethora of such systems arose, but although widespread, the capabilities of these systems are still poorly understood and putting them to effective use is often more of an art than a science. As one of the causes for this observation, we identify a lack of theoretical underpinnings for these systems, which makes it hard to understand what the advantages and disadvantages of the particular systems are and which, in addition, complicates the choice of a particular formalism for a particular task. In my PhD thesis, we zoom in on several important aspects of query evaluation using clusters of servers, including coordination and communication, data-skew, load balancing, and data partitioning, and propose a set of elegant and theoretically sound frameworks and theories that help to understand the applicable limitations and trade-offs."

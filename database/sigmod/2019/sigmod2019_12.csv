Interventional Fairness: Causal Database Repair for Algorithmic Fairness,"Fairness is increasingly recognized as a critical component of machine learning systems. However, it is the underlying data on which these systems are trained that often reflect discrimination, suggesting a database repair problem. Existing treatments of fairness rely on statistical correlations that can be fooled by statistical anomalies, such as Simpson's paradox. Proposals for causality-based definitions of fairness can correctly model some of these situations, but they require specification of the underlying causal models. In this paper, we formalize the situation as a database repair problem, proving sufficient conditions for fair classifiers in terms of admissible variables as opposed to a complete causal model. We show that these conditions correctly capture subtle fairness violations. We then use these conditions as the basis for database repair algorithms that provide provable fairness guarantees about classifiers trained on their training labels. We evaluate our algorithms on real data, demonstrating improvement over the state of the art on multiple fairness metrics proposed in the literature while retaining high utility."
Uni-Detect: A Unified Approach to Automated Error Detection in Tables,"Data errors are ubiquitous in tables. Extensive research in this area has resulted in a rich variety of techniques, each often targeting a specific type of errors, e.g., numeric outliers, constraint violations, etc. While these diverse techniques clearly improve data quality, it places a significant burden on humans to configure these techniques with suitable rules and parameters for each data set. For example, an expert is expected to define suitable functional-dependencies between column pairs, or tune appropriate thresholds for outlier-detection algorithms, all of which are specific to one individual data set. As a result, users today often hire experts to cleanse only their high-value data sets. We propose \sj, a unified framework to automatically detect diverse types of errors. Our approach employs a novel ""what-if'' analysis that performs local data perturbations to reason about data abnormality, leveraging classical hypothesis-tests on a large corpus of tables. We test \sj on a wide variety of tables including Wikipedia tables, and make surprising discoveries of thousands of FD violations, numeric outliers, spelling mistakes, etc., with better accuracy than existing algorithms specifically designed for each type of errors. For example, for spelling mistakes, \sj outperforms the state-of-the-art spell-checker from a commercial search engine."
HoloDetect: Few-Shot Learning for Error Detection,"We introduce a few-shot learning framework for error detection. We show that data augmentation (a form of weak supervision) is key to training high-quality, ML-based error detection models that require minimal human involvement. Our framework consists of two parts: (1) an expressive model to learn rich representations that capture the inherent syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of errors; and (2) a data augmentation model that, given a small seed of clean records, uses dataset-specific transformations to automatically generate additional training data. Our key insight is to learn data augmentation policies from the noisy input dataset in a weakly supervised manner. We show that our framework detects errors with an average precision of ~94% and an average recall of ~93% across a diverse array of datasets that exhibit different types and amounts of errors. We compare our approach to a comprehensive collection of error detection methods, ranging from traditional rule-based methods to ensemble-based and active learning approaches. We show that data augmentation yields an average improvement of 20 F1 points while it requires access to 3x fewer labeled examples compared to other ML approaches."
JOSIE: Overlap Set Similarity Search for Finding Joinable Tables in Data Lakes,"We present a new solution for finding joinable tables in massive data lakes: given a table and one join column, find tables that can be joined with the given table on the largest number of distinct values. The problem can be formulated as an overlap set similarity search problem by considering columns as sets and matching values as intersection between sets. Although set similarity search is well-studied in the field of approximate string search (e.g., fuzzy keyword search), the solutions are designed for and evaluated over sets of relatively small size (average set size rarely much over 100 and maximum set size in the low thousands) with modest dictionary sizes (the total number of distinct values in all sets is only a few million). We observe that modern data lakes typically have massive set sizes (with maximum set sizes that may be tens of millions) and dictionaries that include hundreds of millions of distinct values. Our new algorithm, JOSIE (Joining Search using Intersection Estimation) minimizes the cost of set reads and inverted index probes used in finding the top-k sets. We show that JOSIE completely out performs the state-of-the-art overlap set similarity search techniques on data lakes. More surprising, we also consider state-of-the-art approximate algorithm and show that our new exact search algorithm performs almost as well, and even in some cases better, on real data lakes."
Raha: A Configuration-Free Error Detection System,"Detecting erroneous values is a key step in data cleaning. Error detection algorithms usually require a user to provide input configurations in the form of rules or statistical parameters. However, providing a complete, yet correct, set of configurations for each new dataset is not trivial, as the user has to know about both the dataset and the error detection algorithms upfront. In this paper, we present Raha, a new configuration-free error detection system. By generating a limited number of configurations for error detection algorithms that cover various types of data errors, we can generate an expressive feature vector for each tuple value. Leveraging these feature vectors, we propose a novel sampling and classification scheme that effectively chooses the most representative values for training. Furthermore, our system can exploit historical data to filter out irrelevant error detection algorithms and configurations. In our experiments, Raha outperforms the state-of-the-art error detection techniques with no more than 20 labeled tuples on each dataset."
Speculative Distributed CSV Data Parsing for Big Data Analytics,"There has been a recent flurry of interest in providing query capability on raw data in today's big data systems. These raw data must be parsed before processing or use in analytics. Thus, a fundamental challenge in distributed big data systems is that of efficient parallel parsing of raw data. The difficulties come from the inherent ambiguity while independently parsing chunks of raw data without knowing the context of these chunks. Specifically, it can be difficult to find the beginnings and ends of fields and records in these chunks of raw data. To parallelize parsing, this paper proposes a speculation-based approach for the CSV format, arguably the most commonly used raw data format. Due to the syntactic and statistical properties of the format, speculative parsing rarely fails and therefore parsing is efficiently parallelized in a distributed setting. Our speculative approach is also robust, meaning that it can reliably detect syntax errors in CSV data. We experimentally evaluate the speculative, distributed parsing approach in Apache Spark using more than 11,000 real-world datasets, and show that our parser produces significant performance benefits over existing methods."

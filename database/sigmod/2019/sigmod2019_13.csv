CATAPULT: Data-driven Selection of Canned Patterns for Efficient Visual Graph Query Formulation,"Visual graph query interfaces (a.k.a gui ) widen the reach of graph querying frameworks across different users by enabling non-programmers to use them. Consequently, several commercial and academic frameworks for querying a large collection of small- or medium-sized data graphs (\textite.g., chemical compounds) provide such visual interfaces. Majority of these interfaces expose a fixed set ofcanned patterns (\textiti.e., small subgraph patterns) to expedite query formulation by enabling pattern-at-a-time in lieu of edge-at-a-time construction mode. Canned patterns to be displayed on a gui are typically selected manually based on domain knowledge. However, manual generation of canned patterns is labour intensive. Furthermore, these patterns may not sufficiently cover the underlying data graphs to expedite visual formulation of a wide range of subgraph queries. In this paper, we present a generic and extensible framework called Catapult to address these limitations. Catapult takes a data-driven approach toautomatically select canned patterns, thereby taking a concrete step towards the vision of data-driven construction of visual query interfaces. Specifically, it firstclusters the underlying data graphs based on their topological similarities and thensummarize each cluster to create acluster summary graph (csg ). The canned patterns within a user-specifiedpattern budget are then generated from these csg s by maximizingcoverage anddiversity, and minimizingcognitive load of the patterns. Experimental study with real-world datasets and visual graph interfaces demonstrates the superiority of Catapult compared to traditional techniques."
iQCAR: inter-Query Contention Analyzer for Data Analytics Frameworks,"Resource interferences caused by concurrent queries is one of the key reasons for unpredictable performance and missed workload SLAs in cluster computing systems. Analyzing these inter-query resource interactions is critical in order to answer time-sensitive questions like 'who is creating resource conflicts to my query'. More importantly, diagnosing whether the resource blocked times of a 'victim' query are caused by other queries or some other external factor can help the database administrator narrow down the many possibilities of query performance degradation. We introduce iQCAR, an inter-Query Contention Analyzer, that attributes blame for the slowdown of a query to concurrent queries. iQCAR models the resource conflicts using a multi-level directed acyclic graph that can help administrators compare impacts from concurrent queries, identify most contentious queries, resources and hosts in an online execution for a selected time window. Our experiments using TPCDS queries on Apache Spark show that our approach is substantially more accurate than other methods based on overlap time between concurrent queries."
A Holistic Approach for Query Evaluation andResult Vocalization in Voice-Based OLAP,"We focus on the problem of answering OLAP queries via voice output. We present a holistic approach that combines query processing and result vocalization. We use the following key ideas to minimize processing overheads and maximize answer quality. First, our approach samples from the database to evaluate alternative speech fragments. OLAP queries are not fully evaluated. Instead, sampling focuses on result aspects that are relevant for voice output. To guide sampling, we rely on methods from the area of Monte-Carlo Tree Search. Second, we use pipelining to interleave query processing and voice output. The system starts providing the user with high-level insights while generating more fine-grained results in the background. Third, we optimize speech output to maximize the user's information gain under speaking time constraints. We use a maximum-entropy model to predict the user's belief about OLAP results, after listening to voice output. Based on that model, we select the most informative speech fragments (i.e., the ones minimizing the distance between user belief and actual data). We analyze formal properties of the proposed speech structure and analyze complexity of our algorithm. Also, we compare alternative vocalization approaches in an extensive user study."
Top-k Queries over Digital Traces,"Recent advances in social and mobile technology have enabled an abundance of digital traces (in the form of mobile check-ins, association of mobile devices to specific WiFi hotspots, etc.) revealing the physical presence history of diverse sets of entities (e.g., humans, devices, and vehicles). One challenging yet important task is to identify k entities that are most closely associated with a given query entity based on their digital traces. We propose a suite of indexing techniques and algorithms to enable fast query processing for this problem at scale. We first define a generic family of functions measuring the association between entities, and then propose algorithms to transform digital traces into a lower-dimensional space for more efficient computation. We subsequently design a hierarchical indexing structure to organize entities in a way that closely associated entities tend to appear together. We then develop algorithms to process top-k queries utilizing the index. We theoretically analyze the pruning effectiveness of the proposed methods based on a mobility model which we propose and validate in real life situations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets at scale, evaluating the performance of our techniques both analytically and experimentally, confirming the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over other applicable approaches across a variety of parameter settings and datasets."
Visual Road: A Video Data Management Benchmark,"Recently, video database management systems (VDBMSs) have re-emerged as an active area of research and development. To accelerate innovation in this area, we present Visual Road, a benchmark that evaluates the performance of these systems. Visual Road comes with a data generator and a suite of queries over cameras positioned within a simulated metropolitan environment. Visual Road's video data is automatically generated with a high degree of realism, and annotated using a modern simulation and visualization engine. This allows for VDBMS performance evaluation while scaling up the size of the input data. Visual Road is designed to evaluate a broad variety of VDBMSs: real-time systems, systems for longitudinal analytical queries, systems processing traditional videos, and systems designed for 360 videos. We use the benchmark to evaluate three recent VDBMSs both in capabilities and performance."
Mining Precision Interfaces From Query Logs,"Interactive tools make data analysis more efficient and more accessible to end-users by hiding the underlying query complexity and exposing interactive widgets for the parts of the query that matter to the analysis. However, creating custom tailored (i.e., precise) interfaces is very costly, and automated approaches are desirable. We propose a syntactic approach that uses queries from an analysis to generate a tailored interface. We model interface widgets as functions I(q) - > q' that modify the current analysis query q, and interfaces as the set of queries that its widgets can express. Our system, Precision Interfaces, analyzes structural changes between input queries from an analysis, and generates an output interface with widgets to express those changes. Our experiments on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey query log suggest that Precision Interfaces can generate useful interfaces for simple unanticipated tasks, and our optimizations can generate interfaces from logs of up to 10,000 queries in >10s."

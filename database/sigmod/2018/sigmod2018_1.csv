Robust Entity Resolution using Random Graphs,"Entity resolution (ER) seeks to identify which records in a data set refer to the same real-world entity. Given the diversity of ways in which entities can be represented, matched and distinguished, ER is known to be a challenging task for automated strategies, but relatively easier for expert humans. In our work, we abstract the knowledge of experts with the notion of a binary oracle. Our oracle can answer questions of the form ""do records u and v refer to the same entity?"" under a flexible error model, allowing for some questions to be more difficult to answer correctly than others."
Deep Learning for Entity Matching: A Design Space Exploration,"Entity matching (EM) finds data instances that refer to the same real-world entity. In this paper we examine applying deep learning (DL) to EM, to understand DL's benefits and limitations. We review many DL solutions that have been developed for related matching tasks in text processing (e.g., entity linking, textual entailment, etc.). We categorize these solutions and define a space of DL solutions for EM, as embodied by four solutions with varying representational power: SIF, RNN, Attention, and Hybrid. Next, we investigate the types of EM problems for which DL can be helpful. We consider three such problem types, which match structured data instances, textual instances, and dirty instances, respectively. We empirically compare the above four DL solutions with Magellan, a state-of-the-art learning-based EM solution. The results show that DL does not outperform current solutions on structured EM, but it can significantly outperform them on textual and dirty EM. For practitioners, this suggests that they should seriously consider using DL for textual and dirty EM problems. Finally, we analyze DL's performance and discuss future research directions."
Synthesizing Type-Detection Logic for Rich Semantic Data Types using Open-source Code,"Given a table of data, existing systems can often detect basic atomic types (e.g., strings vs. numbers) for each column. A new generation of data-analytics and data-preparation systems are starting to automatically recognize rich semantic types such as date-time, email address, etc., for such metadata can bring an array of benefits including better table understanding, improved search relevance, precise data validation, and semantic data transformation. However, existing approaches only detect a limited number of types using regular-expression-like patterns, which are often inaccurate, and cannot handle rich semantic types such as credit card and ISBN numbers that encode semantic validations (e.g., checksum)."
Fine-grained Concept Linking using Neural Networks in Healthcare,"To unlock the wealth of the healthcare data, we often need to link the real-world text snippets to the referred medical concepts described by the canonical descriptions. However, existing healthcare concept linking methods, such as dictionary-based and simple machine learning methods, are not effective due to the word discrepancy between the text snippet and the canonical concept description, and the overlapping concept meaning among the fine-grained concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a Neural Concept Linking (NCL) approach for accurate concept linking using systematically integrated neural networks. We call the novel neural network architecture as the COMposite AttentIonal encode-Decode neural network (COM-AID). COM-AID performs an encode-decode process that encodes a concept into a vector and decodes the vector into a text snippet with the help of two devised contexts. On the one hand, it injects the textual context into the neural network through the attention mechanism, so that the word discrepancy can be overcome from the semantic perspective. On the other hand, it incorporates the structural context into the neural network through the attention mechanism, so that minor concept meaning differences can be enlarged and effectively differentiated. Empirical studies on two real-world datasets confirm that the NCL produces accurate concept linking results and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques."
Big Data Linkage for Product Specification Pages,"An increasing number of product pages are available from thousands of web sources, each page associated with a product, containing its attributes and one or more product identifiers. The sources provide overlapping information about the products, using diverse schemas, making web-scale integration extremely challenging. In this paper, we take advantage of the opportunity that sources publish product identifiers to perform big data linkage across sources at the beginning of the data integration pipeline, before schema alignment. To realize this opportunity, several challenges need to be addressed: identifiers need to be discovered on product pages, made difficult by the diversity of identifiers; the main product identifier on the page needs to be identified, made difficult by the many related products presented on the page; and identifiers across pages need to beresolved, made difficult by the ambiguity between identifiers across product categories. We present our RaF (Redundancy as Friend) solution to the problem of big data linkage for product specification pages, which takes advantage of the redundancy of identifiers at a global level, and the homogeneity of structure and semantics at the local source level, to effectively and efficiently link millions of pages of head and tail products across thousands of head and tail sources. We perform a thorough empirical evaluation of our RaF approach using the publicly available Dexter dataset consisting of 1.9M product pages from 7.1k sources of 3.5k websites, and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice."

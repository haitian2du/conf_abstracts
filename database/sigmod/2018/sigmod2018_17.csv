SketchML: Accelerating Distributed Machine Learning with Data Sketches,"To address the challenge of explosive big data, distributed machine learning (ML) has drawn the interests of many researchers. Since many distributed ML algorithms trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) involve communicating gradients through the network, it is important to compress the transferred gradient. A category of low-precision algorithms can significantly reduce the size of gradients, at the expense of some precision loss. However, existing low-precision methods are not suitable for many cases where the gradients are sparse and nonuniformly distributed. In this paper, we study is there a compression method that can efficiently handle a sparse and nonuniform gradient consisting of key-value pairs?"
MISTIQUE: A System to Store and Query Model Intermediates for Model Diagnosis,"Model diagnosis is the process of analyzing machine learning (ML) model performance to identify where the model works well and where it doesn't. It is a key part of the modeling process and helps ML developers iteratively improve model accuracy. Often, model diagnosis is performed by analyzing different datasets or intermediates associated with the model such as the input data and hidden representations learned by the model (e.g., [4, 24, 39,]). The bottleneck in fast model diagnosis is the creation and storage of model intermediates. Storing these intermediates requires tens to hundreds of GB of storage whereas re-running the model for each diagnostic query slows down model diagnosis. To address this bottleneck, we propose a system called MISTIQUE that can work with traditional ML pipelines as well as deep neural networks to efficiently capture, store, and query model intermediates for diagnosis. For each diagnostic query, MISTIQUE intelligently chooses whether to re-run the model or read a previously stored intermediate. For intermediates that are stored in MISTIQUE, we propose a range of optimizations to reduce storage footprint including quantization, summarization, and data de-duplication. We evaluate our techniques on a range of real-world ML models in scikit-learn and Tensorflow. We demonstrate that our optimizations reduce storage by up to 110X for traditional ML pipelines and up to 6X for deep neural networks. Furthermore, by using MISTIQUE, we can speed up diagnostic queries on traditional ML pipelines by up to 390X and 210X on deep neural networks."
Fonduer: Knowledge Base Construction from Richly Formatted Data,"We focus on knowledge base construction (KBC) from richly formatted data. In contrast to KBC from text or tabular data, KBC from richly formatted data aims to extract relations conveyed jointly via textual, structural, tabular, and visual expressions. We introduce Fonduer, a machine-learning-based KBC system for richly formatted data. Fonduer presents a new data model that accounts for three challenging characteristics of richly formatted data: (1) prevalent document-level relations, (2) multimodality, and (3) data variety. Fonduer uses a new deep-learning model to automatically capture the representation (i.e., features) needed to learn how to extract relations from richly formatted data. Finally, Fonduer provides a new programming model that enables users to convert domain expertise, based on multiple modalities of information, to meaningful signals of supervision for training a KBC system. Fonduer-based KBC systems are in production for a range of use cases, including at a major online retailer. We compare Fonduer against state-of-the-art KBC approaches in four different domains. We show that Fonduer achieves an average improvement of 41 F1 points on the quality of the output knowledge base---and in some cases produces up to 1.87x the number of correct entries---compared to expert-curated public knowledge bases. We also conduct a user study to assess the usability of Fonduer's new programming model. We show that after using Fonduer for only 30 minutes, non-domain experts are able to design KBC systems that achieve on average 23 F1 points higher quality than traditional machine-learning-based KBC approaches."
Maverick: Discovering Exceptional Facts from Knowledge Graphs,"We present Maverick, a general, extensible framework that discovers exceptional facts about entities in knowledge graphs. To the best of our knowledge, there was no previous study of the problem. We model an exceptional fact about an entity of interest as a context-subspace pair, in which a subspace is a set of attributes and a context is defined by a graph query pattern of which the entity is a match. The entity is exceptional among the entities in the context, with regard to the subspace. The search spaces of both patterns and subspaces are exponentially large. Maverick conducts beam search on the patterns which uses a match-based pattern construction method to evade the evaluation of invalid patterns. It applies two heuristics to select promising patterns to form the beam in each iteration. Maverick traverses and prunes the subspaces organized as a set enumeration tree by exploiting the upper bound properties of exceptionality scoring functions. Results of experiments and user studies using real-world datasets demonstrated substantial performance improvement of the proposed framework over the baselines as well as its effectiveness in discovering exceptional facts."
A General and Efficient Querying Method for Learning to Hash,"As an effective solution to the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) search problem, learning to hash (L2H) is able to learn similarity-preserving hash functions tailored for a given dataset. However, existing L2H research mainly focuses on improving query performance by learning good hash functions, while Hamming ranking (HR) is used as the default querying method. We show by analysis and experiments that Hamming distance, the similarity indicator used in HR, is too coarse-grained and thus limits the performance of query processing. We propose a new fine-grained similarity indicator, quantization distance (QD), which provides more information about the similarity between a query and the items in a bucket. We then develop two efficient querying methods based on QD, which achieve significantly better query performance than HR. Our methods are general and can work with various L2H algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple and elegant querying method can produce performance gain equivalent to advanced and complicated learning algorithms."
Subjective Knowledge Base Construction Powered By Crowdsourcing and Knowledge Base,"Knowledge base construction (KBC) has become a hot and in-time topic recently with the increasing application need of large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), such as semantic search, QA systems, the Google Knowledge Graph and IBM Watson QA System. Existing KBs mainly focus on encoding the factual facts of the world, e.g., city area and company product, which are regarded as the objective knowledge, whereas the subjective knowledge, which is frequently mentioned in Web queries, has been neglected. The subjective knowledge has no documented ground truth, instead, the truth relies on people's dominant opinion, which can be solicited from online crowd workers. In our work, we propose a KBC framework for subjective knowledge base construction taking advantage of the knowledge from the crowd and existing KBs. We develop a two-staged framework for subjective KB construction which consists of core subjective KB construction and subjective KB enrichment. Firstly, we try to build a core subjective KB mined from existing KBs, where every instance has rich objective properties. Then, we populate the core subjective KB with instances extracted from existing KBs, in which the crowd is leverage to annotate the subjective property of the instances. In order to optimize the crowd annotation process, we formulate the problem of subjective KB enrichment procedure as a cost-aware instance annotation problem and propose two instance annotation algorithms, i.e., adaptive instance annotation and batch-mode instance annotation algorithms. We develop a two-stage system for subjective KB construction which consists of core subjective KB construction and subjective knowledge enrichment. We evaluate our framework on real knowledge bases and a real crowdsourcing platform, the experimental results show that we can derive high quality subjective knowledge facts from existing KBs and crowdsourcing techniques through our proposed framework."
DimBoost: Boosting Gradient Boosting Decision Tree to Higher Dimensions,"Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is one of the most popular machine learning models widely used in both academia and industry. Although GBDT has been widely supported by existing systems such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and MLlib, one system bottleneck appears when the dimensionality of the data becomes high. As a result, when we tried to support our industrial partner on datasets of the dimension up to 330K, we observed suboptimal performance for all these aforementioned systems. In this paper, we ask ""Can we build a scalable GBDT training system whose performance scales better with respect to dimensionality of the data?"""
Auto-Detect: Data-Driven Error Detection in Tables,"Given a single column of values, existing approaches typically employ regex-like rules to detect errors by finding anomalous values inconsistent with others. Such techniques make local decisions based only on values in the given input column, without considering a more global notion of compatibility that can be inferred from large corpora of clean tables. We propose \sj, a statistics-based technique that leverages co-occurrence statistics from large corpora for error detection, which is a significant departure from existing rule-based methods. Our approach can automatically detect incompatible values, by leveraging an ensemble of judiciously selected generalization languages, each of which uses different generalizations and is sensitive to different types of errors. Errors so detected are based on global statistics, which is robust and aligns well with human intuition of errors. We test \sj on a large set of public Wikipedia tables, as well as proprietary enterprise Excel files. While both of these test sets are supposed to be of high-quality, \sj makes surprising discoveries of over tens of thousands of errors in both cases, which are manually verified to be of high precision (over 0.98). Our labeled benchmark set on Wikipedia tables is released for future research."

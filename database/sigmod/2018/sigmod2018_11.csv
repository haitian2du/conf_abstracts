When Hierarchy Meets 2-Hop-Labeling: Efficient Shortest Distance Queries on Road Networks,"Computing the shortest distance between two vertices is a fundamental problem in road networks. Since a direct search using the Dijkstra's algorithm results in a large search space, researchers resort to indexing-based approaches. State-of-the-art indexing-based solutions can be categorized into hierarchy-based solutions and hopbased solutions. However, the hierarchy-based solutions require a large search space for long-distance queries while the hop-based solutions result in a high computational waste for short-distance queries. To overcome the drawbacks of both solutions, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical 2-hop index (H2H-Index) which assigns a label for each vertex and at the same time preserves a hierarchy among all vertices. With the H2H-Index, we design an efficient query processing algorithm with performance guarantees by visiting part of the labels for the source and destination based on the vertex hierarchy. We also propose an algorithm to construct the H2H-Index based on distance preserved graphs. The algorithm is further optimized by computing the labels based on the partially computed labels of other vertices. We conducted extensive performance studies using large real road networks including the whole USA road network. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a speedup of an order of magnitude in query processing compared to the state-of-the-art while consuming comparable indexing time and index size."
DITA: Distributed In-Memory Trajectory Analytics,"Trajectory analytics can benefit many real-world applications, e.g., frequent trajectory based navigation systems, road planning, car pooling, and transportation optimizations. Existing algorithms focus on optimizing this problem in a single machine. However, the amount of trajectories exceeds the storage and processing capability of a single machine, and it calls for large-scale trajectory analytics in distributed environments. The distributed trajectory analytics faces challenges of data locality aware partitioning, load balance, easy-to-use interface, and versatility to support various trajectory similarity functions. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed in-memory trajectory analytics system DITA. We propose an effective partitioning method, global index and local index, to address the data locality problem. We devise cost-based techniques to balance the workload. We develop a filter-verification framework to improve the performance. Moreover, DITA can support most of existing similarity functions to quantify the similarity between trajectories. We integrate our framework seamlessly into Spark SQL, and make it support SQL and DataFrame API interfaces. We have conducted extensive experiments on real world datasets, and experimental results show that DITA outperforms existing distributed trajectory similarity search and join approaches significantly."
Cold Filter: A Meta-Framework for Faster and More Accurate Stream Processing,"Approximate stream processing algorithms, such as Count-Min sketch, Space-Saving, etc., support numerous applications in databases, storage systems, networking, and other domains. However, the unbalanced distribution in real data streams poses great challenges to existing algorithms. To enhance these algorithms, we propose a meta-framework, called Cold Filter (CF), that enables faster and more accurate stream processing."
Sketching Linear Classifiers over Data Streams,"We introduce a new sub-linear space sketch---the Weight-Median Sketch---for learning compressed linear classifiers over data streams while supporting the efficient recovery of large-magnitude weights in the model. This enables memory-limited execution of several statistical analyses over streams, including online feature selection, streaming data explanation, relative deltoid detection, and streaming estimation of pointwise mutual information. Unlike related sketches that capture the most frequently-occurring features (or items) in a data stream, the Weight-Median Sketch captures the features that are most discriminative of one stream (or class) compared to another. The Weight-Median Sketch adopts the core data structure used in the Count-Sketch, but, instead of sketching counts, it captures sketched gradient updates to the model parameters. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes recovery guarantees for batch and online learning, and demonstrate empirical improvements in memory-accuracy trade-offs over alternative memory-budgeted methods, including count-based sketches and feature hashing."
Dynamic Pricing in Spatial Crowdsourcing: A Matching-Based Approach,"In spatial crowdsourcing, requesters submit their task-related locations and increase the demand of a local area. The platform prices these tasks and assigns spatial workers to serve if the prices are accepted by requesters. There exist mature pricing strategies which specialize in tackling the imbalance between supply and demand in a local market. However, in global optimization, the platform should consider the mobility of workers; that is, any single worker can be the potential supply for several areas, while it can only be the true supply of one area when assigned by the platform. The hardness lies in the uncertainty of the true supply of each area, hence the existing pricing strategies do not work. In the paper, we formally define this <u>G</u>lobal <u>D</u>ynamic <u>P</u>ricing(GDP) problem in spatial crowdsourcing. And since the objective is concerned with how the platform matches the supply to areas, we let the matching algorithm guide us how to price. We propose a <u>MA</u>tching-based <u>P</u>ricing <u>S</u>trategy (MAPS) with guaranteed bound. Extensive experiments conducted on the synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPS."

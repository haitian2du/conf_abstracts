Query-based Workload Forecasting for Self-Driving Database Management Systems,"The first step towards an autonomous database management system (DBMS) is the ability to model the target application's workload. This is necessary to allow the system to anticipate future workload needs and select the proper optimizations in a timely manner. Previous forecasting techniques model the resource utilization of the queries. Such metrics, however, change whenever the physical design of the database and the hardware resources change, thereby rendering previous forecasting models useless."
RushMon: Real-time Isolation Anomalies Monitoring,"Motivated by the applicability of HogWild!-style algorithms, people turn their focus on system architectures that provide ultra-high throughput random-access with very limited or no isolation guarantees, and build inconsistent-tolerant applications (i.e., large scale optimization algorithms) on top of them. Although some optimization algorithms have theoretical convergence guarantees, sometimes these systems fail to compute the correct results when the presumptions of convergence cannot hold. Moreover, there is no practical way to tell whether a given result is accurate (without cross validation) or to tune the isolation strength on-the-fly. To resolve these problems, these systems need an indicator to report the number of ""bad event"" caused by ""out-of-order"" executions. In this paper, we tackle this problem. Based on transaction processing theory, we find the number of cycles in the dependency graph, and demonstrate it is a good indicator. With this observation, we propose the first real-time isolation anomalies monitor. Our monitor is at least 1000x faster than naive implementations and reports accurate isolation anomalies levels with less than 1% extra overhead. Monitoring anomalies in a real-time manner efficiently protects the systems from excessive isolation anomalies which could lead to incorrect results. We verify the performance and effectiveness of our monitor via extensive experimental studies."
On the Calculation of Optimality Ranges for Relational Query Execution Plans,"Cardinality estimation is a crucial task in query optimization and typically relies on heuristics and basic statistical approximations. At execution time, estimation errors might result in situations where intermediate result sizes may differ from the estimated ones, so that the originally chosen plan is not the optimal plan anymore. In this paper we analyze the deviation from the estimate, and denote the cardinality range of an intermediate result, where the optimal plan remains optimal as the optimality range. While previous work used simple heuristics to calculate similar ranges, we generate the precise bounds for the optimality range considering all relevant plan alternatives. Our experimental results show that the fixed optimality ranges used in previous work fail to characterize the range of cardinalities where a plan is optimal. We derive theoretical worst case bounds for the number of enumerated plans required to compute the precise optimality range, and experimentally show that in real queries this number is significantly smaller. Our experiments also show the benefit for applications like Mid-Query Re-Optimization in terms of significant execution time improvement."
Adaptive Optimization of Very Large Join Queries,"The use of business intelligence tools and other means to generate queries has led to great variety in the size of join queries. While most queries are reasonably small, join queries with up to a hundred relations are not that exotic anymore, and the distribution of query sizes has an incredible long tail. The largest real-world query that we are aware of accesses more than 4,000 relations. This large spread makes query optimization very challenging. Join ordering is known to be NP-hard, which means that we cannot hope to solve such large problems exactly. On the other hand most queries are much smaller, and there is no reason to sacrifice optimality there. This paper introduces an adaptive optimization framework that is able to solve most common join queries exactly, while simultaneously scaling to queries with thousands of joins. A key component there is a novel search space linearization technique that leads to near-optimal execution plans for large classes of queries. In addition, we describe implementation techniques that are necessary to scale join ordering algorithms to these extremely large queries. Extensive experiments with over 10 different approaches show that the new adaptive approach proposed here performs excellent over a huge spectrum of query sizes, and produces optimal or near-optimal solutions for most common queries."
Improving Join Reorderability with Compensation Operators,"A critical task in query optimization is the join reordering problem which is to find an efficient evaluation order for the join operators in a query plan. While the join reordering problem is well studied for queries with only inner-joins, the problem becomes considerably harder when outerjoins/antijoins are involved as such operators are generally not associative. The existing solutions for this problem do not enumerate the complete space of join orderings due to various restrictions on the query rewriting rules considered. In this paper, we present a novel approach for this problem for the class of queries involving inner-joins, single-sided outerjoins, and/or antijoins. Our work is able to support complete join reorderability for this class of queries which supersedes the state-of-the-art approaches."

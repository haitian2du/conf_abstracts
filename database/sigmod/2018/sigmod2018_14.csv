BOOMER: Blending Visual Formulation and Processing of P -Homomorphic Queries on Large Networks,"Visual graph query interfaces (a.k.a GUI) make it easy for non-expert users to query graphs. Recent research has laid out and implemented a vision of a novel subgraph query processing paradigm where the latency offered by the GUI is exploited to blend visual query construction and processing by generating and refining candidate result matches iteratively during query formulation. This paradigm brings in several potential benefits such as superior system response time (srt) and opportunities to enhance usability of graph databases. However, these early efforts focused on subgraph isomorphism-based graph queries where blending is performed by iterative edge-to-edge mapping. In this paper, we explore how this vision can be realized for more generic but complex 1-1 p-homomorphic p-hom) queries introduced by Fan et al. A 1-1 p-hom query maps an edge of the query to paths in the data graph. We present a novel framework called BOOMER for blending bounded 1-1 p-hom (bph ) queries, a variant of 1-1 p-hom where the length of the path is bounded instead of arbitrary length. Our framework is based on a novel online , adaptive indexing scheme called cap index. We present two strategies for CAP index construction, immediate and deferment-based, and show how they can be utilized to facilitate judicious interleaving of visual bph query formulation and query processing. BOOMER is also amenable to modifications to a bph query during visual formulation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness of Boomer for realizing the visual querying paradigm on an important type of graph query."
Navigating the Data Lake with DATAMARAN: Automatically Extracting Structure from Log Datasets,"Organizations routinely accumulate semi-structured log datasets generated as the output of code; these datasets remain unused and uninterpreted, and occupy wasted space---this phenomenon has been colloquially referred to as ""data lake'' problem. One approach to leverage these semi-structured datasets is to convert them into a structured relational format, following which they can be analyzed in conjunction with other datasets. We present DATAMARAN, an tool that extracts structure from semi-structured log datasets with no human supervision. DATAMARAN automatically identifies field and record endpoints, separates the structured parts from the unstructured noise or formatting, and can tease apart multiple structures from within a dataset, in order to efficiently extract structured relational datasets from semi-structured log datasets, at scale with high accuracy. Compared to other unsupervised log dataset extraction tools developed in prior work, DATAMARAN does not require the record boundaries to be known beforehand, making it much more applicable to the noisy log files that are ubiquitous in data lakes. DATAMARAN can successfully extract structured information from all datasets used in prior work, and can achieve 95% extraction accuracy on automatically collected log datasets from GitHub---a substantial 66% increase of accuracy compared to unsupervised schemes from prior work. Our user study further demonstrates that the extraction results of DATAMARAN are closer to the desired structure than competing algorithms."
Efficient k-Regret Query Algorithm with Restriction-free Bound for any Dimensionality,"Extracting interesting tuples from a large database is an important problem in multi-criteria decision making. Two representative queries were proposed in the literature: top- k queries and skyline queries. A top- k query requires users to specify their utility functions beforehand and then returns k tuples to the users. A skyline query does not require any utility function from users but it puts no control on the number of tuples returned to users. Recently, a k-regret query was proposed and received attention from the community because it does not require any utility function from users and the output size is controllable, and thus it avoids those deficiencies of top- k queries and skyline queries. Specifically, it returns k tuples that minimize a criterion called the maximum regret ratio ."
A Rating-Ranking Method for Crowdsourced Top-k Computation,"Crowdsourced top- k computation aims to utilize the human ability to identify Top- k objects from a given set of objects. Most of existing studies employ a pairwise comparison based method, which first asks workers to compare each pair of objects and then infers the Top- k results based on the pairwise comparison results. Obviously, it is quadratic to compare every object pair and these methods involve huge monetary cost, especially for large datasets. To address this problem, we propose a rating-ranking-based approach, which contains two types of questions to ask the crowd. The first is a rating question, which asks the crowd to give a score for an object. The second is a ranking question, which asks the crowd to rank several (e.g., 3) objects. Rating questions are coarse grained and can roughly get a score for each object, which can be used to prune the objects whose scores are much smaller than those of the Top- k objects. Ranking questions are fine grained and can be used to refine the scores. We propose a unified model to model the rating and ranking questions, and seamlessly combine them together to compute the Top- k results. We also study how to judiciously select appropriate rating or ranking questions and assign them to a coming worker. Experimental results on real datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches."
Online Processing Algorithms for Influence Maximization,"Influence maximization is a classic and extensively studied problem with important applications in viral marketing. Existing algorithms for influence maximization, however, mostly focus on offline processing, in the sense that they do not provide any output to the user until the final answer is derived, and that the user is not allowed to terminate the algorithm early to trade the quality of solution for efficiency. Such lack of interactiveness and flexibility leads to poor user experience, especially when the algorithm incurs long running time."
Top-k Sorting Under Partial Order Information,"We address the problem of sorting the top-k elements of a set, given a predefined partial order over the set elements. Our means to obtain missing order information is via a comparison operator that interacts with a crowd of domain experts to determine the order between two unordered items. The practical motivation for studying this problem is the common scenario where elements cannot be easily compared by machines and thus human experts are harnessed for this task. As some initial partial order is given, our goal is to optimally exploit it in order to minimize the domain experts work."

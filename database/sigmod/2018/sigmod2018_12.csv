"Amazon Aurora: On Avoiding Distributed Consensus for I/Os, Commits, and Membership Changes","Amazon Aurora is a high-throughput cloud-native relational database offered as part of Amazon Web Services (AWS). One of the more novel differences between Aurora and other relational databases is how it pushes redo processing to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service, purpose-built for Aurora. Doing so reduces networking traffic, avoids checkpoints and crash recovery, enables failovers to replicas without loss of data, and enables fault-tolerant storage that heals without database involvement. Traditional implementations that leverage distributed storage would use distributed consensus algorithms for commits, reads, replication, and membership changes and amplify cost of underlying storage. In this paper, we describe how Aurora avoids distributed consensus under most circumstances by establishing invariants and leveraging local transient state. Doing so improves performance, reduces variability, and lowers costs."
Eon Mode: Bringing the Vertica Columnar Database to the Cloud,"The Vertica Analytic Database is a powerful tool for high performance, large scale SQL analytics. Historically, Vertica has managed direct-attached disk for performance and reliability, at a cost of product complexity and scalability. Eon mode is a new architecture for Vertica that places the data on a reliable shared storage, matching the original architecture's performance on existing workloads and supporting new workloads. While the design reuses Vertica's optimizer and execution engine, the metadata, storage, and fault tolerance mechanisms are re-architected to enable and take advantage of shared storage. A sharding mechanism distributes load over the nodes while retaining the capability of running node-local table joins. Running on Amazon EC2 compute and S3 storage, Eon mode demonstrates good performance, superior scalability, and robust operational behavior. With these improvements, Vertica delivers on the promise of cloud economics, consuming only the compute and storage resources needed, while supporting efficient elasticity."
Survivability of Cloud Databases - Factors and Prediction,"Public cloud database providers observe all sorts of different usage patterns and behaviors while operating their services. Service providers such as Microsoft try to understand and characterize these behaviors in order to improve the quality of their service, provide new features for customers, and/or increase the efficiency of the operations. While there are many types of patterns of behavior that are of interest to providers, such as query types, workload intensity, and temporal activity, in this paper, we focus on the lowest level of behavior -- how long do public cloud databases survive before being dropped? Given the large and diverse relational database population that Azure SQL DB has, we present a large-scale survivability study of our service and identify some factors that can demonstrably help predict the lifespan of cloud databases. The results of this study are being used to influence how Azure SQL DB operates in order to increase efficiency as well as improve customer experience."
Rapid Adoption of Cloud Data Warehouse Technology Using Datometry Hyper-Q,"The database industry is about to undergo a fundamental transformation of unprecedented magnitude as enterprises start trading their well-established database stacks on premises for cloud database technology in order to take advantage of the economics cloud service providers have long promised. Industry experts and analysts expect the next years to prove a watershed moment in this transformation, as cloud databases finally reached critical mass and maturity."

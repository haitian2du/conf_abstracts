The Data Interaction Game,"As many users do not precisely know the structure and/or the content of databases, their queries do not exactly reflect their information needs. The database management systems (DBMS) may interact with users and leverage their feedback on the returned results to learn the information needs behind users' queries. Current query interfaces assume that users follow a fixed strategy of expressing their information needs, that is, the likelihood by which a user submits a query to express an information need remains unchanged during her interaction with the DBMS. Using a real-world interaction workload, we show that users learn and modify how to express their information needs during their interactions with the DBMS. We also show that users' learning is accurately modeled by a well-known reinforcement learning mechanism. As current data interaction systems assume that users do not modify their strategies, they cannot discover the information needs behind users' queries effectively. We model the interaction between users and DBMS as a game with identical interest between two rational agents whose goal is to establish a common language for representing information needs in form of queries. We propose a reinforcement learning method that learns and answers the information needs behind queries and adapts to the changes in users' strategies and prove that it improves the effectiveness of answering queries stochastically speaking. We analyze the challenges of efficient implementation of this method over large-scale relational databases and propose two efficient adaptations of this algorithm over large-scale relational databases. Our extensive empirical studies over real-world query workloads and large-scale relational databases indicate that our algorithms are efficient. Our empirical results also show that our proposed learning mechanism is more effective than the state-of-the-art query answering method."
Data Citation: Giving Credit Where Credit is Due,"An increasing amount of information is being published in structured databases and retrieved using queries, raising the question of how query results should be cited. Since there are a large number of possible queries over a database, one strategy is to specify citations to a small set of frequent queries - citation views - and use these to construct citations to other ""general"" queries. We present three approaches to implementing citation views and describe alternative policies for the joint, alternate and aggregated use of citation views. Extensive experiments using both synthetic and realistic citation views and queries show the trade-offs between the approaches in terms of the time to generate citations, as well as the size of the resulting citation. They also show that the choice of policy has a huge effect both on performance and size, leading to useful guidelines for what policies to use and how to specify citation views."
EKTELO: A Framework for Defining Differentially-Private Computations,"The adoption of differential privacy is growing but the complexity of designing private, efficient and accurate algorithms is still high. We propose a novel programming framework and system, Ektelo, for implementing both existing and new privacy algorithms. For the task of answering linear counting queries, we show that nearly all existing algorithms can be composed from operators, each conforming to one of a small number of operator classes. While past programming frameworks have helped to ensure the privacy of programs, the novelty of our framework is its significant support for authoring accurate and efficient (as well as private) programs. After describing the design and architecture of the Ektelo system, we show that Ektelo is expressive, that it allows for safer implementations through code reuse, and that it allows both privacy novices and experts to easily design algorithms. We demonstrate the use of Ektelo by designing several new state-of-the-art algorithms."
Marginal Release Under Local Differential Privacy,"Many analysis and machine learning tasks require the availability of marginal statistics on multidimensional datasets while providing strong privacy guarantees for the data subjects. Applications for these statistics range from finding correlations in the data to fitting sophisticated prediction models. In this paper, we provide a set of algorithms for materializing marginal statistics under the strong model of local differential privacy. We prove the first tight theoretical bounds on the accuracy of marginals compiled under each approach, perform empirical evaluation to confirm these bounds, and evaluate them for tasks such as modeling and correlation testing. Our results show that releasing information based on (local) Fourier transformations of the input is preferable to alternatives based directly on (local) marginals."
When Query Authentication Meets Fine-Grained Access Control: A Zero-Knowledge Approach,"Query authentication has been extensively studied to ensure the integrity of query results for outsourced databases, which are often not fully trusted. However, access control, another important security concern, is largely ignored by existing works. Notably, recent breakthroughs in cryptography have enabled fine-grained access control over outsourced data. In this paper, we take the first step toward studying the problem of authenticating relational queries with fine-grained access control. The key challenge is how to protect information confidentiality during query authentication, which is essential to many critical applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel access-policy-preserving (APP) signature as the primitive authenticated data structure. A useful property of the APP signature is that it can be used to derive customized signatures for unauthorized users to prove the inaccessibility while achieving the zero-knowledge confidentiality. We also propose a grid-index-based tree structure that can aggregate APP signatures for efficient range and join query authentication. In addition to this, a number of optimization techniques are proposed to further improve the authentication performance. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed solutions and techniques are robust and efficient under various system settings."
Practical and Secure Substring Search,"In this paper we address the problem of outsourcing sensitive strings while still providing the functionality of substring searches. While security is one important aspect that requires careful system design, the practical application of the solution depends on feasible processing time and integration efforts into existing systems. That is, searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows queries on encrypted data but makes common indexing techniques used in database management systems for fast query processing impossible. As a result, the overhead for deploying such functional and secure encryption schemes into database systems while maintaining acceptable processing time requires carefully designed special purpose index structures. Such structures are not available on common database systems but require individual modifications depending on the deployed SSE scheme."

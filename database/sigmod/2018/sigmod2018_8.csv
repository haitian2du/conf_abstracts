Pinot: Realtime OLAP for 530 Million Users,"Modern users demand analytical features on fresh, real time data. Offering these analytical features to hundreds of millions of users is a relevant problem encountered by many large scale web companies."
"Robust, Scalable, Real-Time Event Time Series Aggregation at Twitter","Twitter's data engineering team is faced with the challenge of processing billions of events every day in batch and in real time, and we have built various tools to meet these demands. In this paper, we describe TSAR (TimeSeries AggregatoR), a robust, scalable, real-time event time series aggregation framework built primarily for engagement monitoring: aggregating interactions with Tweets, segmented along a multitude of dimensions such as device, engagement type, etc. TSAR is built on top of Summingbird, an open-source framework for integrating batch and online MapReduce computations, and removes much of the tedium associated with building end-to-end aggregation pipelines---from the ingestion and processing of events to the publication of results in heterogeneous datastores. Clients are provided a query interface that powers dashboards and supports downstream ad hoc analytics."
Structured Streaming: A Declarative API for Real-Time Applications in Apache Spark,"With the ubiquity of real-time data, organizations need streaming systems that are scalable, easy to use, and easy to integrate into business applications. Structured Streaming is a new high-level streaming API in Apache Spark based on our experience with Spark Streaming. Structured Streaming differs from other recent streaming APIs, such as Google Dataflow, in two main ways. First, it is a purely declarative API based on automatically incrementalizing a static relational query (expressed using SQL or DataFrames), in contrast to APIs that ask the user to build a DAG of physical operators. Second, Structured Streaming aims to support end-to-end real-time applications that integrate streaming with batch and interactive analysis. We found that this integration was often a key challenge in practice. Structured Streaming achieves high performance via Spark SQL's code generation engine and can outperform Apache Flink by up to 2x and Apache Kafka Streams by 90x. It also offers rich operational features such as rollbacks, code updates, and mixed streaming/batch execution. We describe the system's design and use cases from several hundred production deployments on Databricks, the largest of which process over 1 PB of data per month."
TcpRT: Instrument and Diagnostic Analysis System for Service Quality of Cloud Databases at Massive Scale in Real-time,"Smooth end-to-end performance of mission-critical database system is essential to the stability of applications deployed on the cloud. It's a challenge for cloud database vendors to detect any performance degradation in real-time and locate the root cause quickly in sophisticated network environment. Cloud databases vendors tend to favor a multi-tier distributed architecture to achieve multi-tenant management, scalability and high-availability, which may further complicate the problem."
